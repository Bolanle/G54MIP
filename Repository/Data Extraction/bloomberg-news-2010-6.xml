Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest
software maker, sued Datel Design  Development Ltd., claiming
the U.K. company is infringing design patents for controllers
used with the Xbox 360 video-game system. 
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle today,
Microsoft is seeking damages and a court order that would halt
sales of Datel's TurboFire and WildFire controllers. Microsoft
also sued Datel in the U.K. and filed a complaint with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington, seeking to block
U.S. imports of the controllers made in China. 
The game controllers provide "a firepower advantage that
can make all the difference," Datel, based in Staffordshire,
England, said on its Web site. They can turn a single-shot
pistol in the "Call of Duty" into "lethal, fully automatic
weapons that can empty a clip on an enemy in a second." 
The patent complaints "appear retaliatory," Datel lawyer
Martin Glick said in a telephone interview. "They said the
controller would interfere with the fair play of games and then
they licensed a controller that did exactly that." 
Glick, of Howard Rice in San Francisco, said he hadn't
reviewed the complaints so couldn't comment on the specific
allegations. 
Unfair Advantage 
Microsoft has said in court filings that the accessories
give their users an unfair advantage in multiplayer gaming. The
TurboFire and WildFire controllers copy unique designs protected
by six U.S. patents, Microsoft said in the complaint. 
More than 74 million Xbox 360 game controllers have been
sold worldwide since 2005, including about 40 million in the
U.S., according to the ITC complaint. 
"The designs of the WildFire Controller are the same or
substantially the same to the eye of the ordinary observer as
the ornamental designs claimed in the Microsoft patents,"
Microsoft said. 
Datel also sells a memory card that it says is four times
as powerful as the one that Microsoft offers. In October,
Microsoft deployed what it called a "dashboard update" that
disabled Datel's memory cards. 
Datel filed an antitrust lawsuit in November against
Microsoft, claiming the Redmond, Washington-based company seeks
to monopolize the markets for multiplayer online gaming systems
and for accessories not sold directly with the Xbox. 
Memory Cards 
Glick, who called the update a "downgrade," said it was
designed to shut down Datel because the memory cards were
driving down the price of Microsoft's. 
Microsoft has asked that the antitrust suit be dismissed,
saying Datel isn't legally entitled to sell "accessories that
open the door for cheating that harms the Xbox 360 ecosystem." 
Microsoft said in the ITC complaint it has sold or licensed
more than $7 billion worth of products that use the patents at
issue in the case. "U.S. sales and licensing revenue for Xbox
360 gamepads alone account for more than $100 million," the
company said in the complaint. 
"The success of Microsoft's Xbox 360 has not gone
unnoticed by others who seek to gain from Microsoft's
investment, creativity and goodwill," the company said in the
filing. 
The new case is Microsoft Corp. v. Datel Design and
Development Ltd., 10cv562, U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington (Seattle). The antitrust case is Datel
Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp., 09cv5535, U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California (San Francisco). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Game Controllers,
Complaint No. 2722, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).

Microsoft Corp., the world's largest
software maker, has no plans to make a version of its Office
suite of programs to run on Apple Inc.'s iPad, said Stephen
Elop, president of Microsoft's business division. 
Elop said the company would take a "wait and see"
approach to tailoring software for the iPad, which goes on sale
on April 3. He also said Google Inc. hasn't made any headway
against Microsoft in the business software market. 
"We haven't heard anything about Google making inroads
against Office, because they're not," Elop said today in an
interview. Office includes word-processing, spreadsheet and
other business-productivity programs. 
Microsoft will begin selling the next version of the
product, dubbed Office 2010, on May 12. The debut comes as
Google and other Web companies are pushing alternatives that
cost less or are even free. Office brings in about 90 percent of
the revenue of Elop's division, which is the company's largest
and one of its most profitable. 
The version of Office 2010 that goes on sale on May 12 is
designed for businesses. A version for consumers will be
available by late June. By then, the company also will introduce
stripped-down versions of Word and the spreadsheet program Excel
that are accessible free over the Web. 
Demand looks promising, particularly from companies, and 6
million people have downloaded a prerelease "beta" version of
the product, Elop said. That's twice as many as downloaded the
beta version of Office 2007, the last upgrade. 
Of those beta users polled by Microsoft, 80 percent said
they would recommend Office 2010 to friends, and 90 percent said
the software made them more productive, he said. 
Cloud Computing 
Elop said corporate buyers are less interested in
discussing Google and other competitors and more concerned about
whether to move to new "cloud"-based versions of Microsoft
software. Customers who choose this route don't run the software
on their own computers, instead paying a monthly fee to
Microsoft to deliver it over the Internet from the company's
massive data centers. 
"We never say never, but we have no current plans" to
develop a version of Office for the Apple iPad, Elop said. Last
year Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it would create a
version to work on Nokia Oyj's smartphones, since millions of
Office users already own those devices. 
An iPad edition of Office would likely be built by a unit
within Microsoft's consumer business that creates versions of
Office that work with Apple's Macintosh personal computers.
Kristen Woody, a spokesman for that unit, says it "doesn't have
anything to share at this time." 
Microsoft fell 13 cents to $29.16 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. After gaining 57 percent last year,
the shares have slipped 4.3 percent in 2010.

Microsoft Corp. failed in its bid to
have a U.S. appeals court take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change its popular Word
software and resulted in a damage award that's grown to more
than $290 million. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit today
rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. 
Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. 
I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. 
Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. 
The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said he regrets using the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.'s guarantee program to issue $40 billion in
unsecured debt during the height of the financial crisis. 
"We didn't need it," Dimon, 54, said in his annual letter
to shareholders, which was released yesterday. "And it just
added to the argument that all banks had been bailed out and
fueled the anger directed toward banks." 
Dimon said the New York-based company was "highly
criticized" for issuing debt backed by the FDIC and for
accepting $25 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
The company repaid all TARP funds in June, stopped using the
FDIC's program last April and shunned participation in other
federal programs "to avoid the stigma," he said. 
JPMorgan, which ranks second behind Bank of America Corp.
in deposits and assets among U.S. lenders, remained profitable
through the crisis with combined net income of $17.3 billion in
the last two years. The company issued $20.8 billion in FDIC-
guaranteed long-term debt in 2008, and $19.7 billion in 2009. 
"It was not a question of access or need," Dimon said of
the FDIC program, whose government backing helped keep interest
rates low. "The markets always were open to us, but the program
did save us money." 
FDIC Program 
FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment. About 6,500
eligible institutions opted out of the Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program. More than 80 banks and thrifts used the
program to issue debt, about $305.4 billion of which was still
outstanding as of Feb. 28, according to FDIC data. 
Dimon apologized for what he said were the bank's mistakes.
He said the two biggest were lowering mortgage underwriting
standards and making too many leveraged loans that "may have
contributed to the financial crisis." At the same time, he
claimed some credit for helping to stabilize markets through
JPMorgan's purchases of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual. 
He also sought to deflect some of the public anger toward
financial companies and to correct the perception that all banks
would have failed if the federal government hadn't intervened. 
"We should acknowledge that the worst offenders among
financial companies no longer are in existence," Dimon said.
"And while it is true that some of the surviving banks would
not, or might not, have survived, not all banks would have
failed." 
Dimon, who took over as CEO in 2005, said his "No. 1
priority" this year is to find his successor. 
Internal Candidates 
"Poor CEO succession has destroyed many a company," Dimon
said, adding that the board believes there are several strong
internal candidates that could "do my job today." He said
JPMorgan will continue rotating senior staff across the business
to ensure they could smoothly take over the company. 
The company also intends to expand retail banking, which
accounted for $97 million of JPMorgan's $11.7 billion in net
income last year. Dimon said the bank will add 2,700 personal
bankers, 400 investment sales representatives and 120 more
branches this year, even though consumer lending lost $3.8
billion in 2009. The bank plans to ramp up its branch expansion
in California and Florida over the next two years, building on
its acquisition of Washington Mutual, he said.

Shopping mall owner General Growth
Properties Inc. filed definitive documents last night to raise
$6.55 billion in new equity from three investors in return for
65 percent of the stock. General Growth is setting up a bidding
procedure where other investors could end up being the equity
sponsors. 
In return for agreeing to be the so-called stalking-horse,
the three investors -- Fairholme Capital Management LLC,
Pershing Square Capital Management LP, and Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. -- will be given warrants for 120 million shares
exercisable at $15 a share. General Growth said in its court
filing last night that the warrants are worth $520 million. 
Combined with $1.5 billion through a new debt offering or
reinstatement of existing debt, General Growth says it will have
enough capital to confirm a plan at the holding company level.
Only $1 billion in debt at the property-owning level remains to
be formally reorganized through confirmation of reorganization
plans. 
General Growth says the plan will be sufficient to pay
unsecured creditors in full with interest. 
At an April 29 hearing, General Growth will ask the
bankruptcy judge to approve the warrants to the stalking-horse
investors and a schedule for wrapping up the case. General
Growth wants the first round of bids submitted by April 19, even
before the judge has approved procedures. 
General Growth is offering as much as $1 million in expense
reimbursement for anyone who participates in the bidding
process. 
The second round of bids would be due June 2, if the judge
agrees with the schedule. General Growth and representatives of
existing stockholders will then compare the bids, negotiate
further, and select the winning investors in time for filing a
reorganization plan and disclosure statement on July 2. 
The hearing for approval of the disclosure statement would
take place July 30, followed by a confirmation hearing for
approval of the plan on Sept. 30. 
Assuming there are no other bids, Fairholme would end up
with 28 percent of the new stock for a $2.8 billion investment.
Pershing Square is in line for 11 percent for $1.1 billion, and
Brookfield would receive 26 percent for $2.625 billion. 
Existing shareholders will retain 34 percent of the stock
through the Chapter 11 plan. Existing equity holders will also
receive 80 percent of the equity in a new company to own non-
core assets. 
General Growth also filed an operating report yesterday
showing $70.1 million in operating income during February on
revenue of $204.5 million. Interest expense in the month was
$91.7 million. 
The month produced $208.6 million in net income thanks to a
$222.9 million gain on reorganization items. In February, the
loss before  taxes, non-controlling interests and reorganization
items was $21.6 million. 
In seven batches of confirmations since December, General
Growth has formally reorganized property-owning subsidiaries
holding all except $1 billion on debt below the holding
companies. 
General Growth began the largest real estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The books
of Chicago-based General Growth had assets of $29.6 billion and
total liabilities of $27.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2008. It owns
or manages more than 200 shopping-mall properties. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
Updates 
Crescent Selects UBS and Aladdin as Lead Arrangers 
Real estate developer Crescent Resources LLC jilted RBS
Securities Inc. and instead intends on marrying itself to other
arrangers for a $125 million secured financing to aid in an exit
from bankruptcy reorganization. Creditors are voting on the
Crescent Chapter 11 plan in advance of a May 20 confirmation
hearing. 
Although the bankruptcy court already approved using RBS to
serve as lead arranger, Crescent said in a March 30 bankruptcy
court filing that UBS Securities LLC and Aladdin Capital LLC
made a better offer that has a "higher likelihood of success"
and contains "more favorable terms for the debtors." 
Crescent arranged an April 5 hearing for approval of the
agreement with UBS and Aladdin. For other Bloomberg coverage,
click here. 
Crescent's disclosure statement tells holders of $1.55
billion in pre-bankruptcy loans that they stand to recover 38
percent by receiving all the new stock and $265 million in two
tranches of second-lien notes. 
General unsecured creditors with almost $305 million in
claims are to be given the senior interest in a litigation
trust. The pre-bankruptcy lenders will have a subordinate
interest in the trust. The disclosure statement doesn't specify
the percentage recovery unsecured creditors are to receive. 
Secured lenders with mortgages against specific projects
are being paid in full, in some cases by receiving their
collateral. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Crescent filed under
Chapter 11 in June with commercial, residential and multifamily
projects in 10 southeastern and southwestern states. It listed
assets of $2.2 billion against debt totaling $1.9 billion,
including almost $1.5 billion on pre-bankruptcy credit
agreements. Crescent is a joint venture between Duke Energy
Corp. and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. 
The case is In re Crescent Resources LLC, 09-11507, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Western District Texas (Austin). 
Lehman Proposes Buying Up Notes Underlying Flip Deals 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed a motion asking for
authority to extricate itself from derivate and swap agreements
where there are disputes about Lehman's rights. 
Many of the transactions involve a so-called flip clause in
a swap where collateral ordinarily would go first to a Lehman
subsidiary as the swap counterparty. Under the flip clause, the
bankruptcy of the swap counterparty or an affiliate would have
the collateral go first to noteholders and only to Lehman after
the noteholders were fully paid. 
The bankruptcy judge gave Lehman a victory when he ruled on
Jan. 25 in one of the transactions that the flip clause violates
a provision in bankruptcy law prohibiting so-called ipso facto
clauses where someone loses rights simply for filing in
bankruptcy or becoming insolvent. 
Despite Lehman's victory, the liquidating broker said the
counterparties aren't settling and in some cases are asserting
rights under foreign law where the result might follow an
English decision upholding the flip clause. 
To short circuit the third parties, Lehman is asking for
authority to buy up enough notes so it can force the liquidation
of collateral in particular transactions. Given Lehman's success
in litigation, the motion says that the notes are often trading
for less than market value. 
By buying up enough notes in a transaction, Lehman says it
may also have power in some cases to force settlement. Lehman
believes that buying notes will bring a quicker result than
litigating each transaction separately. 
If the bankruptcy judge grants the motion at an April 20
hearing, Lehman could buy as much as $25 million in notes in any
particular transaction so long as a creditors' committee
financial professional does not object within six hours. For
individual purchases more than $25 million, the judge must
approve if the creditors' committee doesn't consent. 
To read about the January decision regarding flip
transactions, click here and look for the Advance Sheets item in
the Feb. 1 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. 
More than 20 financial institutions and creditors objected
to Lehman's proposal for alternative dispute resolution of
claims. Wells Fargo Bank NA, for example, contends that the
three-step process is too time consuming and expensive for
creditors. The bank, as trustee in securitization trusts,
objects to how Lehman can name four mediators from which the
creditors must select one. 
The bank wants the ability to make counter proposals when
Lehman submits a settlement offer in advance of mediation. The
bank wants the right to attend mediation through teleconference
rather than being required to be present in person in New York. 
Wells Fargo and others want the ability to compel Lehman to
produce information in advance of mediation. 
The hearing for approval of mediation procedures is on the
bankruptcy court calendar for consideration at an April 14
hearing. 
Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP, Lehman's chief bankruptcy
counsel, disclosed in a bankruptcy court filing this week that
its top partners are charging $990 an hour. The least-expensive
partner's hourly rate is $725. The top rate for associates is
$695. The top rate for a partner from a foreign office $1,000. 
From the inception of the Chapter 11 case in September 2008
through February, Weil Gotshal charged Lehman $157.5 million. To
read other Bloomberg coverage, click here. 
The Lehman holding company filed under Chapter 11 in New
York on Sept. 15, 2008, and sold office buildings and the North
American investment banking business to London-based Barclays
Plc one week later. The Lehman brokerage operations went into
liquidation on Sept. 19, 2008, in the same court. The brokerage
is in the control of a trustee appointed under the Securities
Investor Protection Act. 
The Lehman holding company Chapter 11 case is In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, while the liquidation
proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act for the
brokerage operation is Securities Investors Protection Corp. v.
Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District New York (Manhattan). 
Accredited Home at Impasse with Lone Star on Plan 
Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., a home mortgage
originator and securitizer prior to the Chapter 11 filing in
May, says negotiations on a Chapter 11 plan are at "impasse." 
The indenture trustee for junior subordinated noteholders
sued the owner Lone Star Funds, alleging fraudulent
representations were made in connection with the $300 million
acquisition in 2007. Since then, there were negotiations on a
Chapter 11 plan that failed, Accredited Home said in a March 29
motion for an extension of the exclusive right to propose a
Chapter 11 plan. 
The company says that the noteholders asked to hold up the
plan process for at least three months. To accommodate the
request, the company is asking to stretch out the exclusive
plan-filing right until Nov. 1. 
A hearing on the exclusivity motion will take place April
21. 
In the motion, Accredited Home said it filed a tax return
in February asking for a $57 million refund. The refund hasn't
yet been received. 
The creditors' committee already has a motion on the April
21 calendar for authority to bring claims on behalf of the
company against Dallas-based Lone Star. 
Accredited sold the mortgage servicing business in July
after the Chapter 11 filing in May. Most of the mortgage loans
were sold later. Lone Star also owns Bruno's Supermarkets LLC
and Bi-Lo LLC, two grocery retailers in Chapter 11. 
The Chapter 11 petition said assets are less than $50
million while debt exceeds $100 million. 
The case is In re Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., 09-
11516, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Still No LBO Settlement and No Reorg Plan for Tribune 
Newspaper publisher Tribune Co. is asking for a fifth
extension of the exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. 
The creditors' committee supports extending the deadline by
one month, to April 30. Tribune is aiming for an April 13
hearing on the so-called exclusivity motion. 
Tribune filed an operating report yesterday showing a $2.7
million net profit in February on $221.8 million in revenue. 
The case remains stuck in disputes over whether the $13.8
billion leveraged buyout led by Sam Zell in December 2007
resulted in fraudulent transfers. Tribune reiterated its belief
that settling the claims through a plan is the best outcome. 
Tribune said it couldn't provide details on negotiations
due to "confidentiality concerns." It promised to make more
disclosures before the April 13 hearing. 
The operating report has a $16.4 million operating profit
in February. Reorganization costs that cut into net profit
totaled $7.4 million. 
Creditors are working on the theory that the LBO was a
fraudulent transfer because operating subsidiaries put liens on
their assets to finance the Zell acquisition while not receiving
commensurate value in return. 
Tribune is the second-largest newspaper publisher in the
U.S. Tribune listed $13 billion in debt for borrowed money and
assets of $7.6 billion in the Chapter 11 reorganization begun in
December 2008. It owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times,
six other newspapers and 23 television stations. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District Delaware (Wilmington). 
Lyondell Settles Environmental Claim to Ease Confirmation 
Chemical producer Lyondell Chemical Co. negotiated a
settlement of $5.5 billion in environmental claims, in the
process removing an obstacle to approval of the reorganization
plan at the April 23 confirmation hearing. 
Under the plan and the settlement, Lyondell will transfer
specific environmentally impaired properties it owns to a trust
along with cash to perform a cleanup. 
All together, the U.S. government and seven states will
have approved unsecured claims aggregating $1.18 billion. In
addition, Lyondell will contribute $108.4 million cash to the
trust and pay another $61.6 million to settle other claims. 
The settlement will be up for approval at the April 23
confirmation hearing. To read other Bloomberg coverage, click
here. 
Financing for Lyondell's plan includes a backstopped $2.8
billion equity rights offering plus $5 billion in debt financing
via an asset-backed facility, a note offering, and a term loan. 
To read about the plan and the settlement with the
unsecured creditors' committee, click here and look for the
Lyondell item in the March 9 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. 
Lyondell and affiliate Equistar Chemicals LP, together
making up the third-largest independent producer of chemicals,
filed under Chapter 11 in January 2009, listing assets of $33.8
billion and debt totaling $30.3 billion. The parent
LyondellBasell Industries AF SCA filed under Chapter 11 in
April. Including the parent and European subsidiaries, the
assets were $40 billion in September 2008. Total revenue in 2007
was $44 billion. The Lyondell petition says its assets are $27.1
billion against $19.3 billion in debt while Equistar listed
assets and debt both totaling $9 billion. 
The case is Lyondell Chemical Co., 09-10023, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Madoff Trustee Changing Market-Maker Business Sale 
The trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc. agreed to modify the contract with Castor Pollux Securities
LLC, which purchased the Madoff market-making business in June
2009 for $1 million cash plus as much as another $24.5 million
based on gross revenue through December 2013. Without modifying
the contract, the trustee said in his March 30 bankruptcy court
filing that Castor Pollux, now formally named Surge Trading
Inc., would go out of business. 
So far, Surge has paid the upfront price plus $3.39 million
on the earnout. Surge's problems arise from the remainder of the
earnout that represents a contingent liability precluding the
company from compliance with net capital requirements and
blocking the auditor from certifying the 2009 financial
statements. 
To solve the problem, the Madoff trustee agreed that Surge
could transfer the business to a newly formed subsidiary not
directly liable for the earnout. The trustee said he negotiated
provisions in the agreement "to mitigate" the possibly of not
being paid. 
The agreement will come to bankruptcy court for approval at
an April 16 hearing. 
The Madoff firm began liquidating in December 2008 with the
appointment of a trustee under the SIPA. Madoff himself went
into an involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation in April. His
bankruptcy case was consolidated with the firm's liquidation. 
The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection
Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc., 08-01789,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District New York (Manhattan).
The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-cr-00213, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
BankUnited Wants Exclusivity until Tax Return Filed 
BankUnited Financial Corp., the holding company whose bank
was taken over and sold by regulators in May, is proposing a
novel approach for a deadline on the exclusive right to propose
a Chapter 11 plan. 
BankUnited says that tax attributes are among the "most
valuable assets." The holding company is currently in the
process of selecting tax advisers to prepare the return for the
period ended in September. 
The tax attributes include net operating loss carrybacks,
refund rights and loss carryforwards. 
BankUnited says that a plan can't be worked out until there
is a good picture of the tax situation. Therefore, the holding
company wants so-called exclusivity extended until 90 days after
the tax return is filed. 
A major issue in the case is the $4.9 billion claim filed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for the
failed bank subsidiary. While BankUnited believes a
"substantial portion" of the claim is "simply invalid,"
leaving the claim untouched would "dominate the distribution
scheme under any plan and significantly dilute the return
available to other creditors." 
BankUnited filed lists of assets and creditors, showing
$557 million owing to unsecured creditors. There are no secured
claims. Assets were listed for $21 million. 
The bank's failure cost the FDIC $4.9 billion. It had
deposits of $8.6 billion and $12.8 billion in assets. Debt of
the Coral Gables, Florida-based holding company includes $120
million on convertible senior notes, $12.5 million of junior
subordinated debentures, $184 million in mandatorily convertible
senior notes known as HiMeds, and $237 million in trust
preferred securities. 
The case is In re BankUnited Financial Corp., 09-19940,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District Florida (Miami). 
Control of W Hotel Union Square Thrown into Doubt 
Whether one of three mezzanine lenders to the W New York
Union Square hotel had the right to file a Chapter 11 petition
on March 23 was thrown into doubt yesterday in a lawsuit filed
in bankruptcy court by Union Square Real Holding Corp., the new
owner of a mezzanine loan on the hotel. 
In the complaint, USRHC is asking the bankruptcy judge to
prevent the bankrupt mezzanine lender, Hotels Union Square Mezz
1 LLC, from putting the hotel itself into Chapter 11. 
USRHC explains in the complaint how the $285 million
acquisition of the hotel in October 2006 was financed by a $115
million first mortgage, three mezzanine loans totaling $117
million, and a $53 million equity investment by an affiliate of
Dubai World. 
USRHC spent $3.6 million on March 9 to buy a second $37
million mezzanine loan. USRHC made the new investment to protect
its $53 million investment in the hotel. 
Exercising rights under a pledge agreement, USRHC alleges
that on March 22 it removed all of the officers of Hotels Union
Square Mezz 1 LLC. Nonetheless, according to the complaint, the
incumbent officers went ahead and authorized the Chapter 11
filing on March 23. 
The complaint says that Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC has
a pledge of the ownership interest in the hotel itself. USRHC
said it will ask the bankruptcy judge to block a Chapter 11
filing for the hotel itself. 
A date for a hearing on a motion for a temporary injunction
hadn't been set by yesterday afternoon. HSRHC wants to prevent a
bankruptcy by the hotel to fend off a default on the $115
million first mortgage which is current. USRHC says income is
sufficient to pay operating expenses and debt service the first
mortgage. 
The case is In re Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC, 10-10971,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Neenah Submits Plan Negotiated Before February Filing 
Neenah Foundry Co., a producer of cast-iron products such
as manhole covers and sewer grates, filed a reorganization plan
and explanatory disclosure statement designed to bring
conclusion to the second venture into Chapter 11. 
Neenah filed under Chapter 11 on Feb. 3 after hashing out
agreement on a plan with holders of 55 percent of secured notes
and all the subordinated notes. 
The hearing for approval of the disclosure statement is
scheduled for April 27. 
The plan would exchange the $237.5 million outstanding on
9.5 percent senior secured notes for 97 percent of the new stock
plus a new $50 million secured loan. Tontine Capital Partners
LP, the controlling shareholder and holder of the $88.7 million
in 12.5 percent senior subordinated notes, is to have 3 percent
of the new equity plus warrants to purchase 10 percent. 
The draft disclosure statement has blanks where senior and
subordinated creditors ultimately will be told the predicted
percentage recovery. 
The $55.2 million secured working capital loan is to be
paid in full or reinstated. 
Trade suppliers are to be paid in full. The petition listed
assets of $287 million against debt totaling $449.1 million. 
Neenah was in Chapter 11 before. The company confirmed a
prepackaged plan in September 2003 that had been filed the
previous month. The plan exchanged senior subordinated notes for
$100 million in new subordinated debt, $30 million cash and half
of the stock. Trade creditors were paid in full. 
Neenah, from a Wisconsin town of the same name, reported a
$150 million net loss for the Sept. 30 fiscal year on net sales
of $333 million. In fiscal 2008, net sales were $511 million,
and the net loss was $12 million. 
The case is In re Neenah Enterprises Inc., 10-10360, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Lake at Las Vegas Scheduled for June 21 Confirmation 
Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC scheduled a June 21
confirmation hearing for approval of the Chapter 11 plan when
the bankruptcy judge this week approved the explanatory
disclosure statement. 
The committee representing unsecured creditors supports the
plan following an agreement with secured lenders owed $626
million. The committee believes that the plan has a better
outcome than success in a lawsuit against the lenders. 
The plan for the master developer of the Lake Las Vegas
Resort 17 miles from the Las Vegas Strip allows a lawsuit go to
forward against Sid Bass, Lee Bass and other former owners of
the project. Creditors drop the suit the committee began in July
against an affiliate of Credit Suisse Group AG, which was a
secured lender and agent for the secured creditors. 
The plan is to convert the secured lenders' $127 million
loan for the reorganization into 94 percent of the new equity.
For their more than $627 million in pre-bankruptcy secured
claims, the lenders will take 1 percent of the new equity,
warrants that currently would have no value, and 80 percent of
net recoveries from the lawsuit against the insiders. 
Unsecured creditors are expected to recover 4.5 percent
from a $1 million cash fund plus 20 percent of lawsuit
recoveries. 
Lot owners will waive claims in return for remapping
properties so they will have marketable title. 
The disclosure statement says that the plan is better for
unsecured creditors than victory in the lawsuit because the
creditors find no defects in the $127 million secured claim
financing the reorganization. The disclosure statement says that
the property is not worth enough to pay off the so-called DIP
loan. 
The suit contended that the loan from Credit Suisse in 2004
was a fraudulent transfer because all but $100 million from the
$560 million loan went directly to the owners. 
The formal lists of assets and liabilities showed $719
million in claims belonging to secured creditors, with the first
mortgage totaling $671 million. 
The development is a 3,600-acre master-planned community
with a 320-acre man-made lake next to the Lake Mead National
Recreational Area. It has three golf course, two hotels, a
casino, retail stores and more than 1,600 completed residential
units. The Chapter 11 filing was in July 2008. 
The case is Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC, 08-17814,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). 
Hawaii Medical Taps Gemino for Possible Financing 
Hawaii Medical Center LLC, the operator of two hospitals in
Honolulu, filed a motion on March 30 along with the creditors'
committee for authority to pay $75,000 in fees so Gemino
Healthcare Finance LLC will undertake the financial
investigation necessary to commit to provide $10 million in
financing for the hospitals' reorganization plan. 
Three plans have been competing for the right to reorganize
the hospitals. The bankruptcy judge already approved a
disclosure statement explaining the Chapter 11 plan proposed by
St. Francis Healthcare System of Hawaii. The St. Francis plan is
scheduled for a May 24 confirmation hearing. 
The bankruptcy judge has yet to give formal approval for
the disclosure statements accompanying the plans proposed by the
hospitals and the official creditors' committee. 
The hospitals say they need financing from Gemino to be in
place by May 23 so their plan could be confirmed instead of the
St. Francis plan on May 24. 
The hospitals originally filed for Chapter 11
reorganization in Delaware in August 2008. The cases were moved
to Hawaii in September 2008. The hospitals have 342 beds in
total. 
The case is CHA Hawaii LLC, 08-01369, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Hawaii (Honolulu). 
New Filings 
Medical Imaging Developer Eigen Files in Delaware 
Eigen Inc., a developer of technology to view and biopsy
prostate glands using three-dimensional ultrasound, filed a
Chapter 11 petition on March 30 in Delaware. 
The Grass Valley, California-based company owes more than
$20 million to the secured lender Kazi Management IV LLC.
Unsecured creditors are owed $1 million, with half representing
a claim held by General Electric Capital Corp. 
Before bankruptcy, Kazi was foreclosing. The foreclosure
was enjoined by a state court in California by former employees,
bankruptcy court papers say. 
Kazi is providing $2 million of new money financing for the
Chapter 11 case. 
The case is In re Eigen Inc., 10-11061, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
U.S. to Help Grant Forest Sale to Georgia-Pacific 
Grant Forest Products Inc., a Canada-based producer of
oriented strand board, filed a Chapter 15 petition late
yesterday in Delaware for protection from creditors in the U.S. 
Grant filed for reorganization in Ontario Superior Court in
June. The company has plants in Ontario, Alberta and South
Carolina. 
The petition said assets and debt both exceed $500 million.
Debt includes $398 million on first-lien obligations and $150
million on second-lien claims. 
The court in Canada already approved a sale of assets to
Georgia-Pacific LLC. The Chapter 15 case in part would assist in
implementation of the sale. 
If the bankruptcy judge in Delaware concludes that Canada
is home to the "foreign main proceeding," he will permanently
halt creditor actions in the U.S. and assist in implementation
of the Canadian reorganization. Most unsecured creditors in the
U.S. are not to be affected by the reorganization. 
The case is In re Grant Forest Products Inc., 10-11132,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Watch List 
Oil Producer Petroflow Has Problems with Lenders 
Petroflow Energy Ltd., an oil and natural gas production
company from Denver, was unable to sell the Oklahoma properties
by March 7. As a result, a forbearance agreement ended with bank
lenders, the company said in a statement yesterday. 
As a result, the banks terminated Petroflow's hedging
positions, generating $4.75 million that paid down the bank debt
to $98.75 million. The company said that the banks took
operational control of the primary operating accounts. 
Compounding the problems, Petroflow said a farmout
agreement was terminated for an alleged default. As a result,
purchasers are holding back payments, and liens have been placed
against the wells. 
Petroflow has yet to file audited financial statements for
2008 and 2009. The company said in the statement that the new
auditors expect to complete the filings in Canada by April 9. 
Petroflow said there is no assurance it can continue as a
going concern. 
The closing high for Petroflow's stock in the last two
years was $9.11 on June 17, 2008. In trading yesterday before
the announcement, the stock was above 26 cents. After the
announcement, the stock traded as low as 19 cents and closed at
22 cents, down 5 cents for the day.

Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay about
$400,000 to settle a lawsuit mid-trial that blamed its Neurontin
epilepsy medicine for helping cause a Massachusetts man&#8217;s
suicide, two people familiar with the accord said. 
It&#8217;s the first settlement over a Neurontin-related suicide
claim. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, agreed yesterday
to resolve allegations by Hartley Shearer&#8217;s family in Boston
federal court that its Warner-Lambert unit knew the drug posed a
suicide risk and failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. 
&#8220;Pfizer agreed to settle the case for less than its
defense costs remaining in this case,&#8221; said Rob Haralson, a
spokesman for New York-based Pfizer. &#8220;Pfizer maintains that it
has strong defenses to each of plaintiff&#8217;s claims.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. The settlement comes a week after
another Boston jury ordered Pfizer to pay more than $140 million
in damages to an insurer over the drug. Pfizer has denied any
wrongdoing in connection with its handling of Neurontin. 
Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a
$430 million fine. Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
For 16 Months 
The 57-year-old Shearer, a part-time lecturer at Williams
College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, took Neurontin for 16
months before killing himself, according to court filings. 
Shearer&#8217;s family contends his doctor wasn&#8217;t aware of
Neurontin&#8217;s suicide risk when he prescribed the drug to help
deal with pain generated by a 1999 stroke. 
Pfizer argued Shearer battled depression for most of his
life and was taking a dozen prescription drugs, including an
anti-depressant, when he shot himself to death with a .357
Magnum handgun in 2002. 
The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers also noted Shearer argued with his
wife the day he killed himself and left a suicide note saying it
was the last time she would &#8220;leave me powerless.&#8221; 
Ron Rosenkranz, a lawyer for the Shearers, declined to
comment when contacted yesterday evening. Today, he told U.S.
District Judge William G. Young at a hearing in Boston that the
&#8220;amount of the settlement, while confidential, is substantially
less than the amount reported.&#8221; 
&#8216;An Iffy Case&#8217; 
&#8220;This is an iffy case,&#8221; Young told jurors after
announcing the accord. &#8220;This is why they settled. Iffy on both
sides.&#8221; The people who said the settlement was about $400,000
declined to be identified because the terms are confidential. 
By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Shearer&#8217;s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. 
Dr. Charles King, a former Harvard University business
professor, told jurors in the Shearer case yesterday that
Warner-Lambert officials used illegal off-label marketing
tactics to turn Neurontin into a &#8220;blockbuster drug.&#8221; 
&#8220;They took a drug that was expected to generate
$500 million over its lifetime and turned it into a drug that
sold roughly $10 billion,&#8221; said King, an economist who
testified for the Shearers as an expert on pharmaceutical-
industry marketing practices. 
The Shearer suit was the second product-liability case over
Neurontin to go to trial. 
In July 2009, a Peabody, Massachusetts, family dropped its
suit over the suicide of a woman who was taking the drug. The
family was in the second day of trial in federal court in Boston
when it decided to dismiss the case. 
Misleading Doctors 
Another jury in Boston&#8217;s federal court March 25 said Pfizer
must pay Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. $47.4 million for
misleading doctors on whether Neurontin was effective for
illnesses such as migraines and bipolar disorder. 
The jury found the drugmaker violated the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, and
California&#8217;s Unfair Competition Law. 
The Oakland, California-based insurer is a unit of Kaiser
Permanente, the largest U.S. nonprofit health maintenance
organization. Under RICO, the amount of actual damages will be
tripled to $142.1 million. 
Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in 2000 and
Pharmacia for $54 billion three years later. 
$430 Million Settlement 
Along with the $430 million settlement of allegations over
Neurontin, Pfizer also paid $2.3 billion in October 2009 to
resolve U.S. Justice Department allegations it illegally
marketed the painkiller Bextra and three other drugs. 
&#8220;When you acquire Warner-Lambert you get Neurontin, and
when you acquire Pharmacia you get Bextra, and some of these
problems came with the acquisitions,&#8221; Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer&#8217;s
chief executive officer told the New York Times March 31. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t change the facts or our responsibility for them.&#8221; 
The Shearer case is Shearer v. Pfizer Inc., 07-cv-11428-

A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. buyout
firm bought a minority stake in David Ganek&#8217;s $4 billion Level
Global Investors LP, adding a hedge fund that can bet on rising
as well as falling stock prices globally. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Petershill Fund Offshore LP, a $1 billion
fund set up to buy minority stakes in hedge funds, won&#8217;t get any
management or investment decision-making role with the
acquisition, according to a letter Ganek sent to clients
yesterday. New York-based Level Global said it will use the
proceeds from the sale to help attract and retain top talent. 
&#8220;We believe this investment by Petershill is an important
milestone in the continued development of Level Global&#8217;s
investment management platform as an institutional quality
business,&#8221; Ganek and managing partner Anthony Chiasson said in
the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Ganek, an alumnus of Steven A. Cohen&#8217;s Stamford,
Connecticut-based SAC Capital Advisors LLC, founded Level Global
in 2003. The firm has 64 employees, of which 25 are investment
professionals. Petershill has interests in three London-based
funds, Capula Investment Management LLP, Winton Capital
Management Ltd. and Trafalgar Asset Managers Ltd., as well as in
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Shumway Capital Partners LLC. 
Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Level Global, and Melissa
Daly, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment. 
Hedge funds are loosely regulated private partnerships that

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. aren't doing "God's work" when it comes
to derivatives, according to investor groups of nuns and
priests. 
Shareholders will vote starting this month on proposals
sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and 14
other religious organizations, asking Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to give more
information on the collateral used in their derivatives trading. 
It's the first time the four banks, among the largest U.S.
swaps dealers, will put to a nonbinding vote a call to explain
how collateral of derivatives customers is used and to keep it
from other accounts. Congress is considering bills that would
require more derivatives deals be processed through
clearinghouses, privately owned third parties that guarantee
transactions and keep track of collateral and margin. 
"The use of these instruments, if they're not disclosed by
the dealers and the information made available, by their very
nature can contribute to systemic risk," said Father Seamus
Finn, a director with the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate
in Washington, D.C., one of the co-sponsors of the resolutions. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in February
and March decisions, backed the religious groups' bid to put the
proposal up for a vote by shareholders of JPMorgan, Bank of
America and Citigroup. New York-based Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, agreed separately to add
the resolution to its proxy statement. 
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein's
remark in November that he's a banker doing "God's work" was
an "inscrutable comment," Finn said. "He was part of a group
of very senior people from the banking sector who appeared to
have been advised by their PR people to acknowledge their
mistakes but more pointedly assert the uprightness of their
intentions." 
The ICCR 
Blankfein, 55, didn't mean for the remark to be taken
seriously, Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said that
month. 
The religious groups, members of the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, hold shares in the four banks ranging
from 100 at Goldman Sachs to 63,977 at Citigroup. The New York-
based ICCR's 300 members include money managers for various
religious organizations, including Jewish and Buddhist, and
pension and mutual funds that oversee $100 billion in assets,
according to the organization's Web site. 
"The immorality of the financial crisis is rooted in the
fact that these derivatives contracts weren't based on creating
value and didn't create incentives for people to keep their
promises," said Laura Berry, a former large-cap portfolio
manager for Citigroup who is executive director of the ICCR,
which is coordinating the proxy votes for the religious groups. 
200 Proposals 
ICCR's members have placed 200 social and environmental
measures on proxy ballots this year, including the use of
antibiotics in animal feed at Tyson Foods Inc. and carbon
emissions at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Berry said. The organization
filed its first shareholder resolution in 1971, pressuring
General Motors Corp. to divest from South Africa because of what
was then the country's apartheid policy of racial segregation. 
"They do very good work," said Charles Elson, director of
the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware. "I don't always agree with them, but
some of the stuff they've done is quite good." 
JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and
Morgan Stanley were parties to 96 percent of the $293 trillion
in over-the-counter derivatives trades made by the top 25 U.S.
bank-holding companies as of Dec. 31, according to the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency. The religious groups didn't
seek to place a resolution on Morgan Stanley's proxy because
none have held the bank's shares long enough, said Finn. 
Banks Say Reject 
The religious organizations want the four broker-dealers to
disclose internal policies on how the collateral posted by
derivatives customers is used. They're also asking the lenders
to segregate the collateral from other accounts, which would
prohibit it from being used for anything else. 
"We were very much concerned about where's the collateral,
is this all recorded, do we know who the second or third party
is to this, the counterparties and so on," said Sister Barbara
Aires, coordinator of corporate responsibility at the Sisters of
Charity of Saint Elizabeth, in Convent Station, New Jersey. 
The banks have urged shareholders in their proxy
statements to reject the proposal. JPMorgan said that
segregating assets could expose it to price volatility and
potential losses "when the firm needs to liquidate collateral
quickly upon a default." 
JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli, Goldman Sachs
spokesman Michael DuVally, Bank of America spokesman Scott
Silvestri and Citigroup spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to
comment beyond the companies' proxy statements. 
Proposals focusing on specific business issues like
derivatives trading "tend not to do well" in shareholder
votes, said Elson. "They're really issues of the board. But in
this climate, you can't say anything is for sure."

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and other banks objected to
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s plan to build its real estate
unit into an asset-management business. 
The business would be &#8220;a reorganization plan for debtors&#8217;
employees and management separate, apart and ahead of the
reorganization plan for creditors,&#8221; the banks said yesterday in
a court filing. 
A unit called Lamco, staffed by current employees and
managers, would run the defunct investment bank&#8217;s real estate
and private-equity assets, also taking on business from outside,
Lehman said in March. 
The Lehman parent would have sole control and ownership of
the assets, denying &#8220;any governance or ownership interest&#8221; to
affiliates that helped to fund Lamco, or to creditors, the banks
said. They described the proposed Lamco deal as an &#8220;insider
transaction,&#8221; not an &#8220;arms-length sale.&#8221; 
The objection was filed by seven banks and two investment
companies that are derivatives creditors of a Lehman affiliate,
including Merrill Lynch  Co., its parent Bank of America Corp.
and Deutsche Bank AG. By putting Lehman managers and employees
ahead of creditors, Lamco would turn the Chapter 11
reorganization &#8220;on its head,&#8221; they said. 
Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment. 
Lehman&#8217;s U.K. units objected to the plan in a separate
filing, saying Lehman hadn&#8217;t provided enough information to
assess its merits. 
A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for April 14 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

The banks said the planned business would be "a

Microsoft Corp. failed to persuade a
U.S. appeals court to take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change the company's popular
Word software and resulted in a damage award that has grown to
more than $290 million. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April
1 rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. 
Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. 
I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. 
Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. 
The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). 
Amazon.com Gets U.S. Patent for Order Tracking by Video 
Amazon.com Inc., the largest online retailer, received a
patent for video tracking of order processing. 
Patent 7,689,465, issued March 30, covers the capture of
images of an order being processed, and the sending of those
images to the customer. 
The technology can also be used to notify third parties,
who pay to have their promotional material included in a
shipment, according to the patent. A customer will be able to
see her own name and address put on the order, and what is
included in the order, before it is shipped. 
The invention also may be used to verify customer
complaints about an order, according to the patent. 
Amazon applied for the patent in March 2005 with assistance
from Meyertons, Hood, Kivlin, Kowert  Goetzel PC of Austin,
Texas. 
New Zealand Lawmakers Propose Barring Software Patents 
New Zealand lawmakers are considering changing that
country's patent code to outlaw software patents. 
Parliament's Commerce Select Committee made its final
recommendation in a 197-page report released at the end of
March. 
The committee said the patenting of software is
"inconsistent" with the open-source model. Permitting software
patents would "stifle innovation and competition," the
committee said in its report. 
The report noted that the issue of embedded software is
problematic and urged the Intellectual Property Office of New
Zealand to develop guidelines for inventions containing embedded
software. 
In addition to software, the new law would ban the
patenting of plant varieties, human beings and biological
processes for their generation, methods of treating humans by
surgery and therapy, and methods of diagnosis practiced on human
beings. 
New Zealand's present patent law, enacted in 1953, was
based on a 1949 U.K. patent bill that has since been repealed. 
Existing New Zealand patent law "has a low threshold for
patentability compared with most other countries," according to
the committee's report. This low threshold "can lead to broader
patent rights" in New Zealand than in other countries. 
As a result, technology that may be freely available in
other countries may be protected by patents in New Zealand.
Lawmakers said this has the potential to discourage innovation
and inhibit growth in productivity and exports.

EBay Wins Tiffany Trademark Appeal, Faces Ad Claim 
EBay Inc. didn't infringe Tiffany  Co.'s trademark because
of fake goods sold on its Web site, an appeals court ruled,
while returning Tiffany's lawsuit to the trial court for further
action on a false-advertising claim. 
EBay's ads promoting Tiffany merchandise may be misleading
and in violation of federal law, the New York-based appeals
court said April 1. 
"The law prohibits an advertisement that implies that all
of the goods offered on a defendant's Web site are genuine when,
in fact, as here, a sizeable portion of them are not," a three-
judge panel wrote. 
The ruling may force EBay to change its advertising policy
to include disclaimers that some trademark goods, like Tiffany
jewelry, may be counterfeit. The judges said they "rather doubt
that the consequences will be so dire" that advertising will be
deterred because sellers can't confirm the authenticity of goods
for sale as EBay maintained. 
Tiffany said in a statement that it is "very
disappointed" by the ruling and considering an appeal. 
"EBay knew that counterfeit merchandise was being sold on
its site -- and EBay took no effective steps to stop it,"
Tiffany Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Kowalski said in the
statement. "EBay deliberately misled consumers for profit, and
unfortunately the court has justified its actions." 
Tiffany, based in New York, and other retailers have said
online sales of fake brands of clothes, bags and jewelry cost
the industry about $30 billion a year. EBay, the most-visited
U.S. e-commerce site, said the ruling validates its "leading
efforts to fight counterfeiting." 
"We continue to support cooperation, rather than
litigation, as the best way to address these issues in
everyone's best interests," Michael R. Jacobson, general
counsel of the San Jose, California-based company, said in a
statement, predicting an EBay victory on the false-ad claim. 
The case is Tiffany v. EBay, 08-3947, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).

Boeing Ready With Tanker Bid, Has Trademark Application 
Boeing Co., whose quest to gain the U.S. Air Force's $35
billion air-tanker contract was set back with the extension of
the bidding deadline to July 9, already has a pending
application for a trademark for the aircraft. 
Chicago-based Boeing, which is presently the only known
bidder for the contract, applied to register "KC-767" as a
trademark in March 2006, according to the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. The mark is to be used for
aircraft, Boeing said in its application. 
According to the designations-systems.net Web site, the Air
Force approved the KC-767 in September 2002 for a Boeing tanker
based on its 767 aircraft. Boeing is the maker of the KC-135
tanker the Air Force first ordered in 1954, which the new tanker
is intended to replace. 
The Department of Defense said March 31 it was extending
the bidding deadline to July 9 if the European Aeronautic
Defence and Space Co. decides to submit a bid. Netherlands-based
EADS asked for an extension after partner Northrop Grumman Corp.
dropped out of the competition on March 8, saying the bidding
contest favored the Boeing aircraft. 
Knoll Settles 'Barcelona' Trademark Dispute with Alphaville 
Knoll Inc., a maker of office furniture, settled a
trademark dispute with Alphaville Design Inc., according to a
company statement. 
Alphaville, a furniture wholesaler based in Fremont,
California, sued Knoll in federal court in San Francisco in
November 2007, seeking a declaration it wasn't infringing the
"Barcelona" trademarks used for furniture designed by Mies van
der Rohe. 
The California company claimed Knoll's trademarks were
invalid. In settling the dispute, Alphaville and its owners
acknowledged the validity of the trademarks and Knoll's rights
to them. 
In return, East Greenville, Pennsylvania-based Knoll
granted Alphaville the right to sell similar products for a
limited amount of time, according to the statement. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel signed the dismissal
order on March 29. No damages, litigation costs or attorney fees
were awarded to either party, according to the order. 
The case is Alphaville Design Inc., v. Knoll Inc. 3:07-cv-
0569-MHP, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).

General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, said it will wind down its Hummer brand and is
offering rebates of as much as $6,000 to sell remaining sport-
utility vehicles. 
Jim Bunnell, GM's general director for dealer network
support, told retailers in conference call at 11:45 a.m. Detroit
time that they will get letters within days about ending their
franchises, Nick Richards, a company spokesman, said in an
interview. 
Shedding Hummer was part of GM's plan to pare its U.S.
brands to four from eight after bankruptcy. GM has sold one of
the four brands it explored selling. 
"Anyone who buys it needs cash to make it work," said Jim
Hall, principal of 2953 Analytics, a consulting firm in
Birmingham, Michigan. "That's why GM has been turning buyers
away left, right and center." 
GM is winding down Saturn after a planned sale to Penske
Automotive Group Inc. fell through in September. It reversed
plans to sell its European Opel unit to Canadian supplier Magna
International Inc. in November. Detroit-based GM sold Saab in
February only after two attempts to sell the Swedish carmaker
failed. Pontiac is also being closed.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
energy company, said it never deliberately underpaid royalties
on natural gas pumped on federal and American Indian land. 
The U.S. Justice Department yesterday announced that Exxon
agreed to pay $32.2 million to resolve violations of the False
Claims Act committed between March 1988 and November 1999. Mobil
Corp., which was acquired by Exxon in December 1999,
"systematically underreported" the value of gas extracted from
the leases and "knowingly" underpaid what it owed, the
department said in a statement. 
"We reject any accusation that the company deliberately
under-reported the value of the natural gas," David Eglinton, a
spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mailed
statement. "The settlement agreement in this case, signed by
the government, expressly denies any knowing under-reporting
with respect to royalty." 
Eglinton said the agreement was signed in 2008. The Justice
Department's statement didn't explain why it waited until now to
announce the settlement. 
The amount Exxon agreed to pay is equivalent to less than
one hour of the company's sales. 
The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Harold Wright
under the provisions of the federal whistleblower statute that
allows private citizens to file actions on behalf of the
government and share in any recovery. Because Wright is deceased,
his heirs will receive $975,000, the Justice Department said. 
Other energy companies that previously settled similar
cases with the government include Burlington Resources Inc.,
which is now part of ConocoPhillips, Chevron Corp. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, the department said. 
The dispute centered on whether the energy companies could
deduct costs such as pipeline fees from the value of the gas.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. has almost
doubled the number of its Tokyo commodity traders to meet demand
from utilities seeking to use coal-derivatives to hedge against
price swings, said a person with knowledge of the expansion. 
The second-biggest U.S. bank has increased the headcount to
around 10 in the last 18 months, in part to meet the needs of
utilities such as Chubu Electric Power Co. and J-Power, the
country&#8217;s biggest power wholesaler, said the person, who
declined to be named because the information is private. 
JPMorgan joins Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc in
boosting sales of swaps and other products to help Japanese
utilities mitigate risk from volatile fuel costs. J-Power&#8217;s
profit dropped by a third in fiscal 2008 and Chubu posted a loss
after benchmark Australian power-station coal prices rose to a
record in July then fell 61 percent five months later. 
&#8220;Utilities&#8217; hedging needs have grown rapidly over the past
few years as physical coal prices became more volatile,&#8221; said
Ken Hasegawa, the energy team manager at broker Newedge in Tokyo.
&#8220;The question is whether other power companies will follow
suit.&#8221; 
Mika Nemoto, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Securities Japan
Co., declined to comment. 
J-Power, officially known as Electric Power Development Co.,
hired Barclays commodities banker Toyohiko Kuroda last year to
bolster management of risks associated with coal procurement,
Masato Uchiyama, director of the utility&#8217;s energy business
division, said in an interview on April 6. 
Coal Swaps 
The utility, which buys 20 million metric tons of coal
annually, transacts coal swaps for part of that total to hedge
against price fluctuations, said Uchiyama, 54. 
Swaps allow utilities to pay a fixed price for coal while
another party, usually a bank, pays a floating price, based on
market benchmarks. If the benchmark goes up during the term of
the contract, the utility gets a payment from the bank, and if
it goes down, the utility pays. 
Nagoya-based Chubu Electric transacted 15 million tons
worth of over-the-counter coal swaps free on board at
Australia&#8217;s Newcastle port in the year ended March 31 after
forming an alliance with a unit of Electricite de France SA in
2007, said Yoshio Komura, director of Chubu&#8217;s trading unit. 
Japan&#8217;s third-biggest generator formed Chubu Energy Trading
Inc. in 2007 to procure the fuel for resale to other users in
Asia and trade derivatives, Komura said. 
Spot power-station coal prices at Newcastle, the world&#8217;s
largest export harbor for the fuel, retreated to an average
$71.71 a ton in 2009 from $129.02 the previous year as the
global economic recession eroded demand. Prices climbed to a
record $192.50 in July before plunging to $75.25 in Dec. 5, 2008.
Coal gained 14 cents to $94.98 a ton in the week ended April 3,
according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index. 
Japan, the world&#8217;s biggest power-station coal importer in
2009, ships in about 92 million tons annually. Australian
suppliers led by Xstrata Plc and Rio Tinto Plc account for more
than half while Indonesia, the second-biggest supplier, provides
about 20 percent, according to the finance ministry.

Ali Hedayat, co-head in the Americas
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s largest internal hedge fund, has
left the firm, the second senior departure from the unit in less
than a month, said three people familiar with the matter. 
Hedayat&#8217;s departure follows last month&#8217;s exit by Pierre
Henri Flamand, who ran the Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies
division from London. Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York, declined to comment. Hedayat, 35, who was promoted
to managing director in October 2006, also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, generates about 10 percent of its revenue from
proprietary trading, or bets with the firm&#8217;s own money, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar has said. Goldman Sachs Principal
Strategies, a unit within the firm&#8217;s equities division,
rebounded from losses in 2008 to fuel the firm&#8217;s 7 percent gain
in equity revenue to $9.89 billion in 2009, according to the
company&#8217;s earnings report in January. 
Principal strategies seeks to profit from discrepancies in
relative values of financial instruments, convertible bonds and
&#8220;various types of volatility trading,&#8221; according to the
report. In early 2008, a group of traders from principal
strategies led by Raanan Agus and Kenneth Ebert created a $7
billion hedge fund called Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and
became part of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
Flamand, 39, is setting up his own hedge fund and a Goldman
Sachs executive in London said last month that the firm supports
Flamand&#8217;s plan. 
Hedayat, who graduated from McGill University in Montreal
in 1996 with a double major in finance and economics, started at
Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a financial analyst covering Latin
American markets. He joined the principal strategies group in
2000 and moved to the London office in 2002, before returning to
New York in 2007.

International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, is offering
financing to partners of Sun Microsystems Inc., the server-
computer maker acquired by IBM rival Oracle Corp. this year. 
As much as $500 million will be available for Sun partners
who switch to selling IBM systems -- integrated servers,
software and storage -- to their clients, Armonk, New York-based
IBM said today in a statement. 
IBM has won over some Sun resellers and is trying to get
more with the financing perk, said Bernie Spang, IBM&#8217;s director
of strategy for information-management software. The company had
sought to buy Sun last year, according to people familiar with
the matter. That bid dissolved after the companies disagreed on
price and terms. 
&#8220;The goal of this effort is to sweeten the pot,&#8221; Spang
said. 
Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. The company completed its purchase
of Sun in January for about $7.4 billion. IBM trails Microsoft
Corp. and Oracle in software sales. 
IBM also unveiled a new system that helps analyze data 20
times faster for industries such as finance and health care.
Last quarter, the company introduced its new Power7 systems,
which are tailored for specific projects. 
IBM rose 8 cents to $129.01 at 2:14 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had fallen 1.5 percent
this year before today.

positions were not a &#8216;bet against&#8217; our clients,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn wrote
in a letter introducing the firm&#8217;s annual report. 
Goldman Sachs has been criticized for its role in the
subprime mortgage-securities market and as a trading partner to
American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out by the
U.S. government. Harris Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate
reputations found that 60 percent of respondents gave Goldman
Sachs negative ratings for &#8220;ethical standards.&#8221; Only AIG,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac scored lower. 
Goldman Sachs posted $11.6 billion profit for fiscal 2007,
a record at the time, aided by bets that the subprime mortgage
market would decline even as clients continued to purchase the
securities. U.S. home prices have slumped 28 percent from their
all-time high in July 2006, spurring the worst recession since
the 1930s. 
&#8220;The firm did not generate enormous net revenues or
profits by betting against residential mortgage-related
products,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote. &#8220;Our relatively early
risk reduction resulted in our losing less money than we
otherwise would have when the residential housing market began
to deteriorate rapidly.&#8221; 
Taxpayer Aid 
The New York-based firm received $10 billion of taxpayer
aid in the credit crisis, which it repaid in June. That money
led politicians and pundits to blame Goldman Sachs for profiting
from taxpayers. Labor unions led protests calling for bonus
payments to be canceled, and a Rolling Stone magazine writer
last year labeled the firm a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity&#8221; and criticized it for selling
securities backed by subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs is grateful for the indispensible role
governments played and we recognize that our firm and our
shareholders benefitted from it,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
&#8220;It is impossible to know what would have happened to the
financial system absent concerted government action around the
world.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said AIG&#8217;s bailout in 2008 helped the bank
and every other financial institution, because the insurer&#8217;s
collapse would have been &#8220;extremely&#8221; disruptive to financial
markets, Blankfein said. 
The $182.3 billion bailout ensured that Goldman Sachs and
other counterparties were repaid in full. Much of the $12.9
billion Goldman Sachs received from the insurer&#8217;s rescue was
paid out to meet AIG-related &#8216;obligations,&#8221; the firm said. 
Goldman Sachs had &#8220;minimal&#8221; economic exposure to AIG
after it demanded collateral and insured against a default
through the credit default swaps market, Blankfein said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s railway fund
is betting on U.S. freight companies such as Union Pacific Corp.,
CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., following Warren Buffett&#8217;s
decision to take over Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. 
The 138 billion yen ($1.5 billion) JPM Global Railway Stock
Fund expects the companies to benefit from a move to carrying
goods by rail instead of roads to reduce fuel costs and
pollution, said Peter Kirkman, the fund&#8217;s lead portfolio manager.
Railroads burn less diesel than trucks for each ton of cargo
carried, giving operators a fuel-efficiency advantage. 
&#8220;Government policy will continue to move toward
environmental concerns,&#8221; Kirkman, who works for J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc., said in a telephone interview from
New York yesterday. &#8220;Moving freight by train rather than road
is highly advantageous.&#8221; 
Purchasing stakes in the U.S. rail companies has helped the
fund gain 11 percent in value since its January start and beat
the advances in Japan&#8217;s Topix Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. The fund, which has 19.8 percent of its holdings in the
U.S., was started Jan. 26 and is sold only in Japan. 
U.S. rail&#8217;s prospects spurred Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. last year to agree to spend $27 billion to buy 77.4 percent
of Burlington Northern it didn&#8217;t own. 
President Barack Obama earlier this year granted $8 billion
for 13 high-speed train corridors across the U.S., including a
portion to improve existing rail lines. 
Economic Rebound 
Union Pacific, the U.S. railroad with the biggest
locomotive fleet, is predicting growth in freight this year amid
more demand for transporting commodities as the U.S. economy
returned to growth. 
North American railroad volume, considered a leading
indicator for economic conditions, has gained 1.5 percent in the
year to March 27, according to the Association of American
Railroads, rebounding from a 16.2 percent slump last year. 
&#8220;There are only four major players and so it&#8217;s a fairly
small market,&#8221; Kirkman said. &#8220;Freight transport will continue
to grow.&#8221; 
Union Pacific fell 0.2 percent to $73.64 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. It has gained 15 percent
this year. CSX has gained 8.2 percent this year while Norfolk
Southern has advanced 9.9 percent. 
The fund doesn&#8217;t have a benchmark. Its gains compare with an
8.7 percent increase in the Topix index and a 9.5 percent
advance in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s head of
environmental commodities including carbon emissions, Gerrit
Nicholas, has left the firm, according to a bank official
briefed on the decision. 
Rich Sberlati, a vice president at the New York-based
securities firm, will become head of North American
environmental commodities, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced. Goldman
Sachs spokesman Melissa Daly declined to comment. Nicholas
couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. 
Banks including Goldman Sachs, London-based Barclays Plc
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. have been monitoring negotiations on
U.S. climate-change legislation, which stalled in the Senate,
dampening prospects for a &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; market for carbon-
dioxide emissions. The firms are seeking to play a key role in
any new nationwide system. 
Carbon allowances in a smaller trading program running in
10 Northeastern states fell 41 percent in 2009 and 7.4 percent
this year. The decline reflects, in part, uncertainty about the
outcome of climate-change talks, said Kedin Kilgore, named in
January to head Barclays Capital&#8217;s carbon-trading business. 
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough guidance out of D.C. to know if we
will have a confirmed trading program this year and whether a
federal program will fully supersede any regional program,&#8221;
Kilgore, head of U.S. emissions trading at Barclays unit, said
in an interview. 
The U.S. carbon market has the potential to surge to more
than $300 billion by 2020, according to Point Carbon, an Oslo-
based firm that analyzes environmental markets.

Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the
lender to the owners of Florida&#8217;s Sawgrass Marriott Resort,
asked a bankruptcy court for permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. 
Goldman yesterday asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn
in Jacksonville, Florida, to lift the automatic stay, a part of
the bankruptcy code that shields a company from creditors&#8217;
efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs Mortgage is a
division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Goldman, owed about $193 million, claims the company no
longer has a stake in the property and can&#8217;t restructure its
debts. 
&#8220;The resort property that is the subject of this
bankruptcy is worth less than the amount of the debt, and there
is clearly no equity in the property,&#8221; lawyers for the lender
said in court papers. 
RQB Resort LP, which filed bankruptcy March 1 to stop a
prior foreclosure action by Goldman, owns the 65-acre resort in
Ponte Vedra Beach that is home to the TPC Sawgrass golf club
where the U.S. PGA Tour&#8217;s Players Championship is held, court
papers show. Affiliate RQB Development also sought protection. 
In July 2006, Goldman helped finance RQB Resort and RQB
Development&#8217;s $220.5 million purchase of the property, court
papers show. RQB representatives met Goldman in March 2009 and
said that they might have &#8220;liquidity issues&#8221; by August. 
Negotiation Effort 
In June, the owners hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP to
broker a solution with Goldman. After almost three months of
negotiating, the owners believed that Perella had fashioned an
agreement on a restructuring except for one issue, according to
court documents. In October, Goldman told the owners it intended
to foreclose, the resort owner said. 
&#8220;When asked in early November why the restructuring was no
longer an alternative, Goldman Sachs stated that its management
had changed its mind and preferred to own the resort,&#8221; RQB said
in court papers. 
RQB Resort is the exclusive partner to the PGA Tour&#8217;s
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, known as TPC Sawgrass,
court papers show. The 508-room hotel resort has rights to
85 percent of the starting times each day to the Players Stadium
Course through 2089. 
Tiger Woods made his Feb. 19 apology for his marital
infidelity at the TPC Sawgrass golf club. 
The course was ranked ninth on Golf Digest&#8217;s list of
America&#8217;s 100 Greatest Public Courses for 2009-2010. The TPC
Sawgrass is known for its 17th hole, where World Golf Hall of
Fame architect Peter Dye placed the green on an island in a
small lake. 
The Masters Tournament started today, with Phil Mickelson,
Lee Westwood, Yong-Eun Yang, and 60-year-old Tom Watson tied for
the early lead at 5-under par. Woods, the No. 1 golfer in the
Official World Ranking, is 1-under par through the first 6
holes. 
The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville).

GSW Immobilien AG, a German property
company owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cerberus Capital
Management LP, aims to raise about 140 million euros ($187
million) in an initial public offering. 
The Berlin-based joint venture will offer as much as 15
percent on top of the base amount, according to terms of the
deal obtained by Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank
AG are managing the sale, which is scheduled for the second
quarter, as joint global coordinators. 
The company aims for a free float of at least 49.9 percent
of the stock after the IPO in a primary and secondary share
sale. The amount to be raised from the secondary offering has
yet to be confirmed, according to the term sheet. 
The offering comes after German companies raised 1.7
billion euros from IPOs in March, the biggest amount since July
2007, Bloomberg data show. Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, the
country&#8217;s largest cable company, sold 759 million euros of stock
and chemicals distributor Brenntag AG raised 748 million euros. 
GSW was sold by the city of Berlin to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Whitehall Funds unit and Cerberus, the U.S. investment fund, for
almost 2 billion euros in 2004. 
The company&#8217;s 49,700 properties have space of about 3.1
million square meters (33.4 million square feet) and were valued
at about 2.6 billion euros at the end of last year, according to
a statement today. GSW also manages another 17,000 homes.

Coca-Cola Co. has started testing a
reduced-sugar soft drink in Germany, preparing a second attack
on Bionade GmbH, the organic drinks maker that has rejected
takeover bids from the world&#8217;s largest beverage producer. 
Coca-Cola has been testing consumer reaction to a naturally
fruit-flavored soft drink called Tumult since February in about
40 Alex bar-restaurants owned by British pub operator Mitchells
 Butlers Plc. A 0.33-liter bottle of Tumult costs 2.80 euros
($3.72), 20 cents more than a bottle of Fanta or Coke. 
Tumult is Coca-Cola&#8217;s second swipe at Bionade, which with a
6 percent market share is Germany&#8217;s third-largest non-cola soft
drink brand behind Coke&#8217;s Fanta and Sprite. Coca-Cola in 2008
introduced Spirit of Georgia, with &#8220;less sugar and carbonic
acid&#8221; than rival sodas, according to its Web site. 
&#8220;Tumult is addressing adult consumers, and we will examine
the drink&#8217;s acceptance in the coming months,&#8221; said Kristina
Brehm, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in Germany. The drink hasn&#8217;t
been officially announced, she said. 
Coca-Cola has made approaches to buy Bionade, according to
the company&#8217;s co-owner and Chief Executive Officer Peter
Kowalsky. The Atlanta-based beverage producer made an offer
worth &#8220;hundreds of millions,&#8221; he said in an interview in 2007.
Dr. August Oetker KG, the family company that owns Germany&#8217;s
largest brewery, bought a majority stake in Bionade last year. 
Brehm declined to comment about offers for Bionade. 
Spirit of Georgia 
Spirit of Georgia had less than 1 percent market share last
year in the German non-cola soft drinks market, which is worth
about 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to data
provided by the country&#8217;s industry group for non-alcoholic
beverages. 
&#8220;Organic soft drinks have shown an above-average growth
pace in the past and I expect the segment to continue growing in
the future,&#8221; Detlef Gross, head of the industry group, said. 
Bionade&#8217;s drinks are made through a fermentation process
that generates gluconic acid, which is found naturally in honey
and fruit, rather than alcohol, according to the company&#8217;s Web
site. Bionade says it uses only natural ingredients, and its
drinks carry the seal of the European Union&#8217;s organic food
control board. 
Bionade is being offered in five different flavors while
Spirit of Georgia is available in three. Tumult, which uses some
fermented ingredients, is currently being sold in a &#8220;fruity&#8221;
and a &#8220;bittersweet&#8221; variety. 
Ostheim, Germany-based Bionade, which was founded in 1985
and had forecast turnover of as many as 230 million bottles in
2009, isn&#8217;t concerned about the potential new competitor,
Kowalsky said. None of the more than 30 rival products on the
German market has lowered its own market share, he added. 
Bionade, which generates the major part of revenue in its
domestic market, aims to accelerate international expansion, the
executive said. In neighboring Austria, the beverage is being
served in bars and restaurants and is sold in organic grocery
stores. The company is currently hiring vendors in what Kowalsky
calls &#8220;trendsetter cities&#8221; including Barcelona and San
Francisco, where Bionade is available in more than 100 bars.

&#8220;isn&#8217;t an insurer,&#8221; Bernheim was also cited as saying.
Bernheim hasn&#8217;t decided whether to accept an offer to become
honorary chairman because it doesn&#8217;t involve having a seat on
the board, according to the report. 
The new board will be voted in at the insurer&#8217;s annual

Generali, Italy&#8217;s largest insurer.

China&#8217;s March trade deficit is
temporary and the pressure for the yuan to gain remains intact,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;The weak exports in March were likely due to the Lunar
New Year effects as exporters suspend production for an extended
period after the holiday,&#8221; wrote Hong Kong-based analysts Song
Yu and Helen Qiao in a report on April 10. &#8220;Given the strong
underlying exports growth and rising overheating pressures, we
believe a modest yuan revaluation is still on the agenda.&#8221; 
China posted its first trade deficit in six years in March,
even as the yuan remained pegged to the dollar. Exports gained
24 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 46 percent in
February. Imports jumped 66 percent last month from the same
period last year, compared to a 45 percent increase in February.
This resulted in $7.24 billion shortfall, versus the median
forecast for a $390 million deficit in a Bloomberg News survey. 
China&#8217;s yuan traded at 6.8248 per dollar as of 9:33 a.m. in
Shanghai versus 6.8239 on April 9, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. The central bank has kept the
currency around 6.83 since July 2008. 
Goldman on April 1 raised its three- and six-month
projections for the yuan to reflect expectations the currency
will be allowed to strengthen this quarter. It predicted the
yuan will appreciate to 6.74 per dollar by the end of June and
6.66 by the end of September. 
Policy makers will probably allow appreciation to resume by
widening the currency&#8217;s trading band versus the dollar to 1
percent, from 0.5 percent, and commencing a &#8220;downward crawl&#8221;
of the central bank&#8217;s reference rate, Goldman said on April 1.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, fell the most in three weeks in
New York trading after a newsletter report that Simon Property
Group Inc. may abandon a takeover bid for its smaller rival. 
Simon, based in Indianapolis, is unlikely to move ahead
with its buyout offer because of antitrust concerns, the REIT
Newshound reported last night, citing sources it didn&#8217;t
identify. Simon has concluded that an attorney for Chicago-based
General Growth who deals with antitrust issues wasn&#8217;t dealing in
&#8220;good faith,&#8221; the newsletter said, citing one of the sources. 
Les Morris, a spokesman for Simon Property, declined to
comment. David Keating, a General Growth spokesman, didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. 
General Growth fell 3.6 percent to $16.13 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest drop since March 23. The
shares have jumped 72 percent since Feb. 15, the day before
Simon made public a $10 billion offer to buy the company out of
bankruptcy. General Growth dismissed the bid as too low and
instead plans to exit bankruptcy with financing from a group led
by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
&#8220;GGP shares were priced based on some sort of topping from
Simon,&#8221; said Benjamin Yang, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette 
Woods in San Francisco. &#8220;Based on this news, it seems less
likely that Simon will come back with an offer higher than the
$15-a-share proposal from Brookfield.&#8221; 
General Growth filed the biggest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history almost a year ago after amassing $27 billion in
debt making acquisitions. Simon&#8217;s bid would have given equity
investors about $9 a share and paid unsecured creditors in full. 
Simon has been preparing a new offer for General Growth, a
person with knowledge of the plan told Bloomberg News last
month.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, is courting
endowment heads to join its asset-management group, according to
three people with knowledge of the search. 
The company started approaching chief investment officers
at endowments, as well as money managers that oversee such
assets, late last year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the search isn&#8217;t public. The bank is looking
to expand its portfolio-solutions team of 50 employees, which
invests on behalf of clients and works on asset allocation,
portfolio construction and manager selection, said Andrea
Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company. 
&#8220;When they hire a CIO, not only can they then sell their
product better, but that gives them internal knowledge,&#8221;
Charles Skorina, whose headhunting firm Charles A. Skorina  Co.
in San Francisco advises endowments, said in an interview last
week. &#8220;This guy comes into Goldman and the Goldman guys say,
&#8216;OK, what kind of products does an endowment need and how should
we structure our products so we can go and sell a complete
set?&#8217;&#8221; 
Pacific Investment Management Co. and Perella Weinberg
Partners have added or expanded asset-management services for
endowments as they recover from record losses during the
financial crisis. U.S. institutions will outsource more than
half a trillion dollars in investments by the end of 2012,
according to estimates by consultant Casey Quirk  Associates
LLC. 
Candidate Search 
The portfolio-solutions group is part of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, catering to endowments, foundations, public
and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family
offices and insurance firms, Raphael said. Chris Kojima and
Charles Baillie, partners at the firm, run the group. The asset-
management unit also serves those clients through its fund-of-
funds group, which invests about $80 billion in outside firms. 
The firm approached candidates through headhunter Charles
Sterling Group LLC in Boston, said two of the people, who had
been contacted and turned down the job. The bank has talked with
candidates from pension funds, endowments and other asset
managers, according to another person familiar with the search.
Raphael declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s recruiting efforts. 
U.S. institutions will probably outsource $510 billion in
investments by the end of 2012, more than double the $195
billion as of the most recent data at the end of 2008, according
to Casey Quirk of Darien, Connecticut. Investors most likely to
use outsourcing services are those with $250 million to $750
million in assets, which struggle to find talent and can&#8217;t
access the best investment strategies, the company said. 
Yale&#8217;s Swensen 
It costs about $2 million to $3 million a year to maintain
an investment office with five employees, compared with a fee of
50 basis points on assets under management in a typical
outsourced agreement, Skorina said. 
Endowments outperformed market indexes for years by
following a style pioneered by David Swensen, Yale University&#8217;s
investment chief. The strategy relies on so-called alternative
assets including commodities, real estate and private equity to
outperform market indexes. Some of those hard-to-sell holdings
fell more than public stocks and bonds in the year ending June
2009, leaving endowments with losses. 
&#8220;Investing in alternatives and alternatives being a much
bigger allocation of portfolios has been a big driver in the
interest in outsourcing,&#8221; said Kevin Quirk, a partner at Casey
Quirk. Losses from some alternative investments &#8220;brought into
question whether or not these things are sustainable for the
long term,&#8221; he said. 
Rate Swaps 
Top endowments used outsourcing firms in the 1960s and
1970s, which were &#8220;generally disasters,&#8221; said Josh Lerner, a
Harvard Business School professor who wrote a case study on
Yale&#8217;s endowment. The New Haven, Connecticut school, which
helped to found Endowment Management and Research Corp. in
Boston, fired the manager in 1979 after the institution&#8217;s fund
had dropped 46 percent since 1969 on an inflation-adjusted
basis, according to Lerner&#8217;s research. 
&#8220;The intermediaries tended to take a very short-run view
or else engaged in activities that were beneficial for their own
account trading or client development but were detrimental to
the long-run returns of their university clients,&#8221; Lerner said
in an e-mail. 
Forst 
For more than 20 years, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc. sold swaps as a way for schools, towns and
nonprofit organizations to reduce interest costs and protect
against rising payments on variable-rate debt. In 2008, the
value of Harvard&#8217;s interest-rate swaps tumbled and its endowment
plunged, forcing the school to raise $2.5 billion in bonds that
December as it was squeezed for collateral. 
Edward Forst, who rejoined Goldman Sachs in September after
11 months helping to oversee finances at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, became co-head of the firm&#8217;s
investment-management division at the end of February with Tim
O&#8217;Neill. Before he left for Harvard, Forst had spent less than a
year helping to run Goldman&#8217;s investment-management unit. 
Asset management, which oversees funds for institutions and
wealthy individuals, is a smaller department at Goldman Sachs
than investment banking and trading. The division&#8217;s 2009 revenue
of $3.97 billion accounted for 8.8 percent of the firm&#8217;s sales.
Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from 2008 as incentive and
management fees declined. Assets under management climbed 12
percent from a year earlier to $871 billion as rising markets
more than offset fund withdrawals. 
Pimco Additions 
The division doubled its third-party distribution sales
force last year and &#8220;significantly&#8221; increased its coverage of
institutional and private wealth accounts, according to the
firm&#8217;s annual letter to shareholders April 7. The unit serves
2,000 institutional clients and more than 25,000 private wealth
accounts. 
Pimco, led by Mohamed El-Erian, the former Harvard fund
chief, last month hired Gregory Hazlett as head of equity
strategies and Andrew Hoffmann to oversee real-asset
investments. They report to Mark Taborsky, an executive vice
president at the firm and former Harvard endowment manager.
Taborsky leads a fund-of-funds unit, based on the alternative-
investing model of endowments, targeting school funds and other
clients. 
Campus Recruits 
Other asset managers have recruited chief investment
officers from schools. Perella Weinberg in New York hired
Christopher Bittman, former CIO of the University of Colorado
Foundation, in July to lead a unit that manages money for
endowments. David Russ, a former manager of Dartmouth College&#8217;s
fund, was hired in June at Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG
as a chief investment strategist in asset management. 
A number of higher-education money managers have left
academia to start their own firms. They include Jack Meyer, who
stepped down from his Harvard Management Co. chief executive
officer post in 2005 to form Convexity Capital Management LP in
Boston with $6.3 billion from clients, and ex-Stanford
Management Co. head Michael McCaffery, who raised $7 billion
from investors including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen
to start Makena Capital Management LLC in 2006. 
University funds lost an average of 19 percent in the year
ending June 2009, according to the National Association of
College and University Business Officers, based in Washington,
and Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut. It was the biggest annual
loss in the 35 years for which records have been kept. 
Endowment Turnover 
With tumbling endowments has come turnover in the ranks of
managers who oversee the funds. Dartmouth College in Hanover,
New Hampshire, Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts,
and New York University in Manhattan didn&#8217;t immediately fill CIO
positions as they reviewed spending. Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Connecticut, fired CIO Thomas Kannam in October. 
James Walsh of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York,
announced plans in February to step down at the end of the
academic year. Christopher Brightman resigned last month from
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Stanford
University&#8217;s endowment, the third-richest among U.S. colleges,
is searching for a chief investment officer after leaving the
post vacant for more than two years.

Microsoft Corp. introduced a line
of mobile phones today that are focused on social-networking
features to win over teens and young adults who have flocked to
devices from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. 
Called Kin One and Kin Two, the phones will be made by
Sharp Corp. and sold in the U.S. by Verizon Wireless starting in
May, Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft President Robbie
Bach, who oversees the mobile-phone unit, demonstrated the
phones today at an event in San Francisco. 
The phones represent a new strategy for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, which previously had only developed
software for phone manufacturers, rather than getting deeply
into hardware design itself. The move echoes Google&#8217;s decision
to sell the Nexus One handset in addition to offering phone
makers its Android operating system. 
&#8220;We said, &#8216;Look, there&#8217;s a segment here that we can really
go after deeply,&#8221; Bach said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;And once you decide to go deep, you
can&#8217;t go part way and say we&#8217;ll do the software and then we&#8217;ll
hand it off to somebody else. You have to really be involved in
the whole process.&#8221; 
The Kin phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain
and the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. 
Microsoft may develop phone hardware for other segments of
the market in the future, said Todd Peters, vice president in
the company&#8217;s mobile communications marketing group. 
Partners or Competitors 
The risk in the strategy is that phone makers who view
Microsoft and Google as partners see these moves as competition,
making them less likely to want to use Microsoft&#8217;s or Google&#8217;s
operating systems, ABI Research analyst Kevin Burden said. Bach
said in January that it would be &#8220;very, very difficult&#8221; for
Google to sell its own phone while keeping manufacturers and
carriers for other Android handsets happy. 
Bach said Microsoft&#8217;s approach is different than Google&#8217;s,
because Google sells the Nexus One itself, while Microsoft is
relying on Verizon and Vodafone. 
&#8220;They can get away with it because they&#8217;re not selling it
themselves,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s Burden said of Microsoft. &#8220;It looks really
different because they didn&#8217;t set up their own Web site store
for it like Google.&#8221; 
Microsoft fell 2 cents to $30.32 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares are little changed this year. 
Social-Networking Sites 
The Kin phones include cameras, touch screens and slide-out
keyboards for text messaging. The phone takes updates from
social-networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace
and displays them in one place on the phone&#8217;s main screen,
called the Kin Loop. Users can drag videos, photos, status
updates, text messages and Web sites to one spot on the phone
and then share the whole package of content with friends. 
Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to disclose
pricing for the phones. 
Facing market share declines, Microsoft also is releasing a
new version of its phone operating system for handset
manufacturers to use later this year. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows dropped to a 7.9 percent share of the
worldwide smartphone-software market in the fourth quarter from
12.5 percent a year earlier, while the iPhone and Android posted
gains, according to ABI Research. 
The iPhone took 16.6 percent of the market in the fourth
quarter, up from 10.8 percent the previous year, Oyster Bay, New
York-based ABI said. Android climbed to 8.5 percent from 1.7
percent. 
Targeting Young Consumers 
Verizon Wireless, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and
U.K.-based Vodafone are targeting young people who will buy
plans for texting and Web access, seeking to expand their
fastest-growing revenue stream. Sales of data plans at Verizon
Wireless rose 46 percent in the fourth quarter, contributing
almost a third of the company&#8217;s wireless-service revenue. 
Microsoft and Verizon Wireless kept the Kin&#8217;s target
demographic group in mind at today&#8217;s event, held at a San
Francisco club called Mighty. A rusty truck stood outside
selling sugar waffles. Inside, baristas hired from a local cafe
served up Ethiopian and Brazilian coffee while photos of denim-
and flannel-clad young people flashed on screens around the
room. 
&#8220;This is an age group Microsoft has to court,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s
Burden said. &#8220;They&#8217;re kind of losing this group to Apple and
Google, and what they don&#8217;t want is to have all these late teens
and early 20-somethings not growing up Microsoft.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, who took over from John Mack in January,
said he&#8217;s not content with results for last year, when the
company reported its first per-share annual loss. 
&#8220;We are not satisfied with our performance,&#8221; Gorman said
today in a letter to shareholders. &#8220;Our goal, as we move
forward, is to rank in the top three in the key businesses in
which we operate.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
trailed rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in trading
revenue last year. Gorman&#8217;s New York-based firm has hired more
than 350 employees as part of a &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of its sales
and trading business, he said in the letter. 
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the firm to post
adjusted earnings of $2.85 a share in 2010, according to the
average of 27 estimates. That would be the largest profit since
2006. 
Gorman, 51, said &#8220;headwinds&#8221; related to the firm&#8217;s
tightening debt spreads are &#8220;largely behind us.&#8221; Those charges
reduced the firm&#8217;s revenue last year by $5.5 billion and lowered
earnings per share by $2.84, according to the letter. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith
Barney wealth-management unit &#8220;is going to play an increasingly
important role in our growth and profitability,&#8221; Gorman said.
Morgan Stanley purchased a controlling stake in the venture last
year, giving it about 18,000 financial advisers and $1.56
trillion in client assets as of Dec. 31. 
TARP Program 
There is &#8220;no question&#8221; that Morgan Stanley and the
financial industry benefited from the Treasury Department&#8217;s
Troubled Asset Relief Program and other government efforts to
stabilize markets, Gorman said. 
He also called on the industry to &#8220;work as partners with
regulators and legislators&#8221; in shaping regulatory reform, and
declared his support for a systemic-risk regulator with the
ability to prevent &#8220;excessive&#8221; risk taking. 
&#8220;In the wake of the financial crisis, we believe that
fundamental regulatory reform is critical for our industry--and
the global capital markets,&#8221; Gorman wrote. &#8220;We are committed
to working cooperatively with policy makers and to playing a
constructive role in building a new regulatory framework.&#8221;

The German auction for mobile-
phone frequencies, which started today, is the largest in a
slew of such sales in Europe and may determine how much
operators are willing to pay for new spectrum. 
The new frequencies will alleviate pressure on networks as
companies including Apple Inc. unveil data-hungry devices such
as the iPad tablet computer and users increasingly download
videos and music on mobile phones. Deutsche Telekom AG,
Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and Royal KPN NV are
participating in the auction. 
The phone companies will spend as much as 6 billion euros
($8.1 billion) combined, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service estimates,
while Commerzbank AG predicts a total investment of 7.5 billion
euros. At the last German auction in 2000, the sale of third-
generation licenses fetched 99.4 billion deutsche marks, or
about 50 billion euros. 
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to be anywhere near
those crazy amounts that we saw in 2000,&#8221; CreditSights analyst
Mark Chapman said in a phone interview today. &#8220;With 10 more
years of maturity, the industry is much more realistic.&#8221; 
In the first round, the four companies&#8217; highest bids
totaled 94.5 million euros, with Telefonica&#8217;s O2 emerging as
the highest bidder, exceeding minimum bids allowed by three
times in two instances, and by 80 percent in six instances. 
Where Deutsche Telekom was the highest bidder it exceeded
the minimum bid allowed by 0.8 percent or by nothing, Vodafone
exceeded minimum allowed bids by 0.4 percent or by nothing, and
KPN&#8217;s E-Plus submitted bids that were at most 0.8 percent
higher than the minimum. In the second round, the highest bids
totaled 114.9 million euros. 
Auction Schedules 
The Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and France are
expected to hold auctions this year, according to Chapman. The
U.K. is expected to auction frequencies next year, while Spain,
Italy and Portugal have yet to say when their auctions will
take place. 
Deutsche Telekom, Europe&#8217;s largest telephone company,
Vodafone, Telefonica&#8217;s O2 and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus are the four network
operators in Germany. They have a combined 108.5 million
subscribers as some of the 82 million people living in the
country have more than one mobile-phone subscription. 
Pressure on Networks 
&#8220;There&#8217;s already a situation in the U.S. where it&#8217;s
getting more difficult for smartphones to access the Internet,
especially in San Francisco and Manhattan,&#8221; said Matthias
Kurth, president of the German federal network agency, in
Mainz, Germany, at an April 8 briefing on the auction. &#8220;We
want to avert such a development here.&#8221; 
In December, the wireless division of ATT Inc., the
biggest U.S. phone company, said 1 percent of smartphone
customers accounted for 20 percent of the data drain on its
network, while its top 3 percent were using 40 percent. 
In the U.S., Federal Communications Chairman Julius
Genachowski said in February that the country faces a &#8220;looming
spectrum crunch&#8221; and said he wants to auction airwaves held by
television stations to make room for more mobile Internet use. 
The most coveted frequencies in Germany are in the 800
megahertz band, previously used to broadcast TV and dubbed the
&#8220;digital dividend.&#8221; These have better indoor coverage and
geographical reach than higher frequencies, making it cheaper
to build networks that facilitate broadband coverage in rural
areas. 
Partnership Possibilities 
Under the auction terms, only three of the four German
operators will be able to secure enough spectrum in the 800 MHz
band. Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, which have a combined
market share of 70 percent, may gain the biggest slice of the
frequency. 
In the first round of bids, O2 submitted two bids of 7.5
million euros for two of the paired frequencies in the 800 MHz
band, or three times the minimum 2.5 million euros allowed. In
the second round, E-Plus overtook Telefonica as the highest
bidder for the two pairs of frequencies, at 8.6 million euros. 
Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s highest bid for another two 800 MHz
frequency pairs was 2.52 million euros each, or 20,000 euros
above the minimum allowed, and Vodafone bid 2.51 million euros
for the last pair. Both companies&#8217; bids remained unchallenged
in the second round. 
Following the auction, Telefonica&#8217;s O2 and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus
may seek a partnership either with each other, or O2 with
Vodafone, if they don&#8217;t get the spectrum they need on their
own, analysts have said. 
Bernstein Research analyst Robin Bienenstock said in a
note on March 17 that E-Plus may need to strike a network-
sharing deal in Germany after the auction to limit operating
expenses. 
Network Terms 
KPN Chief Executive Officer Ad Scheepbouwer has said he
remains open to any form of partnership. Auction rules prohibit
cooperation during the auction, meaning all bidders are on
their own until the bidding is over. 
The 800 MHz frequencies come with specific terms attached.
The winners commit to building a network to cover at least 90
percent of the population in rural towns and districts,
starting with areas with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, before
they can use these frequencies in more densely populated areas. 
The costs associated with these terms may prompt companies
to spend on other frequencies, Kurth said. In total, 41
frequency blocks are for sale. 
The operators are free to choose which technology they
wish to employ. Last time around, frequencies were allocated to
GSM or UMTS technologies. 
&#8216;Game of Chicken&#8217; 
All the operators in Germany have had to name which
frequencies they intend to bid on, and, according to Kurth, the
demand is for &#8220;significantly more&#8221; than is available. 
The auction started today at 1 pm. From tomorrow, it will
take place from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day, with a minimum of
four rounds of bidding per day at 90 minutes per round. The
result of each round, with the name of the highest bidder for
each frequency block, will be published on the network agency&#8217;s
Web site. The auction ends when no higher bids are submitted
for any of the frequencies. 
&#8220;The companies have many rounds to go through, they don&#8217;t
really need to decide right now,&#8221; CreditSights&#8217; Chapman said.
&#8220;They will probably see how the bids unfold. It&#8217;s definitely a
game of chicken.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Japan
Chairman Akio Asuke, a former veteran banker at Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., will step down on June 30. 
Asuke, 67, will become an adviser starting July 1, the U.S.
bank said in a statement distributed at the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today. He joined Goldman Sachs after resigning as deputy
president at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in June 2002, it said. 
Asuke&#8217;s departure comes three months after Sumitomo Mitsui
asked Goldman Sachs to convert its preferred shares to an equity
stake. The New York-based firm in 2003 bought 150.3 billion yen
($1.6 billion) of the Sumitomo Mitsui securities to help bolster
capital eroded by losses on holdings and bad loans. 
Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t decided who will succeed Asuke or if
the bank will retain the position, said Hiroko Matsumoto, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs.

Nashville, home of country-music
stars such as Taylor Swift and the Grand Ole Opry, will boost
city-backed debt by almost 40 percent to borrow $633 million for
a new convention center three times the size of the Tennessee
municipality&#8217;s current one. 
Bonds to be sold tomorrow by Nashville and Davidson
County&#8217;s Convention Center Authority through investment banks
led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pledge general-fund revenue if
hotel, airport and rental-car taxes and use of the Music City
Center aren&#8217;t enough to repay investors. The tourism revenue
won&#8217;t be adequate, said Councilwoman Emily Evans, a former
municipal bond underwriter. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a riverboat gamble with very little upside,&#8221; said
Evans, who worked for 15 years at J.C. Bradford  Co., the
Nashville firm acquired by Paine Webber in 2000. &#8220;It just
doesn&#8217;t seem like a good bet to me.&#8221; 
Nashville, the home of the Country Music Hall of Fame,
hopes to enhance tourism by creating retail and parking areas,
tripling exhibit space to 350,000 square feet and adding 64,000
square feet of ballrooms, according to the preliminary official
statement. 
The $415 million Music City Center will enable the city to
compete for larger meetings, add 1,524 jobs and generate almost
$135 million of new annual spending by 2017, according to a
study by HVS Convention, Sports  Entertainment in Chicago on
Jan. 6. The facility is forecast to yield almost $12 million in
new tax revenue beyond tourism levies dedicated to the $40
million-a-year of debt service, said consulting firm HVS. 
Attendance Down 
With convention center attendance down nationwide -- a 30
percent decline in Las Vegas and 28 percent in Orlando, Florida,
two of the largest convention markets in the U.S. -- Nashville&#8217;s
taxpayers may wind up paying part of the cost if use of the new
center falls short, said Heywood Sanders, professor of public
administration at the University of Texas in San Antonio, who
has studied convention centers. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a leap of faith,&#8221; said Sanders, who&#8217;s writing
a book on convention center financing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty large
chunk of debt.&#8221; 
The city is selling in four parts, with about $605 million
as taxable Build America Bonds, which come with a 35 percent
subsidy from the U.S. government under economic stimulus
legislation passed last year by Congress. 
The average yield on Build America securities fell 6 basis
points to a three-week low of 6.17 percent yesterday, according
to the Wells Fargo Build America Bond Index. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. 
Tourism Boost 
A larger convention center is forecast to increase hotel
room-tax receipts for the city to $30.5 million in 2014 from
just over $28 million in 2009, according to a feasibility study
released by HVS on March 26. By 2019, it&#8217;s estimated to exceed
$40 million a year. At the same time the new borrowings will
increase debt backed by the city&#8217;s general fund by 39.6 percent
to $2.23 billion. 
&#8220;We have an opportunity to take visitor taxes and fees,
and invest them in a way that creates jobs and grows our local
economy,&#8221; Mayor Karl Dean said in a Jan. 6 statement. 
A new facility was needed to attract conventions, said
Marty Dickens, chairman of the convention center authority, in a
phone interview. The city is using the same financial model it
employed for the existing site in 1987, which is now too small
to compete in luring events, he said. 
&#8216;Untested&#8217; Projections 
Fitch Ratings, which ranks the bonds being sold at A+, in
evaluating the convention center debt, lowered the city&#8217;s
general obligation grade by one rung on April 6 to AA-, its
fourth-highest level, citing the &#8220;potential additional fiscal
strains of the debt-financed convention center upon an already
pressured general fund,&#8221; the company said. Projections on two
tourism taxes &#8220;are untested&#8221; and &#8220;heavily dependent upon
increased tourism&#8221; at the convention center, Fitch said. 
&#8220;We realized the city feels it will be vital to increasing
the desirability of downtown,&#8221; said Amy Laskey, an analyst at
Fitch, in a phone interview. &#8220;The city already operated on a
thinly balanced budget, so the debt does increase the risk for
the general fund.&#8221; 
The new bond issue is structured with reserves and revenue
projections that exceed what is needed to cover payments to
investors to protect the city&#8217;s general fund, said Dickens. 
&#8220;The convention market would have to seriously go to
pieces before we would need general fund dollars,&#8221; Dickens
said. &#8220;A lot of conventions like to come here because of our
reputation as a music city.&#8221; 
Moody&#8217;s Rating 
The biggest portion of the obligations is rated Aa3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the
fourth- and sixth-highest rankings, respectively. Ten-year, AAA
rated municipal bonds traded at yields of 3.28 percent, down 2
basis points from a nine-month high today. 
Richard Riebeling, the city&#8217;s director of finance, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. Wayne Placide, the city&#8217;s
financial adviser with First Southwest Co. in Dallas, referred a
request for comment to Jeff Scruggs, a managing director with
Goldman Sachs. The firm&#8217;s spokesman, Michael DuVally, said
Scruggs couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show further losses in its
prime and subprime mortgage portfolios when it reports first-
quarter earnings, according to analyst Dick Bove. 
&#8220;Losses have not been curtailed,&#8221; Bove, vice president of
Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, said in a Bloomberg
Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;In the commercial
industrial loan portfolio and in the consumer portfolio, we
should start to see some improvement.&#8221; 
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon faces
challenges with low money-lending rates and increasing
regulation, said Bove, who has &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-
based bank. 
&#8220;His margins are going to be stressed because he needs
higher interest rates,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;His loan volume is likely
to be lower, and they&#8217;re going to be issues with his noninterest
income because of this new Regulation E and the credit-card bill
-- both of which control what he can charge for different
products that he signs.&#8221; 
Analysts expect JPMorgan&#8217;s net income declined from the end
of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending, with
mortgage writedowns as high as $2.5 billion per quarter during
2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009, according to
company data. Bove forecast earnings of 62 cents a share,
compared with the 64-cent average of his and 20 other analysts&#8217;
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. 
The shares of JPMorgan fell 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$46.02 at 3:31 p.m. in New York. 
Bove, who has been an analyst since 1965, recommended
selling Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. stock four months before
it collapsed, helping investors avoid a 65 percent plunge in the
shares before he raised them to &#8220;buy&#8221; on Aug. 21, 2008. Lehman
filed the world&#8217;s largest bankruptcy three weeks later.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s board added
Cynthia Telles, who is head of a California hospital clinic and
served with GM Chairman Ed Whitacre as a director of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. 
Telles, 57, is on the medical school faculty at the
University of California at Los Angeles and is director of
UCLA&#8217;s Neuropsychiatric Institute Spanish-Speaking Psychosocial
Clinic, GM said today in a statement. The addition gives the
Detroit-based automaker 13 board members. 
&#8220;She&#8217;s got a good reputation,&#8221; said Harley Shaiken, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley who
specializes in labor issues. &#8220;She does bring a diverse
perspective to the board. It appears to be a positive step.&#8221; 
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, reorganized in a
government-aided bankruptcy last year. Whitacre, 68, has led
the company&#8217;s board since GM&#8217;s July 10 exit from court
protection and took over as chief executive officer in December. 
The automaker expects to report &#8220;solid&#8221; first-quarter
operating results, Whitacre said yesterday in an e-mail to
employees. In a March 31 message to employees, he said he had
completed his overhaul of GM&#8217;s senior management. 
Telles in September joined Whitacre on the board of
Burlington Northern, the second-largest U.S. railroad by sales.
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy the
railroad in November and completed the purchase in February. 
Adding Telles as a director &#8220;ensures that the company will
continue to benefit from a diversity of perspectives and
experience,&#8221; GM said in its statement. She also is on the
boards of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals and
Americas United Bank, the automaker said. 
President Barack Obama appointed Telles as a member of the
Commission on Presidential Scholars last week. She was a city
commissioner in Los Angeles for 13 years. 
Telles holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Smith College in
Northampton, Massachusetts, and a doctorate in clinical
psychology from Boston University, GM said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
second-largest corporation, reduced Chief Executive Officer Rex
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation by 16 percent last year after the
company lost more than one-seventh of its market valuation. 
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation fell to $27.2 million in 2009 from
$32.2 million a year earlier, based on U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission rules. The information was disclosed today
by the Irving, Texas-based company in a regulatory filing. 
Tillerson, 58, was paid a salary of $2.06 million, a $2.4
million bonus and stock awards worth almost $17 million, the
filing showed. He also accrued $5.47 million from changes in the
value of his pension and deferred compensation, and $280,925 in
the form of personal security, life insurance and the use of
company-owned aircraft. 
Exxon shares fell 15 percent in 2009, the second
consecutive annual decline, as the recession squashed demand and
prices for petroleum-based fuels. Net income tumbled 57 percent
last year, the largest annual drop since Exxon Corp.&#8217;s 1999
acquisition of Mobil Corp. 
In his fifth year as CEO, Tillerson is spending almost $77
million a day to find untapped oil fields and build platforms to
exploit previous discoveries. In December, he signed a $29.2
billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc. to capture the Fort Worth,
Texas-based company&#8217;s gas-drilling expertise and extensive North
American prospects. 
Effective Jan. 1, Tillerson&#8217;s annual salary rose 7.3
percent to $2.21 million, the filing said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, sold its 9.43 percent stake in Norwegian natural-
gas pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas Infrastructure AS. 
Exxon Mobil will retain its current capacity rights to
transport gas through the pipeline and will remain a major user
of the system, the company said in a statement on its Web site
today. Continued access to capacity is assured through the
third-party open access regime created when Gassled was
established, the company said. The sale is subject to the
approval of the Norwegian authorities. 
&#8220;This divestment will have no impact on Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
operated or partner-operated producing assets in Norway,&#8221; the
company said in the statement. Kristin Kragseth, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
spokeswoman in Norway, declined to comment on the price the
company got for the stake. 
Gassled, a joint venture created in 2003 between oil and
gas companies operating on the Norwegian continental shelf, owns
the country&#8217;s gas transport infrastructure. Exxon was among the
partners that complained to Norway&#8217;s government in 2008 when
state-controlled Statoil ASA and Petoro AS took control of the
network, holding 32.1 percent and 38.46 percent respectively. 
The company began marketing its stake last summer, Eirik
Hauge, a spokesman for Exxon, said in August. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA, Dong Energy A/S
and ConocoPhillips are also stakeholders in Gassled.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show net income declined from
the end of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending
when it reports first-quarter earnings tomorrow. 
Profit was probably about $2.93 billion, or 64 cents a
share, according to the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. That compares with net income of $3.28 billion, or
74 cents, in the fourth quarter and $2.14 billion, or 40 cents,
a year earlier during the depths of the financial crisis. 
Mortgage writedowns may be as high as $2.5 billion per
quarter during 2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009,
according to company data. Analysts including Anthony Polini at
Raymond James  Associates said they will be watching to see if
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was able to reduce
provisions against future credit losses as a gauge of whether
the worst of the U.S. housing crisis is over. 
&#8220;The key factor for this quarter for banks will be to say
reserve builds are largely behind us and the outlook for lower
problem loans and loan losses have improved for the second half
of the year,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the outlook that matters.&#8221; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest competitors will probably post profits
for the quarter, according to the Bloomberg survey, even as U.S.
lenders are collapsing at the fastest pace in 17 years.
Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America Corp., may report earnings of $455 million when
it releases results on April 19, the survey shows. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America may report a profit of
$1.42 billion on April 16. 
Credit Quality 
&#8220;For the banks, the thing that matters more than anything
else is the trend in credit quality and the rate of inflow of
new problem loans. That trumps all,&#8221; said Chris Kotowski, an
equity analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t
mean that there aren&#8217;t any new problems coming in, but the rate
of inflows are diminished.&#8221; 
Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$1.77 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis and the
worst job market in 26 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The pace of losses has begun to slow in the past two
quarters and the housing market has shown signs of stabilization
even as the federal government withdraws support from financial
markets. 
Problem Loans 
Charge-offs from consumer credit-card and mortgage loans at
JPMorgan are expected to be about $8.6 billion in the first
quarter, a 10 percent increase from the previous three months,
according to Credit Suisse analysts led by Moshe Orenbuch.
&#8220;Reserving remains the largest variable to reported earnings,&#8221;
they wrote in an April 8 research note to clients. 
Dimon has succeeded in generating profit throughout the
global credit contraction, suggesting he may be able to restore
the dividend to pre-crisis levels before major competitors. 
The bank, which cut its quarterly payout to shareholders to
5 cents from 38 cents in February 2009, may boost the dividend
if the U.S. economy shows several months of improvement in the
jobless rate and there is a &#8220;significant reduction&#8221; in charge-
offs, Dimon said last month in his annual letter to
shareholders. 
The 54-year-old CEO claimed credit in the letter for
helping to stabilize markets during the crisis by purchasing
Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual as they headed toward
collapse. 
Credit Cards 
JPMorgan is offsetting declines in mortgage banking and
credit cards with trading revenue, which analysts from Credit
Suisse estimated will show an increase to $4.9 billion from $3
billion in the fourth quarter. Credit Suisse said a credit-
market recovery was fueling fixed-income results at JPMorgan. 
&#8220;The credit markets really, really did well in the first
quarter,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets
in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s mainly because the Fed is
printing money and there&#8217;s a lot of money sitting on the
sidelines coming into the market right now, especially in the
fixed-income side.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said a
&#8220;broad-based&#8221; economic recovery boosted first-quarter earnings
55 percent, surprising analysts with record fixed-income trading
revenue and a better-than-expected outlook for consumer credit. 
Net income at the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets
climbed to $3.33 billion, or 74 cents a share, from $2.14
billion, or 40 cents, in the same period a year earlier and from
$3.28 billion in the fourth quarter, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. Record fixed-income trading revenue
and a reduction in provisions for credit losses helped the bank
beat the average estimate of 64 cents per share projected by 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;There is clear and broad-based improvement in the
economic factors in the United States and around the world,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, told reporters on a
conference call. 
Dimon cited signs including stabilizing U.S. home prices
that signal the economy may be poised for a &#8220;strong recovery.&#8221;
Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said delinquencies for
credit cards and mortgages in which the borrower is behind by
just one payment also improved in the first quarter, indicating
that consumers&#8217; finances are gaining strength after the worst
recession in more than 70 years. 
JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in federal aid last
year, remained profitable throughout the financial crisis,
relying on fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending
and credit cards. The bank, the No. 1 underwriter of stocks and
bonds in the U.S. last year, generated three-quarters of first-
quarter profit from its investment bank. 
Unexpected Strength 
&#8220;Nobody saw those types of numbers coming,&#8221; said Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings bode well for Bank of America Corp. and
other banks, which report earnings later this month, Miller
said. &#8220;Credit remains a wild card here, but Jamie talked very,
very positive about credit and the consumer,&#8221; he said. 
JPMorgan rose $1.86, or 4.1 percent, to $47.73 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m., the biggest
gain in six months and the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008. The
shares are up 15 percent this year. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s growing, India&#8217;s growing, Japan is growing, home
prices have stopped going down, consumer income is up, consumers
are spending, service and manufacturing indexes are up,
inventories are still low, I could go on and on,&#8221; Dimon said.
&#8220;This could be the makings of a good recovery. We don&#8217;t know
for sure, but if you look at those factors, it&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221; 
&#8216;Real Improvement&#8217; 
Cavanagh said on the call that there is &#8220;fundamental real
improvement&#8221; in consumer mortgage and credit-card
delinquencies. That didn&#8217;t translate into lower credit costs for
the quarter, though he said it &#8220;augurs well for future quarters
if those trends sustain themselves.&#8221; 
Home lending and credit-card losses continued to pull down
earnings. Retail banking lost $131 million, compared with a $399
million net loss during the fourth quarter and a $474 million
gain a year earlier. 
The company decreased provisions against future credit
losses while setting aside $2.3 billion in reserves for lawsuits
stemming from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc. Credit-card
services lost $303 million, compared with a net loss of $306
million in the prior three months and $547 million a year
earlier. 
First-quarter revenue climbed 11 percent to $27.7 billion,
beating the highest estimate among analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. Fixed-income revenue was $5.46 billion, compared with
$4.89 billion a year earlier. 
Fixed Income 
The firm said improving fixed-income markets contributed to
the revenue gains, as did a $462 million reversal of provisions
for credit costs in investment banking, which compared with $1.2
billion in expenses a year earlier. JPMorgan cited lower loan
balances, driven by repayments and loan sales. 
The bank reduced total provisions for credit losses in all
divisions to $7 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in the
previous quarter and $10 billion the year before. 
The investment bank contributed $2.47 billion of JPMorgan&#8217;s
$3.33 billion in net income, or 74 percent. That compares with
57 percent in the fourth quarter and 75 percent in the first
quarter of 2009. 
&#8220;The good news is that the revenue picture was actually
quite strong,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC, in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio.
&#8220;And in particular, within investment banking, fixed-income
trading. That had been an area of concern, so March must have
been a blockbuster month.&#8221; 
Citigroup Earnings 
JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest lender behind
JPMorgan and Bank of America, may report earnings of $340
million when it releases results on April 19, the Bloomberg
survey shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $1.1 billion on April 16. 
Dimon and Cavanagh didn&#8217;t give shareholders immediate hope
of restoring the quarterly dividend, which was cut to 5 cents
from 38 cents in February 2009. 
&#8220;We want to see continued sustained improvement in
employment, continued sustained improvement in delinquencies&#8221;
and a better understanding of new bank capital rules before the
dividend will increase, Dimon said, reiterating what he told
shareholders in his annual letter last month. 
Cavanagh said that increasing the payout to shareholders is
&#8220;going to be down the road a little more.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley, once the biggest
property investor among Wall Street banks, expects to lose $5.4
billion, or 61 percent, of its $8.8 billion global fund, said a
person familiar with the situation. 
The firm sent a fourth-quarter update to clients in recent
weeks showing the 2007 fund was likely to recover $3.4 billion
of its investments, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. A spokesman for
New York-based Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Morgan Stanley raised the fund, Morgan Stanley Real Estate
Fund VI International, toward the end of the property surge when
market prices were at or near the peak. At the time, it was the
largest private fund targeting high-return real estate
investments. 
&#8220;Funds of this vintage year are horribly stressed and much
of the equity they&#8217;ve invested has evaporated,&#8221; said Nori
Gerardo Lietz, head of real estate private equity at Partners
Group, who warned in July 2008 that pension funds likely would
face big writedowns on real estate in the next two years.
While the real estate losses at Morgan Stanley and other Wall
Street banks have been increasingly evident since late 2008,
&#8220;people are coming to grips with it,&#8221; said Gerardo Lietz in a
telephone interview today. 
The expected loss was reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal. 
Morgan Stanley invested its 2007 fund around the world,
including Asia and Europe. In the U.S., the firm defaulted last
year on a $2 billion loan to buy Crescent Real Estate Equities
Co. in 2007 and handed over 17 million square feet of office
buildings to lender Barclays Capital. Morgan Stanley agreed in
2009 to relinquish five San Francisco office buildings to its
lender, two years after buying them from Blackstone Group LP. 
Once the second-largest U.S. securities firm, Morgan
Stanley converted to a bank holding company in September 2008
and accepted $10 billion of government bailout funds to survive
the credit crisis.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week. 
O&#8217;Neill said in an interview that trading in local
currencies among Brazil, Russia, India and China -- to be
discussed at a heads-of-state summit of so-called BRIC nations
this week in Brasilia -- won&#8217;t work because of China&#8217;s use of a
dollar peg to manage the value of the yuan. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all semantics to talk about trade in local currency
unless they do what the rest of world wants them to, which is
provide more freedom to use these currencies,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, 53,
said from London. &#8220;The consequences of Chinese policies are
increasingly seen by everyone, including the BRICs.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is building as BRIC
leaders get ready to meet this week to discuss boosting trade in
local currency and coordinating positions on reforming the
international financial system after the global credit crisis.
Chinese President Hu Jintao, who arrives in Brasilia tonight
from the U.S., told President Barack Obama yesterday that China
won&#8217;t bow to pressure after the U.S. leader urged the Asian
country to adopt a &#8220;more market-oriented exchange rate.&#8221; 
Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards rose 0.2 percent
to 6.6225 per dollar as of 12:27 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent from the spot rate of
6.8258. 
Stronger Yuan 
O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to describe the
four large, fast-growing economies, said he was pushing up his
forecast for a stronger yuan from the end of the year because it
is increasingly obvious the currency is undervalued. 
&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s exchange rate policy is &#8220;a particularly big
challenge for Brazilian&#8221; manufacturers as the country seeks to
reduce its reliance on commodity exports, O&#8217;Neill said. China
surpassed the U.S. as Brazil&#8217;s biggest trading partner last
year, as exports of iron-ore and soy rose during the global
recession while manufacturing sales to the U.S. declined. 
Still, even as the countries disagree over how to manage
their currencies, he expects no tension or public criticism of
the yuan&#8217;s peg when Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva hosts his Russian, Indian and Chinese counterparts. 
Instead, the second meeting for leaders from the four
nations will seek to find common ground about ways to reform the
International Monetary Fund, United Nations and other
international institutions. 
&#8220;Being Mr. BRIC, of course I&#8217;m flattered these guys now
meet together, but beyond all being large economies what else
can they really do collectively,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This summit
is a very powerful symbol of how hopeless international
organizations have become.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
property funds may receive investments of as much as $100
million each from the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System
as the pension plan seeks to boost real estate holdings. 
The Tennessee system, with $29 billion in assets, is
considering putting money in the open-ended JPMorgan Strategic
Property Fund and the UBS Trumbull Property Fund, according to a
report prepared for pension board trustees. Townsend Group, the
system&#8217;s real estate consultant, recommends the funds to
clients, according to the report. 
The Tennessee retirement system plans to invest $1 billion
in real estate over the next five years. U.S. property purchases
have plunged since 2007 as values fell and financing dried up.
This year, commercial real estate sales likely will be double
the $52 billion recorded in 2009, while still below their $500
billion peak, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based research company. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still slow, but it certainly looks better than it
did six to 12 months ago,&#8221; said Robert Bach, chief economist
for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-based commercial
broker. &#8220;There seems to be a lot of capital out there.&#8221; 
January&#8217;s commercial real estate values in the U.S. were 40
percent below the peak in October 2007, according to the
Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index. 
Estimated Returns 
JPMorgan&#8217;s fund is estimated to return a dividend of 4.25
percent after fees and the UBS fund is expected to yield 4
percent. The gross asset value of the JPMorgan fund was $14.8
billion and the UBS fund $9.7 billion, according to the
Tennessee report. 
Kris Kagel, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS, and Jackie
Meere of JPMorgan in New York both declined to comment. 
The State Universities Retirement System of Illinois
approved investing $100 million in the UBS fund in December,
according to meeting minutes. The UBS fund had most of its money
in office buildings, apartments and retail centers as of the end
of September, according to an annual review of UBS Realty
Investors by a staff member of the Illinois retirement system.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s head of
investment banking in India, Vedika Bhandarkar, told colleagues
she plans to quit and join Credit Suisse Group, people close to
each firm said. 
Bhandarkar, who&#8217;s been at JPMorgan in India since 1998, is
in talks with Credit Suisse about overseeing its Indian
investment banking unit, according to one of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Sandeep Pangal, a managing director in JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate
finance group in Mumbai, may accompany Bhandarkar to the Swiss
bank, the people said. 
Bhandarkar and Pangal declined to comment, as did JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kavita Sonawala and Credit Suisse spokesman Adam
Harper. The two bankers have worked together for clients
including NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest mobile-phone company,
which they advised on its 2008 purchase of a $2.7 billion stake
in Tata Teleservices Ltd. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost
the vice chairman of its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last
month. She left to become country head for Bank of America Corp. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, ranks third among advisers on
mergers and acquisitions in India during the past 12 months,
based on the total dollar value of announced transactions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
is first and Morgan Stanley second. Zurich-based Credit Suisse
ranks fourth. 
So far this year, JPMorgan is No. eight in advising on
stock sales in the country, behind Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg data
show. Credit Suisse ranks 24th. 
Credit Suisse in November said it named Rahul Chawla as
head of global markets solutions for India. In that position,
Chawla will help originate equity and debt capital markets
transactions among other things, Credit Suisse said at the time.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. claims Grupo
Televisa SA&#8217;s cable unit breached a credit agreement by
objecting to the transfer of a loan from the bank to one
controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim. 
A federal judge in New York in February halted the transfer
after Empresas Cablevision SA complained that assigning the loan
to Slim&#8217;s Banco Inbursa SA might reveal Cablevision&#8217;s
confidential information to a rival cable company owned by Slim. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is asking U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff to order Cablevision to consent to
assigning 90 percent of the $225 million loan to Banco Inbursa. 
&#8220;Cablevision&#8217;s refusal to consent to JPMorgan&#8217;s proposed
assignment to Banco Inbursa was unreasonable and therefore a
breach of the credit assignment,&#8221; JPMorgan said in its filing
yesterday. 
The Televisa unit got the loan in December of 2007 to buy
Bestel SA, which operated a fiber-optic network in Mexico.
JPMorgan originally intended to syndicate the loan but didn&#8217;t do
so in 2008 because of the deteriorating credit market, according
to the ruling. Last year, the bank started efforts to sell the
loan to Inbursa. 
Banco Inbursa is part of Grupo Financiero Inbursa SA,
controlled by Slim, as is Telefonos de Mexico SAB, or Telmex,
Mexico&#8217;s biggest land-line phone company. Telmex seeks to expand
into other telecommunications markets and is a primary
competitor of Cablevision, Rakoff said in the February ruling. 
Irreparable Harm 
Cablevision had shown it was likely to prevail on its claim
and a probability of irreparable harm, the judge said in
February. The participation agreement, under which the loan was
to be transferred, would enable Inbursa to use JPMorgan as a
vehicle for demanding Cablevision&#8217;s confidential information
&#8220;on a virtual unlimited basis,&#8221; according to Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. 
Televisa didn&#8217;t immediately comment, and a spokesman for
Slim didn&#8217;t return messages seeking comment. 
The case is Empresas Cablevision v. JPMorgan, 09-9972, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Xenon Capital Partners, an

Stan Song and Hamid Gayibov quit JPMorgan last week and may

Credit Suisse hired five fixed-income specialists last month,

Xenon said it needs more bankers to handle a &#8220;range of MA
mandates for state-owned corporates in the energy sector,&#8221;
describing Song as one of Russia&#8217;s &#8220;most reputable MA
bankers&#8221; and Gayibov as a &#8220;rainmaker&#8221; executive. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s former head of investment banking in Russia,
Natalia Tsukanova, set up Xenon last year to advise Igor Sechin,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#8217;s deputy for energy and chairman
of OAO Rosneft, the country&#8217;s largest oil company. Ex-JPMorgan
MA banker Kamil Burganov joined Xenon in February and another
colleague Anton Voronin came over in March, Burganov said. 
Twenty Hires 
Xenon is expanding as the government consolidates state
assets in industries including energy, aerospace and
shipbuilding to help reduce Russia&#8217;s dependence on oil and gas
exports, and prepares some for sale. Russia is combining six
state-owned regional airlines under OAO Aeroflot. State shipping
company Sovcomflot plans to sell shares in an initial public
offering in late 2010 or early 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Sergei Frank, a former transport minister, told reporters in
Moscow today. 
Xenon plans to hire a total of 20 staff to focus on
consolidation in the domestic energy industry and later help
state-owned companies with foreign acquisitions, Burganov said.
The company has a London office which will eventually advise
companies seeking to list on the London Stock Exchange, he said. 
As well as consulting on acquisitions, Xenon manages a $2
billion state-owned power utilities fund, Burganov said. The
fund, called Rusenergo, holds stakes in companies including OAO
Rushydro, Russia&#8217;s largest hydropower producer, and electricity
producers known as TGKs and OGKs, Burganov said. 
&#8220;The fund is focused exclusively on the power sector,&#8221;
Burganov said by phone. &#8220;But our MA advisory work for state-
owned companies will cover oil, gas, oil-services, utilities and
manufacturing sectors.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said the Chinese government may let
its currency become free floating within five years. 
&#8220;China has made noises about the renminbi being part of
the SDR from 2015,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today, referring to the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s
Special Drawing Rights. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really be part of the SDR
unless you have completely free-floating exchange rates and free
capital markets. That would imply that those who make those
noises, primarily&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China, are &#8220;pushing
for the next five years.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s current 21-month peg to
the dollar is building as Chinese President Hu Jintao this week
meets with the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India in Brasilia
to discuss boosting trade in local currency and reforming the
international financial system. President Barack Obama said this
week that the U.S. considers the yuan to be &#8220;undervalued.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s economic growth quickened to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, data released today
showed, highlighting overheating risks that may prompt the
government to scrap the peg. 
&#8220;China is increasingly the most important, not only
emerging economy, but economy, full stop, in the world,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;These first-quarter numbers take it to being the
same size as Japan. If you look at their share of world trade,
the renminbi should definitely be a wider-used currency.&#8221; 
PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan last year said the IMF&#8217;s SDRs
offer &#8220;light in the tunnel for the reform of the international
monetary system.&#8221; SDRs are a unit of account, based on a basket
of currencies, used in IMF transactions. 
The meeting this week in Brasilia is the second heads-of-
state summit of the largest emerging economies, which includes
Brazil, Russia, India and China, or so-called BRIC nations, a
term coined by O&#8217;Neill in 2001. The leaders will discuss
broadening the array of world currencies used in international
trade as the four developing nations seek to lessen their
dependence on the U.S. dollar.

China&#8217;s stock-index futures begin
trading tomorrow, giving investors a tool to hedge against
potential risks from an overheating economy and asset bubbles. 
The contracts are part of China&#8217;s push to make more
investment options available to local investors and ease market
fluctuations after the Shanghai Composite Index slumped the most
among global markets this year following an 80 percent rally in
2009. They will be based on the CSI 300 Index, tracking the 300
biggest stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. 
&#8220;They can be used obviously for speculation but
importantly, they can also be used for hedging,&#8221; Hugh Young,
who helps oversee $232 billion of assets as head of equities at
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in Singapore, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Like all these instruments it depends on
how well you use them.&#8221; 
The Shanghai index has fallen 3.4 percent in 2010, making
it the worst performer in Asia, on concern the government will
tighten monetary policy to slow record lending growth and
soaring property prices. The government has twice this year
required banks to set aside a larger proportion of deposits as
reserves this year. The CSI 300 Index has fallen 4.8 percent. 
China&#8217;s economic growth accelerated to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, highlighting
overheating risks that may prompt the government to scrap the
yuan&#8217;s peg to the dollar. 
Asset Bubbles 
Last year&#8217;s rally in Chinese stocks and property prices
have prompted analysts including former Morgan Stanley economist
Andy Xie to call the nation&#8217;s asset markets a bubble that will
burst once the government curbs credit. China is &#8220;on a treadmill
to hell,&#8221; with growth driven by the &#8220;heroin of property
development,&#8221; hedge fund manager James Chanos said last week. 
&#8220;They do come with higher risks and volatility but I think
it&#8217;s the way markets develop,&#8221; Aberdeen&#8217;s Young said. 
The trading of stock-index futures on the China Financial
Futures Exchange in Shanghai follows the introduction of margin
trading and short selling on March 31. Shanghai, which has plans
to develop into an international financial center by 2020, may
start a board for listings by overseas companies later this year,
the China Daily newspaper reported today. 
The futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell the CSI
300 Index at a preset value on an agreed date. 
Investors need a minimum 500,000 yuan to open an account to
trade stock-index futures, according to rules by the securities
regulator and the China Financial Futures Exchange. 
Rising Liquidity 
They must pay cash deposits equivalent to 15 percent of the
contract value for May and June contracts and 18 percent for
contracts for September and December. The contract values are
points of the CSI 300 multiplied by 300 yuan and the minimum
contract price movement is 0.2 point, according to the futures
exchange. 
Trading will be at the &#8220;expensive side of fair value&#8221; as
volumes will be limited initially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in a report today. 
&#8220;Under close monitoring by authorities, we expect a
gradual increase in liquidity, but even then we do not expect a
significant direct impact on the stock market,&#8221; Christopher
Eoyang and Jason Lui, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
report. 
Trading volumes for China&#8217;s local-currency A shares should
increase with the introduction of stock index futures, Jing
Ulrich, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s chairwoman for China equities and
commodities, said last month. 
China has the world&#8217;s third largest stock market by market
capitalization, briefly overtaking Japan in July 2009. The U.S.
is the biggest by market cap. 
U.S. Challenge 
China&#8217;s increased trading in equities from index futures
will help the nation challenge the U.S. as the world&#8217;s busiest
stock market, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co. and HSBC
Jintrust Fund Management Co. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s possible for China to surpass the U.S. in terms of
trading volumes, and index futures trading is one positive
factor that&#8217;s bolstering transactions,&#8221; Liang Jing, a Shanghai-
based analyst at Guotai, the nation&#8217;s second-largest brokerage
in terms of broking revenue, said last week. 
China currently restricts overseas investors to buying B
shares that trade in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong
dollars in Shenzen. China&#8217;s yuan-denominated A shares, are
mostly limited to local investors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week, even
as the cabinet signaled caution in ending crisis policies. 
O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to highlight the
growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said in an
interview yesterday in London he was pushing up his forecast on
the move from year-end because the currency is undervalued.
China may avoid a one-time gain that might endanger exports,
while allowing gradual appreciation by June 30 to curb inflation,
a survey of economists this week by Bloomberg News showed. 
China has pegged its currency at about 6.8 to the dollar
since July 2008, which some U.S. lawmakers say gives the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy an unfair trade advantage. The
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent to 6.62 per dollar by year-
end, according to the median estimate among the 19 economists. 
&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; 
Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards strengthened 0.1
percent to 6.6161 per dollar as of 12:40 p.m. in Hong Kong. The
contracts reflect bets the currency will appreciate 3.2 percent
from the spot rate of 6.8257. 
Accelerating Economy 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
that a more flexible yuan would help the world&#8217;s third-largest
economy keep inflation under control. Bernanke, responding to
questions from Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York,
said Chinese authorities are also subject to pressure from
exporters who want to keep the yuan low against the dollar. 
China is seeking a &#8220;stable yuan&#8221; to control hot money
flows, Yao Jian, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, told
reporters today. Residential and commercial real-estate prices
in 70 cities climbed 11.7 percent in March from a year earlier,
the most since data began in 2005. 
The economy grew 11.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, more than the median 11.7 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists. The consumer-price index
gained 2.4 percent last month, compared with 2.7 percent in
February, the statistics bureau reported today. 
Cabinet Caution 
China&#8217;s cabinet said &#8220;rapid&#8221; first-quarter growth was
largely driven by stimulus policies and a comparison with a low
level a year earlier, suggesting officials may be cautious in
ending crisis policies. 
&#8220;The environment for economic development is extremely
complex,&#8221; the cabinet said in a statement on a government Web
site yesterday evening after a meeting chaired by Premier Wen
Jiabao. &#8220;The economic rebound still faces many difficulties.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is also building as
BRIC leaders get ready to meet this week in Brasilia to discuss
boosting trade in local currency and coordinating positions on
reforming the international financial system. 
&#8220;The Americans dare to speak about this,&#8221; said Stephen
Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in
Shanghai. &#8220;Other countries take a quiet line on the renminbi but
obviously those countries have exporters who would like to grow
their business as well.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised
its estimate for U.S. second-quarter economic growth to 3
percent from 2 percent and dropped its forecast for the jobless
rate to climb past 10 percent. 
U.S. unemployment will be in a range of 9.5 percent to 10
percent through the end of 2011, Ed McKelvey, the company&#8217;s
senior U.S. economist, wrote in an e-mail. The unemployment rate
was 9.7 percent in March. 
Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank,
is sticking to its view that GDP growth will slow to a 1.5
percent pace during the second half of 2010, according to the
report. 
&#8220;While our expectations for overall growth beyond mid-year
have not changed, we have modestly upgraded our forecast for
consumer spending, with offsets in housing activity, state and
local spending, trade improvement, and inventory accumulation,&#8221;
wrote McKelvey, who is based in New York.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as U.S. regulators sued the
firm for fraud related to subprime-mortgage securities. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs rose the most in a
year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the
bank misstated and omitted key facts about collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market started to falter in 2007. The SEC&#8217;s charges are
&#8220;completely unfounded,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. 
Swaps on other banks, from Deutsche Bank AG to Citigroup
Inc. and Morgan Stanley, also rose on concerns the probe may
bolster efforts in Washington to crack down on the securities
industry.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It creates uncertainty,&#8221; said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit
analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. &#8220;The real point is how it
affects regulation and oversight of the securities industry. It
does give Washington more ammunition to tighten regulation.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman climbed 35 basis points to
130.5 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. 
Swaps on Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank rose 9.5 basis
points to 93.5 basis points, the most in a year, CMA prices
show. Contracts on Morgan Stanley jumped 17.5 to 139, those on
Citigroup rose 14 to 137, and swaps on Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit increased 18.5 to 141. 
Ripple Effects 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s headline risk, and it&#8217;s not good for the whole
sector,&#8221; said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economics
research at Stamford, Connecticut-based Aladdin Capital Holdings
LLC, which oversees $12.5 billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s like someone took a
giant stone and threw it into a pond, and it&#8217;s going to ripple
outward.&#8221; 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
the most in 10 weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 87.3
basis points, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The benchmark yesterday reached the lowest since Jan. 14
after declining for the sixth straight day, CMA prices show. The
index typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and
falls as it improves.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by U.S. regulators for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations that contributed to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The firm&#8217;s shares tumbled 13 percent and
financial stocks slumped. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today. Billionaire John
Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade and wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs
vice president who helped create the CDOs, known as Abacus. 
&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was
betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which
mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while
telling other investors that the securities were selected by an
independent, objective third party.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs became emblematic of public outrage at the
banking industry after posting a record $13.4 billion
profit in 2009, a year after receiving $10 billion in
taxpayer aid during the financial crisis. It repaid the
funds in June. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has been criticized by lawmakers
and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in
helping Greece mask the size of its debts. It called the SEC&#8217;s
claims &#8220;unfounded.&#8221; 
Financial Stocks Slump 
&#8220;Civil charges and the disgorgement are not the issue --
the threat to Goldman is reputational,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The danger is
to &#8220;ultimately its market share with its prized institutional
and corporate clients.&#8221; 
Shares of Goldman Sachs, based in New York, dropped $23.57,
or 13 percent, to $160.70 as of 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading. It marked the biggest one-day decline since
Jan. 20, 2009, and pushed the value of Warren Buffett&#8217;s options
to buy Goldman Sachs shares down by $950 million. 
Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Integrity&#8217; 
Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s chief executive officer,
got the warrants on $5 billion of Goldman Sachs stock as part of
an agreement that extended financing to the bank during the
depths of the 2008 credit crisis. The deal reflected Buffett&#8217;s
belief in &#8220;not just the strength of Goldman but its
integrity,&#8221; Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director said this week
in an interview. 
The cost to protect against a default on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
debt jumped 30.5 basis points, or 0.305 percentage point, to
120.5 basis points. 
&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s charges are completely unfounded in law and
fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and
its reputation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. 
The firm put together the Abacus deal in 2007, a year in
which Goldman Sachs earned a then-record $11.6 billion, a figure
it surpassed in 2009, when it earned $13.4 billion. Goldman
Sachs paid Blankfein $68.5 million for 2007 -- $600,000 in
salary, plus a $67.9 million bonus. 
According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Tourre, now 31, sent an
e-mail to a friend in January 2007 saying, &#8220;The whole building
is about to collapse&#8221; in reference to CDOs tied to subprime
mortgages. 
&#8216;Fabulous Fab&#8217; 
&#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab standing in the
middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he
created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstrousities!!!&#8221; Tourre wrote in the e-
mail, according to the SEC. The agency didn&#8217;t identify the
recipient of the note. 
Reached at his London office today, Tourre declined to
comment. &#8220;I need to jump, thank you, goodbye,&#8221; he told
Bloomberg News before hanging up. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a
lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. Tourre,
a graduate of Ecole Centrale Paris, one of France&#8217;s top
engineering schools, and Stanford University, joined Goldman
Sachs in July 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
Goldman Sachs and Tourre knew it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to sell the CDO if they disclosed to investors that
Paulson played a significant role in selecting the collateral
and was also betting against it, the SEC said. 
&#8216;Surreal&#8217; ACA Meeting 
The bank also knew that at least one potential investor,
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t
likely to invest in a CDO that didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager
to analyze and select the portfolio, according to the complaint. 
In January 2007, Goldman Sachs approached ACA Management
LLC, a firm that analyzes credit risk, to select the portfolio
for a CDO transaction sponsored by Paulson. In an internal memo
on March 12, 2007, Goldman said it would &#8220;leverage ACA&#8217;s
credibility and franchise&#8221; to help distribute the transaction,
the SEC said. 
Paulson, Tourre and a representative from ACA met in
February 2007 to discuss assets that would be included in the
residential-mortgage backed security, the SEC said. While
Paulson and Tourre knew Paulson intended to short the security,
ACA wasn&#8217;t in the loop. 
&#8220;I am at this ACA meeting,&#8221; Tourre wrote in an e-mail to
an unidentified Goldman Sachs employee during the meeting.
&#8220;This is surreal.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Extensive Disclosure&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs also said that it lost more than $90 million
because it had an investment in the deal, overwhelming the $15
million it made in fees. The firm said it provided &#8220;extensive
disclosure&#8221; to IKB and ACA about the risk of the underlying
mortgage securities. Goldman Sachs never told ACA that Paulson
was going to be a &#8220;long&#8221; investor in Abacus, and ACA selected
the underlying securities, the firm said. 
Paulson  Co., which oversees $32 billion, said in a
statement that the fund didn&#8217;t make any misrepresentations
connected to the Abacus deal. 
&#8220;While Paulson purchased credit protection from Goldman
Sachs on securities issued under the Abacus ABS CDO program we
were not involved in the marketing of any Abacus products to any
third parties,&#8221; the New York-based firm said. &#8220;ACA as
collateral manager had sole authority over the selection of all
collateral in the CDO.&#8221; 
Paulson could be the target of investor lawsuits now that
the SEC is investigating how Abacus was put together, said
Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for two bond insurers
and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin Krieg  Adams LLP. 
&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been many investor lawsuits on these kinds
of deals,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;This opens the door to civil claims
across a number of transactions.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost at
least 4 percent today as all 27 companies in the SP 500
Diversified Financial Index declined. In Europe, Deutsche Bank
AG dropped 8 percent. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of

     April 16 (Bloomberg) --&#160;For bearish options traders, the
Securities and Exchange Commission couldn&#8217;t have picked a better
day to charge Goldman Sachs Group Inc. with fraud. 
Puts giving the right to sell Goldman shares at $175 before
today&#8217;s close, which were worth 3 cents yesterday, soared to
$14.15 for the biggest gain among options on the stock. Goldman
shares fell 13 percent to $160.70 in New York. 
&#8220;Everything moves in an exponential manner on expiration
day when you have unexpected news like this,&#8221; said Steve Quirk,
managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. in
Chicago. &#8220;This is a very good example of why you cover short
options even if they&#8217;re worthless and 10 or 20 percent away from
the current trading price near expiration.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs plunged the most in almost three months after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New York-
based firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations
that contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
The April $165 puts jumped to $4 from 1 cent yesterday.
Those contracts traded more than 29,000 times, almost double the
number of outstanding options before today.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, said it completed the world&#8217;s longest well from a
fixed offshore platform, boosting production off California. 
The well from the Heritage platform in federal waters west
of Santa Barbara reaches 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) below sea
level and extends 6.3 miles (10 kilometers) horizontally,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil said today in a statement. 
Output from the well in the Santa Inez field will be
equivalent to 5.8 million barrels of oil, enough for the annual
energy consumption of about 144,000 Californians, the company
said. Exxon Mobil and environmental groups in 1995 agreed on
measures to protect people and marine life during exploration
from its existing platforms in Santa Inez. 
The company said in a Feb. 1 conference call that the well
had been drilled a total of more than 37,000 feet, a North
American record. 
Exxon Mobil fell 33 cents to $67.93 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed
for the year.

General Growth Properties Inc. is
seeking a higher price, fewer stock warrants or both from
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. after its bankruptcy exit plan
was matched by Simon Property Group Inc., a person with
knowledge of the discussions said. 
General Growth, the second-biggest U.S. mall owner, also is
continuing to talk with larger rival Simon, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the discussions are private.
General Growth needs to decide if it will continue to back
Brookfield&#8217;s plan before a bankruptcy court hearing on the
competing proposals, scheduled for April 29. 
Simon, whose $10 billion takeover offer for General Growth
was turned down as too low in February, earlier this week
pledged to invest $2.5 billion in a reorganization of the
company and match the terms of a plan by Brookfield and partners
Fairholme Capital Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital
Management LP. Simon said its proposal is better for General
Growth shareholders than the Brookfield plan because it doesn&#8217;t
include issuing warrants that may dilute stock value. 
Brookfield &#8220;is averse to participating in bidding wars and
may not currently feel that it has to,&#8221; Cedrik Lachance, a
senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach,
California, wrote in a note to investors last night. &#8220;However,
the mathematics of recapitalizing GGP at higher prices suggests
that there is room for a higher bid.&#8221; 
Hedge fund Paulson  Co. pledged to invest $1 billion as
part of the proposal by Indianapolis-based Simon. General Growth
said this week that it will study the new offer. 
Katherine Vyse, a spokeswoman for Brookfield, declined to
comment, as did Hugh Burns, a Simon spokesman. 
Business Plan 
To win backing from General Growth, Simon needs to explain
its planned strategy for the company, the person familiar with
the talks said. Given that Simon would own a large stake in its
biggest rival, akin to Coca-Cola Co. investing in PepsiCo Inc.,
the company needs to lay out details of its multi-year business
plan for General Growth, the person said. 
Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner, said this week it&#8217;s
still willing to buy Chicago-based General Growth outright. The
$6.55 billion plan by the Brookfield-led group seeks so-called
stalking horse status at the April 29 hearing and would include
issuing stock warrants if the proposal is approved by the court,
increasing the price of any future takeover by another bidder. 
Independent Company 
General Growth would emerge from bankruptcy as an
independent company under both the Brookfield plan and Simon&#8217;s
new offer. The mall owner filed the largest real estate
bankruptcy in U.S. history one year ago after amassing $27
billion in debt making acquisitions. Its properties include New
York&#8217;s South Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand
Canal Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
Simon would buy 250 million shares at $10 each under its
new offer, which it said is the same amount Toronto-based
Brookfield would acquire under its plan and at the same price.
It would also agree to the same terms as Brookfield&#8217;s proposal
for the recapitalization of the company and planned spinoff of a
new entity, David Simon wrote in an April 14 letter to General
Growth CEO Adam Metz.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Vedika
Bhandarkar will join Credit Suisse Group AG as vice chairman
and head of investment banking operations in India, the Wall
Street bank&#8217;s second senior departure in the country in a month. 
Credit Suisse also hired JPMorgan&#8217;s Sandeep Pangal who will
report to Bhandarkar as a managing director, spokesman Adam
Harper said by phone today. Bhandarkar will report to Mihir
Doshi, Credit Suisse&#8217;s India head. 
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, which ranks 24th in advising
Indian stock sales, aims to grow the business tapping rising
investor demand for equities in the country. JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost the vice chairman of
its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last month after she left to
become country head for Bank of America Corp. 
&#8220;India is central to our strategy and we are confident
that Vedika and Sandeep can build on our momentum to take the
business to the next level,&#8221; Vikram Malhotra, Credit Suisse&#8217;s
co-head of investment banking for Asia Pacific, said in an e-
mail. 
Bhandarkar joined JPMorgan in India in 1998 and Pangal
joined the following year. While at JPMorgan the two worked
together advising on deals including NTT DoCoMo Inc.&#8217;s $2.7
billion stake in Tata Teleservices Ltd. in 2008. 
So far this year, JPMorgan is No. 8 in advising on stock
sales in India, behind firms including Citigroup Inc., UBS AG,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg
data show. 
Bhandarkar will also report to Vikram Malhotra and Helman
Sitohang, co-heads of investment banking for Asia Pacific, based
in Hong Kong and Singapore respectively.

Bo Vavrusa was heaping dirt into
the path of a wildfire on a Texas ranch in October 2007 when his
tractor rammed an Exxon Mobil Corp. natural-gas pipe hidden in a
thicket. Flames engulfed the tractor, burning his face, arms and
hands as he fled. 
&#8220;I thought I was fixing to die,&#8221; said Vavrusa, 28, who
was earning $10 an hour to groom the ranch for quail and dove
hunters. 
Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil producer, has neglected this
stretch of Texas since its oil fields began drying up in the
1970s, said Jerry Patterson, the state&#8217;s General Land Office
Commissioner. Now Patterson and other state officials are urging
Texas lawmakers to follow the examples of California and
Pennsylvania in cracking down on oilfield practices that have
left leaking pipelines, wells and storage tanks. 
Oozing chemical pits and Vavrusa&#8217;s scarred skin are
emblematic of a legacy Exxon has sought to keep buried in court,
even as it gears up for a return to active exploration within
miles of the ranch through its pending $29.3 billion acquisition
of Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. 
Exxon&#8217;s renewed focus on North America follows nationalist
energy policies in Venezuela and Russia that reduced
opportunities to profit abroad. It coincides with fresh scrutiny
in the U.S. that is leading Congress to examine whether stricter
drilling regulations are needed. 
Oil&#8217;s &#8216;Ugly Side&#8217; 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t something the states are proud to advertise,&#8221;
said Philip Dellinger, chief of the groundwater section in the
Austin, Texas, office of the Environmental Protection Agency.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the ugly side of the oil and gas business.&#8221; 
The EPA says it has no authority to force companies to
address contamination on active fields and must defer to Texas
regulators, who let oil companies determine if sites need
cleanup. 
In Pennsylvania, where the petroleum industry was born with
Edwin Drake&#8217;s 1859 discovery of crude, Governor Ed Rendell more
than doubled the number of well inspectors and has asked the
legislature to impose more than $400 million in new taxes on
companies pumping gas from the Marcellus Shale, a geologic
formation that extends from New York to Ohio and holds enough of
the fuel to supply the entire U.S. for 15 years. 
&#8220;I think the whole future of oil and gas in this country
depends on the companies having to pick up the last mess,&#8221; said
Elizabeth Burns, 43, who lives with her family on the Encinitos
Ranch where Vavrusa was injured. &#8220;Places like Pennsylvania and
New York need strong laws or this is what they&#8217;re going to
get.&#8221; 
Depression-Era Leases 
Relatives of Burns and her husband, Stephen, own the ranch
and much of the Kelsey oilfield beneath it. They&#8217;ve filed a
lawsuit against Exxon and Chevron Corp., which pumps oil and gas
on a smaller section of the spread. The suit accuses the
companies of damaging tens of thousands of acres and failing to
abide by 1930s-era leases they say require operators to keep
equipment clear of vegetation. 
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it spent $1.6 million last
year on remediation at the ranch and has conducted numerous soil
and water tests to mitigate environmental risks. 
&#8220;We are a responsible operator and refute any accusations
that suggest otherwise,&#8221; said David Eglinton, an Exxon
spokesman. &#8220;We currently have crews working to remove unneeded
facilities and, where appropriate, remediate affected areas to
applicable regulatory standards.&#8221; 
Chevron, the largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, &#8220;denies
these unsubstantiated allegations and intends to defend itself
in the litigation,&#8221; said Mickey Driver, a spokesman for the San
Ramon, California-based company. 
Expensive Slog 
If a judge finds Exxon and Chevron liable, they could be on
the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars, based on cleanup
costs incurred at other companies&#8217; oil fields in California. The
lawsuit is going to be an expensive slog, said Jeff Weems, a
Houston-based oil and gas lawyer who has represented BP PLC,
Europe&#8217;s second-biggest oil company, in Texas courts. 
&#8220;The legal route is a very long and difficult row to hoe
for an individual landowner,&#8221; said Weems, a Democrat who&#8217;s
running in November for a seat on the commission that regulates
the Texas oil and natural-gas industry. &#8220;They generally don&#8217;t
have the resources to seriously take on the big oil companies
that have legal departments that rival the largest law firms in
size and quality.&#8221; 
The Encinitos spread, located 40 miles from the Mexican
border, is dotted with scores of still-active gas pipes obscured
by brush and saplings that haven&#8217;t been cut. Beneath the dirt,
the Burns family has found leaks and dumps they blame for
undrinkable water and dead trees. 
Defunct Equipment 
Pollution from decades-old wells and waste pits isn&#8217;t
isolated to their ranch or Exxon. There are more than 100,000
old wells in Texas that haven&#8217;t been capped and thousands of
defunct gas-processing plants, compressor stations and related
equipment that have never been dismantled, according to the
Texas Land and Minerals Owners Association, which represents
1,200 ranchers, farmers and individuals who own stakes in oil
and gas fields. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty common problem in Texas,&#8221; said John B.
McFarland, an oil and gas attorney at Graves Dougherty Hearon 
Moody in Austin who has represented landowners with claims to
300,000 acres around the state. 
In Benavides, a rural town 60 miles north of the Burns&#8217;s
homestead, local officials sent residents letters in late 2008
warning them their drinking water contains as much as four-and-
a-half times as much arsenic as is considered safe by the U.S.
EPA. Arsenic can cause skin damage, circulatory problems and
cancer, the letter warned. 
Contamination Migrates 
The contamination may have migrated from a defunct oilfield
on the north end of town, where sludge and other waste from
wells was dumped in open dirt pits for decades, said J.T.
Garcia, president of the Duval County Conservation and
Reclamation District. He doesn&#8217;t know who operated the field,
which stopped pumping crude in the 1970s. 
The Burns&#8217;s ranch, which covers an area equal to the size
of Brooklyn, is just one example of the lingering environmental
damage across swaths of south, west and east Texas from what
were once regarded as acceptable oilfield practices, said
Patterson, the commissioner with the Texas General Land Office,
which oversees oil leases that help fund the state&#8217;s schools and
universities. 
&#8220;They&#8217;d just dig a pit and put the oil in it and then
they&#8217;d haul it off later, or maybe they wouldn&#8217;t haul it off
later, depending on the price of oil at the time,&#8221; said
Patterson. &#8220;That was the norm, and nobody said anything about
it.&#8221; 
Heavy Metals 
During the 1950s and &#8216;60s, oil companies filtered out some
byproducts at the wellhead and dumped the refuse in dirt pits.
That meant contaminants later buried when bulldozers covered the
holes had higher concentrations of petroleum-laced substances
and heavy metals than they otherwise would have, according to
the Burnses and an environmental survey of the ranch carried out
by Amistad Environmental LLC at the behest of the family&#8217;s
lawyers. 
Exxon, which pumps more oil than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, declined to discuss the
Burns lawsuit. The company has paid the family $19 million over
the past two decades in the form of royalties, Eglinton said.
Exxon has invested $190 million in development of the field
since the lease was signed in 1935, extracting 130 million
barrels of crude and 980 billion cubic feet of gas during that
time. 
The company&#8217;s presence in south Texas has enriched ranchers
and their communities, Eglinton said. Exxon paid $890 million in
taxes and royalties to the state in 2008, and Brooks County,
where the largest chunk of the Encinitos Ranch sits, relies on
oil and other mineral taxes for 70 percent of its school and
local government budgets, he said. 
Price of Pollution 
Those benefits came with a price measured in pollution that
has languished, partly because state laws and regulatory
agencies aren&#8217;t designed or equipped to police environmental
performance in the oil patch, said Weems and other critics. 
The Texas Railroad Commission that oversees the state&#8217;s oil
and natural-gas industry allows companies to hire their own
environmental consultants to check for contamination. Tests on
the Burns property conducted for Exxon by Netherlands-based
Arcadis NV gave the site a clean bill of health, said Ramona
Nye, a spokeswoman for the Austin-based commission. 
Elizabeth Burns had a different assessment. 
&#8220;They buried it, muck and all,&#8221; she said. 
Jeanna Blatt, a Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based spokeswoman
for Arcadis, declined to comment. 
OPEC&#8217;s Predecessor 
The railroad commission, created in 1891 to regulate
shipping rates, had its authority expanded to the nascent Texas
oil industry in the early 1900s, when rampant drilling glutted
world markets with crude and prices tumbled. 
The commission began restricting how much each well in the
state could produce, in a bid to prevent another free-fall in
prices. When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
was formed in 1960, the railroad commission was its model,
according to the Texas State Historical Association. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a mistake to have an agency that was originally set
up to serve the industry now being asked to police the industry
as its environmental regulator,&#8221; said McFarland, the oil and
gas attorney. 
The Texas legislature isn&#8217;t inclined to crack down on the
oil industry either, said Kelly Mcbeth, a legislative strategist
at Texas Energy Lobby, an Austin-based firm that represents
petroleum companies. Even wells that produce just a trickle of
oil or gas are revenue generators for the state. 
&#8216;An Economic Driver&#8217; 
&#8220;Legislators do everything they can to keep those wells on
line,&#8221; Mcbeth said. &#8220;They&#8217;re an economic driver for us.&#8221; 
The EPA doesn&#8217;t intervene in pollution cases on active
oilfields in Texas, said Dave Bary, a spokesman for EPA Region
6, which encompasses Texas, four other states and 65 American
Indian tribes. 
&#8220;The railroad commission has primacy over active
oilfields,&#8221; Bary said. 
Exxon, which had 2009 sales of $276 billion that dwarfed
the economic output of all but 33 of the world&#8217;s nations, wants
to seal the records in the Burns lawsuit, filed in December
2007. If Judge Richard C. Terrell of Texas&#8217;s 79th Judicial
District grants the company&#8217;s request, it would shield from
public view the details of how the company has operated on the
land. 
&#8220;The mindset of a major oil company is that they shouldn&#8217;t
have to compromise and you should be scared of them,&#8221; said
Roger S. Braugh Jr., the Sico, White, Hoelscher  Braugh LLC
attorney representing the Burns family. &#8220;To prove our case,
ultimately we&#8217;re looking at spending tens of millions of dollars
on environmental studies.&#8221; 
Off the Land 
The suit demands unspecified cleanup costs and seeks to kick
the oil companies off the land for breaching leases signed in
the 1930s, said Braugh, who&#8217;s based in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Vavrusa, the former ranch hand who now works for a company
that tests pipeline meters, sued Exxon and the ranch for
unspecified damages. Exxon failed to cut the vegetation that hid
the gas line from view, and the ranch family didn&#8217;t warn him the
line was there, he claimed in his suit. 
Exxon&#8217;s Eglinton said it was premature for the company to
comment on that suit. 
Cleaning up a contaminated oil patch involves either
excavating the soil and trucking it away, or fencing off the
area to keep people out, said John Evans, chief civil engineer
for Cannon Associates, a San Luis Obispo, California-based
remediation firm. 
California Cleaning 
In California, the third-biggest oil-producing state after
Texas and Alaska, state agencies and regulators have been
pushing oil companies to clean up old fields. 
Unocal Corp. was forced to spend $100 million to dig up a
half-mile of oceanfront and to demolish and rebuild eight blocks
of Avila Beach, California, starting in 1995 after subterranean
pipelines leaked crude, gasoline and diesel, said Evans, who
worked on the project. 
The cleanup stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, according to a Unocal
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A yacht
club, retail stores and pier had to be rebuilt at the company&#8217;s
expense. Unocal is now part of Chevron. 
At another former Unocal operation in California, the
state&#8217;s Department of Fish and Game, the water quality board and
the Department of Toxic Substances Control successfully sued the
company over contamination of the Guadalupe field 160 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, public filings showed. 
Kerosene Leaks 
The cleanup so far has cost $200 million to $300 million
since digging began in 1994, Evans said. Before the field was
shut in the mid 1990s, Unocal used kerosene to loosen deposits
of thick crude. The kerosene pipes leaked, polluting the soil
and flowing into the ocean, he said. 
Eglinton, the Exxon spokesman, said the Unocal cleanups in
California may have little in common with conditions in south
Texas. &#8220;These are two completely different places,&#8221; he said. 
In Pennsylvania, the state has responded to a boom in gas
drilling by Exxon and others with stepped-up inspections of well
sites. The intent is to ensure the holes are properly lined with
steel pipe and concrete to protect local water supplies from
chemicals used to penetrate rock formations and saltwater that
gurgles to the surface with the gas, said John Hanger, secretary
of the state&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection. 
Pennsylvania Scars 
&#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s had a long, long history with natural-
resources extraction, going back some 300 years with coal and an
oil industry that began in the 1800s,&#8221; said Hanger, who before
heading the agency was CEO of Citizens for Pennsylvania&#8217;s
Future, a non-profit group that promotes renewable energy and
conservation. &#8220;Those industries left some scars on the natural
landscape, and we&#8217;re still paying considerable sums of money to
repair some of that damage.&#8221; 
From the 1930s through the 1970s, the Kelsey field in south
Texas attracted hundreds of roughnecks, engineers and their
families. They lived in a work camp that had gardens, a school,
swim club and the Cactus Club snack bar that specialized in
wood-smoked barbecue, the Burnses said. 
Humble Oil and Texaco, which were subsumed into Exxon and
Chevron, drilled 555 wells on the ranch and laid thousands of
miles of pipe to funnel crude to refineries in other parts of
Texas. 
Poisonous Toads 
Today the Encinitos Ranch, which sprawls across parts of
three counties, is home to poisonous Marine toads and
rattlesnakes. The fat brown toads, when captured, are tossed
into a pond to prevent the household dogs from eating them and
dying; rattlesnakes are shot and hung over a fence for good
luck. The dogs have scars from fighting with coyotes. 
Stephen Burns, 39, wears a holstered handgun around the
ranch for protection against drug smugglers who avoid Border
Patrol agents prowling the highways by following pipeline routes
that crisscross the property. 
His wife, Elizabeth, estimates Exxon has damaged 12,000 to
14,000 acres of the 31,000 acres it holds under the 1935 lease
by burying wastes left by oil production and allowing byproducts
to leak into the soil. Chevron has damaged about 4,000 of the
7,100 acres it operates under a lease that dates to 1934, she
said. 
Her first clash with Exxon had nothing to do with oil. In
October 2006, police discovered that a Mexico-based drug cartel
was using the abandoned Cactus Club as a way-station for
couriers armed with machine guns. The authorities asked the
Burns to have Exxon tear it down. 
The company declined the family&#8217;s requests, Burns said. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil can&#8217;t comment on the alleged 2006 request as
we don&#8217;t have any information about it,&#8221; said Margaret Ross, a
spokeswoman. &#8220;There is no current request from the landowner.&#8221; 
Bubbling Road 
Burns began to focus on the decaying oilfield
infrastructure after a second wildfire in March 2008 scorched
most of the landscape, exposing the rusty pipes and other aging
equipment spanning the ranch. That same month, an asphalt road
on the ranch that ran alongside a former oil-storage site began
to bubble with petroleum gases. Burns said she complained to
Exxon and to the railroad commission. 
Four months later, she triggered a radiation sensor clipped
to the belt of a U.S. Border Patrol agent at McAllen Miller
International Airport before boarding a flight to Houston. The
agent determined the culprit was dirt on the soles of her boots
laced with old crude and chemicals tracked in from the ranch.
Since then, she said, she&#8217;s been calling and emailing the
railroad commission about twice a week with contamination
complaints. 
Addressing Concerns 
&#8220;Commission staff is in regular contact with Elizabeth
Burns and has been working with her since November 2008 to
address her concerns,&#8221; Nye said in an e-mailed statement. 
A &#8220;majority&#8221; of Burns&#8217; complaints have been &#8220;addressed
and resolved,&#8221; Nye said. The five that remain open involve
storage tank and pipeline leaks that the commission is
monitoring &#8220;to assure that cleanups are completed within a
reasonable time frame,&#8221; the spokeswoman said. 
After the Burnses complained, Exxon dug up the road, which
crossed a network of 44 pipelines. In October, a 9-foot deep
hole about the size of a two-car garage remained, with a pool of
brown muck at the bottom that had the smell and tell-tale
rainbow sheen of petroleum. 
Fifty yards from where the road once ran, Stephen Burns
used a backhoe to dig a 6-foot trench in the soil. Within
seconds, a clear liquid that reeked of motor fuel trickled down
the sides of the hole. A clump of the dirt felt and smelled like
the boggy sand that is mined for oil in Alberta, Canada. 
Exxon filled in the bubbling-road hole in December and
covered it with caliche, Burns said. 
Benzene Found 
The survey done in 2008 for the family found dangerously
high levels of petroleum derivatives such as benzene, as well as
mercury and lead, in soil and water samples from the surface to
at least 40 feet down. 
The family stopped using its tap water after seeing those
results. Now they get their water once a week in 5-gallon jugs
from a Farm and Ranch store in San Isidro, Texas, about 40 miles
away. 
Although lighter-weight hydrocarbons can degrade naturally
in 40 or 50 years, the heavier molecules &#8220;are more persistent
and pretty toxic,&#8221; said Gregory Miller, project manager at Icon
Environmental Services Inc., a Port Allen, Louisiana-based
company that cleans up old oilfields. &#8220;You have no idea how bad
some of these sites are.&#8221; 
Daunting Task 
Patterson said cleaning up a tract as large as the
Encinitos Ranch is impossible. Instead, the best solution may be
to fence it off and monitor the pollution to ensure it doesn&#8217;t
migrate underground to other ranches. 
&#8220;We need to somehow encapsulate it, monitor it, clean up
the obvious hazards, whether they&#8217;re fire hazards, whether
they&#8217;re leakage hazards,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you
can totally remediate that many acres. It&#8217;s not doable. It&#8217;s
just too big.&#8221; 
Exxon has installed water-monitoring stations at the ranch,
said Eglinton, the company spokesman. He declined to release the
results of the tests performed thus far. 
Oil companies would be better off cleaning up their old
operations in south Texas, Patterson said, rather than waiting
for regulators or the state legislature to impose a solution. 
&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s walked away from a lot of this stuff they built
here, but the evil lurks,&#8221; said Burns, who had planned to raise
organic vegetables when she and her husband moved to the ranch
with their sons five years ago. &#8220;You&#8217;d hope your kids can do
something with this land, but now it&#8217;s worthless.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. is near an
agreement to sell its Miramax film unit in a deal that would put
brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein back in charge of the studio
they founded, said a person with knowledge of the plan. 
The Weinsteins, who are working with billionaire Ron
Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa Cos., entered into exclusive negotiations with
Disney on April 16 as the sides work on a restructured proposal,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Their offer was increased to $625 million
from $600 million, the person said. 
A deal would reunite the Weinsteins, the executives behind
&#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; and Oscar winner &#8220;The English Patient,&#8221; with
the studio they named after their parents and left in 2005 to
start Weinstein Co. Disney would replenish its coffers after
paying more than $4 billion for comic-book publisher Marvel
Entertainment. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is focusing
the movie division on family oriented movies. 
Exclusivity lasts for less than a week, the person said.
Burbank, California-based Disney acquired Miramax in 1993 and
had sought $700 million for the studio and its 700-film library.
The Weinsteins earned 220 Academy Award nominations for Disney
during their tenure, for films including &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; &#8220;The Aviator&#8221; and &#8220;Life Is Beautiful.&#8221; 
Colbeck Capital Management and Fortress Investment Group
are providing funding for the Miramax offer, The New York Times
reported on April 16. The exclusive talks were reported earlier
by TheWrap.com. 
Gores Brothers 
Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman for New York-based Weinstein
Co., declined to comment. Frank Quintero, a spokesman for
Burkle&#8217;s Los Angeles-based Yucaipa, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, said in January
that it closed Miramax offices, and that it would distribute the
six remaining pictures. The Weinsteins founded the company in
1979 and named it after their parents, Miriam and Max. 
Alec Gores and Tom Gores, billionaires who each run Los
Angeles-based private equity companies, have raised their bid
above the $550 million originally offered, said one person. They
are being advised by their brother Sam Gores, owner of Paradigm
Talent Agency in Beverly Hills, California. 
A spokesman for the Gores, Michael Sitrick, declined to
comment. 
Hollywood film producer David Bergstein has also offered
about $650 million, according to two people with knowledge of
the bid. 
Bergstein is advising a &#8220;well-capitalized offshore
entity&#8221; on a Miramax bid, his Pangea Media Group said in on
April 8. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 57 cents to
$35.83 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on April 16.
Its shares have climbed 11 percent this year.

International Business Machines
Corp. said service contract signings fell last quarter,
suggesting corporate customers are still delaying some
technology spending following the economic slowdown. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Application-management
signings declined 23 percent. 
IBM shares have lagged behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index this year. The company, the world&#8217;s largest computer-
services provider, has yet to signal that its profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than by measures like cost cuts
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; said Marshall, who has a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock and doesn&#8217;t own it. &#8220;IBM is simply
not that attractive of a growth story right now.&#8221; 
IBM fell 2.2 percent to $129.35 in after-hours trading
after rising $1.60 to $132.23 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. It has gained 1 percent this year, compared with a 7.4
percent gain in the SP 500. 
Excluding the decline in application-management signings,
total services signings would have been up 4 percent from a year
earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s slower growth than the 9
percent increase in the fourth quarter. 
Stock Buybacks 
Since 2002, IBM has repurchased $68.5 billion of stock to
help buoy profit. The buyback program shows &#8220;really good
financial management from an earnings perspective,&#8221; Marshall
said. &#8220;At the end of the day -- not much upside from a revenue
perspective.&#8221; 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221;
and doesn&#8217;t own any. 
IBM has cut about 2,900 jobs this year, according to
advocacy group Alliance@IBM, which represents some employees.
That&#8217;s on top on the more than 10,400 let go in the U.S. and
Canada last year, the group said, as the company coped with a
drop in sales. 
2010 Forecast 
The company should benefit as technology spending climbs
1.7 percent this year, after a 3.1 percent last year, according
to a projection from Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest
chipmaker, lent support to that prediction last week by
forecasting second-quarter sales that topped estimates. 
Full-year profit at IBM will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share, the company said.
Analysts on average estimated $11.13 based on estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in higher-
margin software and services. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross
profit margins, the percentage of revenue left after production
costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Software and services now make up more than 80 percent of
total revenue, which was $95.8 billion last year. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. The U.S. government&#8217;s plan to put patient health
records online may spur more than $20 billion in spending,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.

It&#8217;s not just the profits that pile
up at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. So do the scandals. 
Over the last year, the bank has been beaten up in the
court of public opinion. Last week&#8217;s fraud charges from the
Securities and Exchange Commission merely added to the battering
its reputation has already taken. Most of us would rather own up
to working for a tobacco company, with subsidiaries in landmine
manufacturing, than have anything to do with Goldman. 
It is well on the way to becoming the world&#8217;s most hated
company. And yet, there is an interesting twist to this tale.
Among the people who probably matter to it most, Goldman Sachs
is doing better than ever. 
Smart, ambitious graduates are still sending in their CVs
as enthusiastically as ever. The big corporations still want the
New York-based firm on their side. And it posted record earnings
in 2009 while its stock price doubled. 
There is a lesson in that for Wall Street investment banks.
While spending millions on an army of public-relations officers,
reputation consultants and sponsorship managers, financial
institutions shouldn&#8217;t forget that people prefer their bankers
to be greedy and mean. Being known for having sharp teeth, along
with a nasty bark, won&#8217;t do you any harm. None of the scandals
has hurt its business. This latest one won&#8217;t be any different. 
Public Beating 
No one can have failed to notice the beating that bankers
have taken in public opinion in the past two years. Real-estate
agents have a better reputation for honesty, and parking
inspectors have a higher rating for fairness. 
No surprises there. The banks took huge and crazy risks,
got ordinary taxpayers to bail them out, then went straight back
to paying themselves massive bonuses as if nothing had happened.
If that doesn&#8217;t send your reputation straight into the gutter,
it is hard to know what will. 
There is plenty of statistical evidence to show banks have
plummeted in public esteem. In Harris Interactive&#8217;s latest
survey of corporate reputations in the U.S., the banks took a
hammering. Out of 60 companies, Goldman Sachs ranked 56th.
Citigroup Inc. was at 57th, while Bank of America Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. were also in the bottom 10. Only the
tobacco industry fared worse than finance. You can&#8217;t sink much
lower than that. 
That, however, is what Joe Public thinks. Among the
corporate and political elite the story is rather different. 
Top of Polls 
A British survey, conducted by the graduate-recruitment Web
site TargetJobs, asked 100,000 students which companies they
would like to work for when they graduate. Goldman Sachs topped
the poll for investment banks. All that terrible press, it
seems, hasn&#8217;t stopped young people wanting to get their feet
under a desk in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offices. 
Likewise, Fortune magazine recently published its annual
survey of the most-admired companies. Who topped the megabank
category? That&#8217;s right. Goldman Sachs. It was up from 15th to
eighth place in the all-industries ranking, ahead of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. 
Fortune canvasses the views of more than 4,000 executives,
directors and analysts to compile its list. It is a measure of
elite, not mass opinion. And in that narrow world, it appears
that the big banks haven&#8217;t suffered at all. 
The message couldn&#8217;t be clearer. An avalanche of bad
publicity hasn&#8217;t really dented Goldman&#8217;s reputation, or that of
any other major bank, either. 
Nasty and Tough 
There are two conclusions to be drawn from that. 
First, we like our banks to be aggressive and mean. Imagine
you were hiring a bodyguard or a divorce lawyer. Do you want one
who promises to be conciliatory, kind and consensual? Or one who
takes no prisoners? In reality, you want your team to be as
nasty and tough as possible. The same is true of investment
banking. As gangster rappers say, it pays to be bad. 
Second, although there is a lot of waffling about
reputation and corporate social responsibility, all that matters
is the ability to get the job done. The firm of Nero, Khan (as
in Genghis)  Capone would probably win a fair bit of business
as long as it got that Greek bond issue sold, or found someone
to unwind a position in Florida mortgage derivatives. 
There is a moral in that for the investment banks. 
They will all spend fortunes in the next couple of years
getting their images back in shape. If you happen to have an
orchestra you want sponsored, an orphanage that needs a new
wing, or a rare species that needs saving from extinction, this
is the right moment to send in a polite letter asking for a
donation. Don&#8217;t forget to mention how their generosity will
improve their public image. They will write out a check faster
than you can say &#8220;giant vampire squid.&#8221; 
Two Audiences 
But actually, for keeping the business going, there are
only two audiences that really count. 
While the banks can still attract the smartest, most
ambitious young talent out of the universities, and so long as
the people running big corporations still rate them, what the
general public thinks doesn&#8217;t matter much. 
And while the banks are repairing their images, it would
also be worth remembering that they don&#8217;t want to go too far in
the other direction. It won&#8217;t really do them any harm to be
known as nasty and greedy -- that is what bankers are there for.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Richard
Kinder and the private-equity firms that bought Kinder Morgan
Inc. in 2007 have gained at least 126 percent return on a pretax
basis from their $7.8 billion equity investment, according to
CreditSights Inc. 
Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle Group, American
International Group Inc., Riverstone Holdings LLC and Kinder co-
founder Richard Kinder, agreed to pay $14.4 billion for the
operator of North American oil and natural-gas pipelines in
August 2006. While the deal was struck at the height of the
leveraged takeover boom, it stands out as bondholders haven&#8217;t
taken losses, said Andy DeVries, a CreditSights analyst in New
York. 
&#8220;This LBO remains one of the most unique of the 2005-07
LBO boom,&#8221; DeVries wrote in an April 18 report. In August, he
calculated the buyout equity investment had gained 69 percent. 
Kinder Morgan is the general partner of Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership that
operates or owns an interest in more than 35,000 miles of
pipelines. Chief Executive Officer Kinder and other managers at
the firm contributed $2.9 billion of the $7.8 billion equity
investment. 
Larry Pierce, a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners spokesman,
and Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls seeking comment.

The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; 
The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. 
&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; 
The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; 
 Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. 
Citigroup, WaMu 
The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy. 
Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, in response to subpoenas and document requests has
provided information to the SEC and state attorneys general in
addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who collected reports from
it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for the company in New
York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. 
&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; 
The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. 
&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; 
The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. 
Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets 
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. 
The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. 
&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; 
The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. 
&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; 
More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. 
Magnetar Deals 
Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. 
Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. 
His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. 
Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. 
Not Insisting 
Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. 
While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; 
Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. 
&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. 
Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. 
The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. 
Synthetic CDOs 
CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. 
The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Cummings, DeFazio 
Democratic Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter DeFazio said today they would ask SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro to
review whether Goldman Sachs CDOs insured by American
International Group Inc. were improperly created. AIG, rescued
by the U.S. in 2008, covered $6 billion of assets through Abacus
deals. 
Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. 
The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. 
Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. 
One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. 
&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; 
The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; 
In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. 
Goldman Sachs Response 
ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. 
&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; 
Buyer Beware 
Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. 
&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; 
Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few. 
In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. 
The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. 
&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; 
&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; 
IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. 
&#8216;Far More Sophisticated&#8217; 
&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; 
Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. 
&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said.

The cost to protect against losses
on bank bonds jumped for the second day amid speculation that
U.S. fraud charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may trigger
similar probes or lawsuits and embolden lawmakers&#8217; efforts to
crack down on financial firms. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman reached the highest in two
months as U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to follow the U.S. Securities
Exchange Commission and start a probe, and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said her nation&#8217;s financial regulator asked the
SEC for details on its Goldman suit. Swaps on banks including
Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG jumped. 
&#8220;If these charges are damning enough to actually cause
some instability in the markets, nobody really believes Goldman
is the only one that might be guilty here,&#8221; said Brian
Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at broker-dealer
Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
The SEC last week said New York-based Goldman sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing that a hedge fund that was betting against
the debt had helped select underlying securities. Goldman said
in a statement last week that the charges are &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; CDOs pool bonds, loans and other fixed-income
assets into securities of varying risk and return. 
Bank Swaps 
Credit swaps protecting Goldman debt for five years jumped
7 basis points to 134 basis points after earlier trading as high
as 140 basis points, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.
It&#8217;s the biggest two-day increase in a year, CMA DataVision
prices show. 
Contracts on Citigroup jumped 16 basis points to 138,
Deutsche Bank rose 4.5 to 98, Morgan Stanley climbed 17 to 153
and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit rose 18 to 159,
CMA prices show. 
&#8220;The fear is that this will make regulations even tighter,
increase the potential for fines and other judgments and push
down bank profits in the near term,&#8221; said Jeffrey Burch, co-
head of global credit at Investec Asset Management in London. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
to the highest in four weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 1.8 basis point to a mid-price of 89.13
basis points as of 11:03 a.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
Legislative Outlook 
The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies rose 3 basis points to 82.9, Markit prices show. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
The Goldman Sachs suit may embolden lawmakers who want to
hold Wall Street firms accountable for the financial crisis that
sparked the worst recession since the Great Depression, said
John Anderson, head of credit at Gartmore Investment Management
in London. 
Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, released a
bill last week that would limit derivatives trading by
commercial banks, barring dealers in swaps from taking advantage
of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount lending window, emergency
liquidity functions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s
insurance and guarantee functions. 
&#8216;Red Meat&#8217; 
President Barack Obama said in his weekly address on radio
and the Internet that his plan to overhaul U.S. financial
regulation is the only way to prevent the &#8220;turmoil that ripped
through our economy over the past two years.&#8221;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The perception was that banks were returning to
profitability and that everything in the garden was rosy,&#8221;
Anderson said. &#8220;But Obama has set his sights on the banking
community, and the regulators want some red meat.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due in 2020 are the most-
traded U.S. corporate notes today, falling 1.03 cents on the
dollar to 98.56 cents to yield 178 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries as of 10:51 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data show. 
Citigroup said first-quarter profit more than doubled,
beating analysts&#8217; estimates as the global economic rebound
trimmed costs for bad loans and boosted revenue from consumer
banking. 
The bank&#8217;s 6.01 percent bonds due in 2015 fell 0.3 cent on
the dollar to 106 cents, a spread of 209.2 basis points, Trace
data show. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 5.5 percent notes due in 2020 declined 1.4
cent to 97.42 cents, a spread of 206.9 basis points, Trace data
show.

The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; 
The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. 
&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; 
The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. 
Citigroup, WaMu 
The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy before the market crashed. 
Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, has provided information to the SEC and state
attorneys general in addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who
collected reports from it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for
the company in New York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. 
&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; 
The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a
securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. 
&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; 
The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. 
Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets 
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by
John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. 
The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James
Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. 
&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; 
The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. 
&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; 
More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit,
Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. 
Magnetar Deals 
Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. 
Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. 
His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. 
Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. 
Not Insisting 
Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. 
While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; 
Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. 
&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. 
Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. 
The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. 
Synthetic CDOs 
CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. 
The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Aquarius 2006-1 
Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. 
The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. 
Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. 
One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. 
&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; 
The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; 
In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. 
ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. 
&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs Response 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; 
Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. 
&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; 
Default Swaps 
Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. 
The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. 
&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; 
&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; 
IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. 
&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob
Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; 
Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. 
&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s fraud suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may
trigger additional probes of collateralized debt obligations and
lead to stricter regulation, analysts and academics said. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages without
disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick
the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle. Investors
including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Germany&#8217;s IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about $1 billion from the trade.
Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. 
&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as other
financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously very
worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it could
well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry. Regulators
may probe other CDOs that lost money for investors and could
probe other investment banks involved in the business, Raul
Sinha, a London-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in
a report published today. The suit may also strengthen political
pressure for more regulation of derivatives and similar complex
financial structures, threatening earnings, analysts said.

Just how out-of-touch can Lloyd Blankfein be? 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive officer
vigorously denied the Securities and Exchange Commission fraud
suit filed Friday against his firm, calling the complaint
&#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; The company promised
to &#8220;defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
But head-in-the-sand denials will no longer work. If
Blankfein wants to save what is left of Goldman&#8217;s reputation,
and possibly his job, he should admit that the deal described in
the SEC complaint was wrong. Then, he should draw a very firm
line so that Goldman doesn&#8217;t deceive its customers again. 
As only someone from Mars doesn&#8217;t know by now, Goldman
allegedly sold collateralized debt obligations, or bonds backed
by mortgage securities, to institutional investors without
disclosing that the specific securities were handpicked by
hedge-fund manager John Paulson. Paulson was betting on the
securities to fall and, for that reason, structured the
securities to include losers -- not winners. 
For instance, he ordered that no bonds backed by Wells
Fargo  Co. mortgages be included in the pool because Wells
Fargo was one of the few mortgage lenders that stuck to sound
lending. 
Goldman says it had no idea whether the mortgage securities
would go up or down. Maybe. But the SEC complaint quotes a
Goldman employee, also named as a defendant, gleefully
chortling, &#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime
now.&#8221; By the time the deal closed, in April 2007, the subprime
market was already in trouble. Defaults were skyrocketing. And
by the following January, no fewer than 99 percent of the
mortgages in the CDO had been downgraded. 
&#8216;Paulson Portfolio&#8217; 
Goldman says it lost $90 million on the deal. If true, that
might be its strongest defense. 
However, Goldman&#8217;s investment forecast matters less than
its allegedly faulty disclosure. Internally, it referred to the
bonds at issue as &#8220;the Paulson portfolio.&#8221; But outside
investors weren&#8217;t told that this much-respected -- and much-
feared -- short-seller had selected the bonds, or even that he
was involved. Instead, Goldman recruited a neutral third party
to bless the deal, and investors were told that this party, ACA
Management LLC, had selected the mortgages. 
It might be that every fact in the SEC complaint is untrue,
in which case Blankfein is right to defend and I am dead wrong.
But the complaint is rich in detail, and builds on a book,
Gregory Zuckerman&#8217;s &#8220;The Greatest Trade Ever,&#8221; and on
exclusive reporting in the New York Times that laid out a
similar story. 
Looking Ugly 
If the SEC&#8217;s facts are true, the case is ugly for Goldman.
In capsule form: At Paulson&#8217;s urging, Goldman structured a
security so Paulson could short the mortgage market. Goldman
found patsies to take the other side, and Paulson paid the firm
a $15 million fee. 
Goldman&#8217;s behavior reminds me of NBC television, which in
1992 aired a video of a pickup truck explosion that turned out
to have been staged. After a lawsuit by General Motors Co., NBC
apologized on air. 
In the present case, Goldman staged a CDO to explode. 
Another example: in 1991, a Salomon Brothers trader lied to
the government. Though no investor fraud was involved, the CEO,
John Gutfreund, was forced to resign merely because he had
waited a few months before reporting the incident. The new
interim CEO, Warren Buffett, publicly apologized. He insisted
then that in the future Salomon Brothers would be &#8220;way, way
away from the line.&#8221; He wanted it to steer clear of any
behavior that was even remotely questionable, much less illegal. 
Word From Buffett 
Should Goldman aspire to any less? The same Buffett&#8217;s
Berkshire Hathaway is an investor in Goldman. It would be nice
to hear Buffett endorse his principles with respect to Goldman
now. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Berkshire.) 
Either way, Blankfein should deliver a public apology.
Stonewalling, dissembling or parsing the facts won&#8217;t restore
Goldman&#8217;s name. Goldman may also have to settle with investors
who lost money on this and any similar deals. It will cost
Goldman money but it will be worth it. 
Finally, Goldman needs to look in the mirror and ask how a
firm long known for its stellar reputation and ethics could have
gone so wrong. My own theory is that three steps in the firm&#8217;s
evolution eroded the class that Goldman once stood for. 
Going Public 
First, when the firm was sold, ending its days as a
partnership, in 1999, managers gradually began to think of
Goldman as a public stock rather than their private firm. 
Second, Goldman became more of a trader, less an investment
banker. Bankers think long-term, traders short-term. Last year,
76 percent of its revenue was from trading and for investing for
its own account. 
Finally, the shift toward trading was duplicated in
Goldman&#8217;s upper management, which formerly was divided between
both camps. Since Blankfein took over in 2006, traders have
dominated. 
Goldman, of course, will say it still cares about
reputation. Tell that to IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. In 2006,
the German bank specifically told Goldman it was no longer
comfortable investing in CDOs that didn&#8217;t &#8220;utilize a collateral
manager, meaning an independent third-party,&#8221; according to the
SEC&#8217;s complaint. Goldman told IKB it had such a manager -- ACA.
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson. IKB lost almost all of its $150
million investment. 
Goldman&#8217;s exploded CDO already may have changed the future
of Wall Street. The case seems certain to speed financial
overhaul legislation through Congress. The question is whether
that CDO will change -- or threaten -- the future of Goldman as
well.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. faces a
regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from the German
government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued the firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called April 17 for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for
details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel
said. 
Politicians who were forced to bail out banks during the
financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. 
&#8220;We will see politicians throughout the world piling on
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Scott Moeller, a former investment banker
now teaching at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;Now they have
vulnerability. Everyone and anyone, especially politicians, are
going to be trying to make hay with this one.&#8221; 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. 
The firm denies any wrongdoing. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs, and Heidi Ashley, a spokeswoman for the FSA,
declined to comment.

New Suits 
Goldman Sachs Sued by SEC for Fraud Tied to CDOs 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by U.S. regulators for
fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations that contributed
to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
firm&#8217;s shares tumbled as much as 16 percent and financial stocks
slumped. 
Goldman Sachs misstated and omitted key facts about a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market was starting to falter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement April 16. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president. 
&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said in the statement. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a
client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily
influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment
portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities
were selected by an independent, objective third party.&#8221; 
The SEC alleged that Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, structured and marketed CDOs that
hinged on the performance of subprime mortgage-backed
securities. The New York-based firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the selection of securities
for the portfolio, the SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas Van Praag didn&#8217;t return a
call and an e-mail seeking comment. A call to Richard Klapper,
an attorney for Goldman Sachs at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, wasn&#8217;t
returned. Tourre, reached by phone in London April 16, declined
to comment. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at
Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. 
Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for New York-based Paulson 
Co., said he couldn&#8217;t comment. The company oversees $32 billion.

Ex-Blackwater President Indicted on Weapons Charges 
The former president of Blackwater Worldwide Inc., the
military contractor now called Xe Services LLC, was charged with
illegal possession of machine guns and falsifying documents. 
Gary Jackson, 52, and four other former Blackwater
officials were indicted April 16 in federal court in Raleigh,
North Carolina. They are accused of using sheriff department
stationery to buy AK 47s and other guns for Blackwater&#8217;s
training facility to get around restrictions on the number of
fully automatic weapons permitted in their inventory. 
The indictment also charges the five with falsifying
documents to make it appear that weapons Blackwater gave the
king of Jordan and his entourage in 2005, during a visit to the
Moyock, North Carolina, training facility, were purchased by the
defendants. 
They are also accused of putting short barrels on rifles
for use in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Blackwater provided
security services for the U.S., without registering them as such
and obstructing an investigation into the altered weapons. 
Kenneth Bell, a lawyer for Jackson, and Stacy DeLuke, a
spokeswoman for Xe, didn&#8217;t return calls for comment. 
The case is U.S. v. Gary Jackson, 10-8, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of North Carolina (Raleigh.) 
Ex-Credit Agricole Banker Sues on Bonus Exchange Rate 
A former Credit Agricole SA banker responsible for
derivatives is suing over the exchange rate the bank used to
convert his bonus from euros to pounds. 
Peter Ollila, formerly an executive director in sales
covering derivatives and securitized products for Nordic
countries and Poland, is seeking at least $96,000, plus
interest, from the Paris-based bank, according to a London
lawsuit made public this week. 
Ollila, who worked for the bank from Feb. 1, 2008, until
Nov. 21, 2008, said he is owed 33,000 pounds ($51,000) because
Credit Agricole converted his 327,500-euro ($443,000) bonus
using 2007 exchange rates rather than 2008 rates. He is also
seeking a 33,865 euro deferred payment, which he said he never
received. 
&#8220;It was an implied term&#8221; of the contract that Credit
Agricole would determine the exchange rate &#8220;reasonably and in
good faith and that the defendant&#8217;s exercise of its discretion
would not be irrational or perverse,&#8221; Ollila said in the
lawsuit that was originally filed in March. 
A Credit Agricole spokeswoman in Paris didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment. 
The case is Peter Ollila v. Credit Agricole Corporate 
Investment Bank, claim no. 2010/893, High Court of Justice,
Queens Bench Division (London).

Miami Beach Hotel Developers Charged With Hiding Funds 
A pair of Miami Beach hotel developers were arrested and
charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service
by hiding more than $45 million in offshore accounts. 
Mauricio Cohen Assor and his son Leon Cohen Levy, who built
residential hotels under the Flatotel name, never told the IRS
about proceeds of the $33 million sale in 2000 of a New York
hotel, according to a complaint in federal court in Miami. Cohen
Assor also used offshore nominee accounts to hide the ownership
of a Swiss account at an international bank that held $45.6
million in 2004, according to the complaint. 
The men were arrested in New York April 15, the deadline
for filing federal tax returns for 2009, as the Justice
Department also charged seven former UBS AG clients with tax
crimes for hiding funds abroad. The developers were detained
after an initial appearance in federal court in Manhattan. 
The two also used bank accounts in the name of their
business, American Leisure Resorts, to fund a &#8220;luxury
lifestyle&#8221; for themselves and family members, according to the
complaint. They paid for &#8220;lavish personal residences, living

DynCorp Sued by Holder Over $1.5 Billion Cerberus Bid 
DynCorp International Inc., the defense contractor that has
helped train Iraqi police, was sued by a stockholder claiming
his shares are undervalued in a $1.5 billion takeover bid by
Cerberus Capital Management LP. 
DynCorp, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said in a
statement on April 12 it would be bought by the New York-based
investment fund for $17.55 a share in cash -- a 49 percent
premium at the time. 
&#8220;The proposed transaction is unfair and grossly
inadequate&#8221; and &#8220;Cerberus may be taking advantage of a
temporarily depressed stock price,&#8221; shareholder Shawn K. Naito
said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed April 16.
Lawyers for Naito ask a judge to stop the deal and award damages
and legal fees. 
Craig R. Reed, a DynCorp senior vice president, didn&#8217;t

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Merrill Used Same Alleged Fraud as Goldman, Bank Says 
Merrill Lynch  Co. engaged in the same investor fraud that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. of committing, according to a bank that sued
the firm in New York last year. 
Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, known
as Rabobank, claims Merrill, now a unit of Bank of America
Corp., failed to tell it a key fact in advising on a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation. Omitted was Merrill&#8217;s
relationship with another client betting against the investment,
which resulted in a loss of $45 million, Rabobank claims. 
Merrill&#8217;s handling of the CDO, a security tied to the
performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities,
allegedly mirrored Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct that the SEC detailed
in a civil complaint filed April 16. The SEC claims Goldman
omitted the same key fact about a financial product tied to
subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was starting to
falter. 
&#8220;This is the tip of the iceberg in regard to Goldman Sachs
and certain other banks who were stacking the deck against CDO
investors,&#8221; said Jon Pickhardt, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, who is representing Netherlands-based
Rabobank. 
&#8220;The two matters are unrelated and the claims today are
not only unfounded but weren&#8217;t included in the Rabobank lawsuit
filed nearly a year ago,&#8221; Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman,
said April 16 of the Dutch bank&#8217;s claims. 
Kenneth Lench, head of the SEC&#8217;s Structured and New
Products unit, said that the agency &#8220;continues to investigate
the practices of investment banks and others involved in the
securitization of complex financial products tied to the U.S.
housing market as it was beginning to show signs of distress.&#8221; 
In its complaint, the SEC said New York-based Goldman
Sachs, which had a record $13.4 billion profit last year, failed
to disclose to investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was
betting against the CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the
selection of securities for the portfolio. Paulson, which
oversees $32 billion and didn&#8217;t market the CDO, wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
The SEC allegations are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact, and we
will vigorously contest them,&#8221; Goldman said in a statement. 
SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on whether it
is investigating Merrill&#8217;s actions. 
The case is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
BA v. Merrill Lynch  Co, 09-601832, New York State Supreme
Court (New York County).

Rajaratnam Sought Tips on Berkshire&#8217;s Goldman Buys, U.S. Says 
Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, who faces federal
insider trading charges, sought to acquire secret information
about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008 purchase of preferred
shares in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., federal prosecutors said in
a court filing. 
A letter from federal prosecutors to Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers
detailing new allegations of insider trading was made public
April 16 in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. In it,
prosecutors elaborated on an earlier claim that Rajaratnam tried
to use confidential information to trade on Goldman Sachs stock. 
Rajaratnam &#8220;conspired to obtain material, nonpublic
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman Sachs&#8221;
before its public announcement of earnings in June 2008 and
December 2008, according to the letter. &#8220;In addition,
Rajaratnam conspired to obtain material, nonpublic information
about the purchase by Berkshire Hathaway of preferred stock in
Goldman prior to Goldman&#8217;s public announcement&#8221; on Sept. 3,
2008, prosecutors said. 
Lawyers for Rajaratnam are asking a judge to exclude
evidence of additional allegations of insider trading, saying
prosecutors waited too long to disclose it. 
The filing doesn&#8217;t identify Rajaratnam&#8217;s source for
information about Goldman Sachs. It does provide details about
other alleged efforts to obtain inside information. 
&#8220;The allegation is false,&#8221; said Jim McCarthy, a spokesman
for Rajaratnam. 
Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is the central figure
in a probe in which 21 people have been charged criminally. He
claimed prosecutors are &#8220;sandbagging the defense&#8221; in violation
of his constitutional rights, including the right to defend
himself at trial. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Bank Class-Actions Bid in U.K. Not Dead, BBA Says 
U.K. consumers are likely to get another chance to file
class-action lawsuits against banks after a clause allowing such
cases was dropped from legislation written to respond to the
financial crisis. 
The provision will probably be taken up by a new government
following the May 6 general election, according to Eric
Leenders, a director at the London-based British Bankers&#8217;
Association, which didn&#8217;t object to the bill. 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t going away,&#8221; Leenders said in a phone
interview April 16. &#8220;Whichever party comes into power will be
looking at some kind of collective proceedings. We have another
opportunity to think about how they could be constructed.&#8221; 
The Financial Services Bill became law on April 8, after a
clause allowing groups to sue financial services firms was
abandoned when lawmakers ran out of time to debate it before
parliament was dissolved ahead of the election. 
The clause was considered amid increasing complaints about
bank fees, which U.K. antitrust regulators were barred from
examining for fairness. The language would have allowed lead
plaintiffs in a case to file claims on behalf of unspecified
customers who would have then needed to opt out of the case. 
Rachael Mulheron, a Queen Mary University of London law
professor who helped draft court rules for the dropped
provision, also said the class-action law has a chance with the
new government.

Verdicts/Settlements 
U.K. Tobacco Makers and Retailers Fined $346 Million 
 Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Gallaher Group Ltd. and 10
retailers were fined 225 million pounds ($346 million) for
coordinating cigarette prices between 2001 and 2003, a U.K.
antitrust regulator said. 
Imperial, the maker of the West, Davidoff and JPS brands,
received the largest penalty of 112.3 million pounds, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trade said April 16 in a statement. Gallaher, a
unit of Japan Tobacco Inc., was fined 50.4 million pounds. The
fine is the largest of its kind by the regulator. 
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.&#8217;s Asda unit was fined 14.2 million
pounds and The Co-operative Group was fined 14.1 million pounds
for their roles in a price-fixing scheme that the OFT says
barred retailers from setting their own prices. The affected
markets are worth about 13 billion pounds, the regulator said. 
The OFT said it dropped allegations made in 2008 about the
relationship between the tobacco companies and Tesco Plc,
because it didn&#8217;t have enough evidence. The regulator also said
it abandoned claims relating to indirect exchanges of proposed
future retail prices. 
Imperial denied breaking any laws and said in a statement
it would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. Japan
Tobacco views the fine as a &#8220;positive&#8221; development since the
fine has been formally decided, spokeswoman Yuka Sugimoto said. 
William Morrison Supermarkets Plc said it would challenge
the fines, saying the OFT&#8217;s stance was &#8220;illogical and without
foundation.&#8221; Morrison was fined 2.45 million pounds and Safeway
stores, which it acquired, were fined 10.9 million pounds. 
 J Sainsbury Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest supermarket
owner, alerted the OFT to the price-fixing arrangement and was
the first to apply to the watchdog for leniency. The company
received full immunity from fines. 
Imperial hasn&#8217;t taken any provisions for the fine, and
&#8220;any appeal to the tribunal will lead to the suspension of the
fine,&#8221; Imperial Tobacco spokesman Simon Evans said April 16 in
a phone interview. 
Gallaher, Asda, First Quench, One Stop, Somerfield and TM
Retail were given reductions to their fines because they
admitted liability when they received the OFT&#8217;s so-called
statement of objections in April 2008.

Dewey  LeBoeuf Issues Bonds as Law Firms Search for Capital 
Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP said it raised money in a bond
offering, a rare action by a U.S. law firm. The New York-based
firm sold about $125 million in an offering, according to two
people familiar with the transaction. 
The 1,200-attorney firm used the private placement to
refinance existing bank debt, partner Richard Shutran said. He
declined to disclose the interest rate for the bonds, saying it
was more favorable than the firm&#8217;s bank loans.

Court News 
Oboe-Playing Judicial Artist Diane Wood Eyed for High Court 
Diane Wood and her colleagues on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago have philosophical differences. That
didn&#8217;t stop Judge Richard Posner, the court&#8217;s most outspoken
conservative, from officiating at her wedding when she married
for the third time in 2006. 
Wood has demonstrated a willingness to challenge her fellow
jurists without offending, say lawyers and clerks who have
observed her in court. Those attributes may be an asset as
President Barack Obama considers her to replace retiring Justice
John Paul Stevens on an often-divided U.S. Supreme Court. 
In 1995, Wood persuaded Posner and other jurists to rethink
the case of an Indiana inmate fighting his death sentence when
she asked whether anyone warned him about repeated federal
challenges. &#8220;Silence can mislead,&#8221; Posner later wrote,
reversing an earlier opinion joined by fellow judge Frank
Easterbrook. 
&#8220;That was an example of the art of judging,&#8221; said Tom
Brown, a former clerk for Wood who is a San Francisco lawyer.
&#8220;She asked the question in a way not to embarrass Judge
Easterbrook.&#8221; 
While Wood&#8217;s opinions supported abortion rights and
separation of church and state, her rulings on business matters
aren&#8217;t easy to pigeonhole. 
A 2000 decision favored Ameritech Corp. in a lawsuit filed
by consumers. Just days later, she upheld a Federal Trade
Commission finding that Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us Inc. improperly tried to use
its market power to keep the most popular toys out of warehouse-
style discount stores. 
&#8220;She may lean toward the liberal side on social issues,&#8221;
said Jeffrey Sarles, a partner at Chicago-based Mayer Brown LLP
who appeared before Wood on her first day on the bench. &#8220;On
business issues, she doesn&#8217;t seem ideological.&#8221; 
Wood, 59, who plays oboe in the Chicago Bar Association
Symphony Orchestra, said through her staff that she isn&#8217;t
commenting on her reported candidacy.

Court Filings 
Tribune Bankruptcy Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg System 
The bankruptcy docket of the Tribune Co. was the most-read
litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. 
Tribune filed bankruptcy in December 2008, one year after
real estate billionaire Sam Zell used more than $8 billion in
loans to take control of the publishing and television company.
The company&#8217;s newspapers include the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. 
Last week, Tribune filed a reorganization plan that would
reduce debt taken on during a 2007 buyout in exchange for giving
its lenders 91 percent of the bankrupt publisher. The plan,
filed April 12, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, reflects
the settlement Tribune reached with its main creditors. 
To read more about the reorganization plan, click here. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s stock
may drop and the board could come under pressure to change
managers after European politicians followed a U.S. fraud suit
with their own plans to scrutinize the firm, investors said. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority to start a probe, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Goldman Sachs.
Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details
on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. 
The escalating rhetoric adds urgency to efforts by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of his
board to stem the negative publicity. Although Goldman Sachs
vowed to fight the SEC case, calling it &#8220;unfounded in law and
fact,&#8221; the stock fell 13 percent on April 16. The shares rose
0.6 percent to $162.42 in European trading today. 
&#8220;The lynch-mob mentality that is prevailing right now
against Goldman is such that you don&#8217;t know where this thing
could go, so I think the stock is going to be under continuing
pressure,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4
billion as chairman of New York-based Holland  Co. &#8220;The board
actually has to pay attention not only to the legal niceties of
this thing but also to the franchise viability as well.&#8221; 
Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, said he sold his Goldman Sachs
stock on April 16 because the SEC suit brought the controversy
over Wall Street&#8217;s dealings in collateralized debt obligations
and credit-default swaps to a new level. 
&#8216;Investors Understand Fraud&#8217; 
&#8220;Investors understand that something complicated and
errant happened with CDOs and CDSs but they&#8217;re not sure entirely
what, because these collateralized debt obligations and credit-
default swaps are complicated and somewhat arcane,&#8221; said Farr,
whose firm manages more than $700 million in assets. &#8220;But
investors understand fraud, they get fraud really clearly.&#8221;
Samuel Robinson, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. 
Goldman Sachs, whose $13.4 billion profit last year was the
highest ever for a Wall Street securities firm, is facing an
unprecedented level of public opprobrium because of the
perception that it profited from practices that led to the
biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at the Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as
other financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously
very worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it
could well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; 
&#8216;The Bogey Man&#8217; 
Politicians that were forced to bail out their nations&#8217;
banks are turning on Goldman Sachs. The firm, which paid its
employees $16.2 billion last year, has become a target for
politicians like the U.K.&#8217;s Brown who are running in elections
or who, in the U.S., are battling over new financial regulation. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs will now become the bogey man for all
financial ills and I think it&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s not going away,
it is only likely to increase,&#8221; said Matt McCormick, an analyst
at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8
billion. &#8220;If you buy it at these levels you are hoping that
this is the worst of the bad news and I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the
case.&#8221; 
The European Union is probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in
arranging swaps for Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s
budget deficit. Congress has also examined the company&#8217;s
relationship with American International Group Inc., which got a
$182.3 billion U.S. rescue. 
Federal Case Assigned 
The SEC case against Goldman Sachs was assigned to U.S.
District Judge Barbara Jones in New York who presided over the
case of former WorldCom Inc. CEO Bernard Ebbers. Ebbers, who was
convicted in 2005 of overseeing one of the biggest frauds in
U.S. history, is serving a 25-year prison term. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter profit, due out tomorrow,
probably won&#8217;t help even though analysts expect earnings to rise
41 percent from a year earlier, McCormick said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to probably come out with great earnings,
at least that&#8217;s the expectation, but that is going to be quickly
discounted and drowned out,&#8221; he said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board of directors should do its own
investigation to ensure that it understands what senior
management knew about the issues raised by the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
said James Post, a professor of corporate governance and ethics
at the Boston University School of Management. 
&#8216;How Long?&#8217; 
&#8220;The board has got to be insisting on a much deeper level
of internal investigation that reports only to them, not to
Blankfein,&#8221; Post. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got to be asking the question &#8216;how
long can we continue going with Blankfein before we&#8217;ve got to
clean house and put a new group of people in there?&#8221; 
William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor who
has served on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board since 2002, referred a
request for an interview to the company&#8217;s press office. His
Twitter account, which lauded JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie
Dimon for his firm&#8217;s better-than-expected earnings on April 14,
remained silent on the controversy surrounding Goldman Sachs. 
Boston University&#8217;s Post said he wouldn&#8217;t expect the board
to take any immediate action to change the firm&#8217;s management
because it would seem to contradict the defiant position the
company took on April 16. 
&#8216;A Bad Weekend&#8217; 
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that the board at Goldman is having a bad
weekend,&#8221; Post said on April 18. &#8220;They may be praying for some
news out of the Vatican or a new volcano to get them off the
front pages.&#8221; 
Bahl  Gaynor&#8217;s McCormick said changing senior management
could add fuel to critics&#8217; complaints instead of mollifying
them. A better course, he said, would be to bring in a well-
respected Wall Street veteran, even someone like billionaire
Warren Buffett, to serve as a chairman or adviser to Blankfein.
Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is already one of the largest
investors in Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;I could see them bringing in an outside person, somebody
who is viewed by the Street as a wise sage that could come in
and give an outsider&#8217;s perspective&#8221; to advise Blankfein,
McCormick said. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to believe Goldman is going to
take care of this on their own.&#8221;

Widening probes of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may prompt a drop of as much as 10 percent in global
stock markets, according to AMP Capital Investors Ltd., a unit
of Australia&#8217;s biggest provider of pension plans. 
The MSCI World Index, as well as U.S. and Asian equity
gauges, are ripe for a &#8220;multi-month&#8221; correction after
valuations soared, said Nader Naeimi, a strategist who helps
oversee $90 billion for the Sydney-based mutual-funds manager.
AMP Capital last week began moving to cash assets from equities,
anticipating a decline in stocks, Naeimi said. The MSCI World,
which measures 23 developed markets, has rallied 43 percent in
the past 12 months. 
&#8220;The Goldman inquiries have triggered a fresh wave of
anxiety for investors,&#8221; Naeimi said in an interview today.
&#8220;Not only is the market worried who might be next, it&#8217;s
anticipating tighter regulation of the banking sector. Given how
over-bought stocks had become, this may be enough to trigger the
sharp correction in the overall market that we&#8217;ve been
expecting.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most-profitable Wall Street firm in
history, faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from
the German government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued the firm for alleged fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. 
Financial Stocks 
The MSCI World Index&#8217;s rally in the past 12 months has
driven the average valuation for companies in the gauge to 14.8
times estimated earnings, compared with 11.2 times at the
gauge&#8217;s March 9, 2009 low. The measure dropped 0.6 percent as
of 4:57 p.m. in Tokyo, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank
1.9 percent. 
Any correction is likely to hurt financial stocks in
particular, and could last for as long as six months, at which
point shares in Asian banks, which are generally less leveraged
than their U.S. and European counterparts, will look especially
attractive, AMP Capital&#8217;s Naeimi said. 
&#8220;Whenever the global financial sector is hit, there tends
to be guilt by association,&#8221; said Naeimi. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at
buying into Asian financials when we think the correction is
close to having run its course. Depending on relative valuations
at the time, you might well see us rotating out of developed-
world financial stocks into Asian ones.&#8221; 
U.K. Probe 
The strategist told a Bloomberg Television on April 14,
2009 that the &#8220;bear market&#8221; in global equities had ended. The
MSCI World Index finished the year with a 27 percent advance.
Naeimi also called a &#8220;correction&#8221; for the U.S. Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index on Oct. 16, 2009. The gauge dropped 5.6 percent
between Oct. 19 and Oct. 30. 
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry into Goldman,
saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated
in the suit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC
for details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela
Merkel said. 
Politicians who were forced to bail out their banks during
the financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. 
&#8220;The timing of the accusations against Goldman was perfect
for investors seeking to sell shares, since markets worldwide
had been overheating,&#8221; said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a strategist in
Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $66 billion.

A fraud suit by U.S. regulators
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is unlikely to send hedge funds
scrambling to reduce gold holdings, according to Superfund
Financial Singapore Pte. 
Any retreat in prices will present investors, especially
central banks, with a buying opportunity, Aaron Smith, managing
director of Superfund, said in an interview today. Gold for
immediate delivery was little changed at $1,136.57 an ounce at
11:57 a.m. in Singapore after slumping by the most in more than
two months on April 16. 
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t expect hedge funds to unwind their
positions,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Even if they do, I think central
banks, especially in the East, whether it&#8217;s India or China or
any central bank that is smart, will use it as an opportunity to
acquire gold at a cheaper level.&#8221; 
Goldman faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny
from the German government after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. The firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
instruments and influenced the selections in the portfolio, the
SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
As of Dec. 31, Paulson was the largest holder in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund back by the metal,
and Goldman was the 11th biggest. Both are based in New York.
Paulson is also the top investor in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.,
Africa&#8217;s largest producer of bullion. 
&#8216;Good Opportunity&#8217; 
Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions in New York gold futures in the week
ended April 13, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. 
Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 220,742 contracts on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-
long positions rose by 17,296 contracts, or 9 percent, from a
week earlier. 
&#8220;In the short term, there&#8217;s a possibility of a pullback
and we would recommend to any investor that&#8217;s a good
opportunity&#8221; to enter the market, Smith said. &#8220;In the long run,
the hard assets will have sustainable value and sustainable
purchasing power.&#8221; 
Gold rallied 24 percent last year as central banks and
governments maintained low interest rates and spent trillions of
dollars to stimulate economies, sending the dollar 4.2 percent
lower against six major currencies. Bullion has gained 3.6
percent this year. 
&#8220;If the upward trend in equity markets continues and
interest rates continue to stay low, we won&#8217;t certainly see a
large pullback in commodity markets,&#8221; Smith said. 
Central banks in Russia, China, India, Sri Lanka and
Mauritius have all increased their gold reserves. China has
expanded reserves by 76 percent to 1,054 metric tons since 2003,
the central bank said last year. India bought 200 tons from the
International Monetary Fund last year as gold prices soared and
the dollar weakened.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused
by regulators last week of fraud in its mortgage-securities
business, may show investors tomorrow whether its dominance of
Wall Street&#8217;s debt trading is being eroded by competitors. 
Analysts including Howard Chen at Credit Suisse Group AG
expect New York-based Goldman Sachs, which reports first-quarter
earnings tomorrow, to say revenue from fixed-income trading
dropped from $6.56 billion in last year&#8217;s first quarter.
Earnings last week from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co., the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, surged on record
first-quarter revenue from the business. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, relied on fixed-income trading for more than
half of revenue last year, helping the firm post record profit.
Competitors that lagged behind Goldman Sachs a year ago are
trying to catch up. Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on
April 21, hired more than 350 people last year to rebuild its
sales and trading business. 
&#8220;Competition appears to be returning, but it&#8217;s not
necessarily a zero-sum game as the overall market is growing,&#8221;
said New York-based Chen, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Global GDP is positive,
fixed-income issuance levels have been robust and client
liquidity levels seem healthy.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s competitors may see the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit against the firm as an opportunity to
grab market share. The SEC sued the firm for fraud on April 16,
saying Goldman Sachs misled investors in its marketing of
collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages.
Goldman Sachs said the allegations were &#8220;completely unfounded in
law and fact.&#8221; 
Dimon&#8217;s Outlook 
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts last week that he
didn&#8217;t expect his bank to be alone in reporting gains in trading
revenue because overall demand from clients has picked up. 
&#8220;It is a lot of client flow, so we&#8217;re not the only ones
who saw that,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to see other
people report similarly good numbers driven by client flow.&#8221; 
Of the six-biggest U.S. banks by assets, only Goldman Sachs
and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. are expected by
analysts to show a decline in profit in 2010 compared with last
year, when they both generated record earnings. 
First-quarter adjusted earnings at Goldman Sachs will
probably rise 54 percent from a year earlier to $2.55 billion,
or $4.14 per share, according to the average estimate of 23
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Gorman&#8217;s Goal 
James Gorman, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s new CEO, is expected to
report $1.1 billion in adjusted first-quarter earnings, or 57
cents a share, compared with a loss a year earlier, a Bloomberg
survey shows. Credit Suisse&#8217;s Chen expects Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
fixed-income trading revenue to rise to $1.95 billion from last
year&#8217;s $1.29 billion, which was damped by writedowns and
accounting adjustments related to the firm&#8217;s credit costs. 
&#8220;You listen to James Gorman on the call last quarter and
he&#8217;s very clear that we want to be top three in all of our
businesses,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;That would mean closing the gap in
fixed-income and equities trading.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment
about trading revenue. Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag
also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs gained 4.7 percentage points of market share
in fixed-income trading since the first half of 2007, more than
double the next-biggest climb of any of the top 14 banks, Keith
Horowitz, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an April 6 note
to investors. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s market share in fixed-income
trading fell 2.4 percentage points in that time, Horowitz said. 
&#8220;Ability to regain trading market share is the key to the
stock,&#8221; Horowitz wrote of Morgan Stanley. 
Analysts&#8217; Estimates 
Goldman Sachs will probably report $6.09 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue in the first quarter, down 7 percent from
a year earlier, Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman said in a
March 30 note. Morgan Stanley may report $1.94 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue, up 50 percent, Freeman said. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s first-quarter earnings surpassed estimates last
week in part because of $5.5 billion in fixed-income revenue
that set a record for the New York-based bank. Bank of America
said April 16 that revenue from fixed-income, currency and
commodity trading climbed 16 percent to $5.52 billion in the
first quarter, the most since the largest U.S. bank acquired
Merrill Lynch last year. 
UBS AG generated about $2.3 billion of revenue at its
fixed-income division in the first quarter, people with
knowledge of the situation said last month. The bank said that
figure was &#8220;slightly higher&#8221; than its forecast. Writedowns in
the first quarter of 2009 forced the Zurich-based company to
report negative revenue of 1.97 billion Swiss francs ($1.86
billion) for the period. 
&#8216;Normal Level&#8217; 
&#8220;Revenues you&#8217;re seeing now are probably more broadly
based,&#8221; said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities LLP. &#8220;Bid-offer spreads have come down to a more normal
level, but you&#8217;ve seen a pickup in client activity across a
number of different sectors, so I think we&#8217;re getting more
toward a normal environment.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs generated $23.3 billion in revenue from sales
and trading in fixed-income, currencies and commodities, more
than half of the firm&#8217;s total revenue last year. That
performance helped drive the firm to the largest profit in Wall
Street history just one year after reporting its first quarterly
loss as a public company. 
Morgan Stanley generated $5.02 billion of fixed-income
sales and trading revenue as it ramped up risk at a slower pace
than Goldman. The firm replaced its sales and trading chief,
Mitch Petrick, and its head of interest-rate trading, Roberto
Hoornweg, and has been hiring to revive the business. 
Debt Spreads 
Charges related to the firm&#8217;s debt spreads that reduced
fixed-income trading revenue by $3.3 billion in 2009 &#8220;are
largely behind&#8221; it, Gorman said this month in a letter to
shareholders. 
Still, 12 analysts have cut their estimate for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s first-quarter earnings in the past four weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average adjusted
earnings per-share estimate fell 13.8 cents in that period, the
data show. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is trying to become more diversified by
expanding its retail brokerage, but trading revenues remain the
key factor driving their results,&#8221; Staite said. 
Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 4.8 percent this year,
including a 13 percent decline on April 16 when the fraud
allegations were announced. Morgan Stanley has dropped 1.5
percent in 2010, after gaining gained 85 percent last year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
U.S. fraud case against the firm hinges on the actions of the
employee it placed on paid leave this week. 
Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about a
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will also be de-registered
from the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm
in London said yesterday. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; 
By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publically distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. 
Goldman Sachs may also want to separate itself from Tourre
if it&#8217;s concerned he will cooperate with the SEC or implicate
more senior employees, said Onnig Dombalagian, a professor at
Tulane University Law School in New Orleans and former attorney
fellow at the SEC.

Bank shares in countries such as
China and India, which have outperformed global rivals by about
30 percentage points since the &#8220;Lehman shock,&#8221; may extend
their advantage amid fraud probes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
The CHART OF THE DAY shows MSCI&#8217;s financials indexes for
emerging-markets in Asia and worldwide starting from Sept. 15,
2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
The bottom panel compares the gauges&#8217; weighted estimated
earnings, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman was sued
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16.
Asia&#8217;s emerging markets as defined by Morgan Stanley for its
indexes include China, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
&#8220;Asian emerging-market financial stocks will continue to
outperform,&#8221; said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees
$11 billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot less volcanic eruption in Asian
financials compared with Western financials, which face
increasing regulation and sovereign-debt issues.&#8221; 
The financial crisis in 1997 caused Asian banks to be
&#8220;more prudent,&#8221; allowing them to strengthen balance sheets,
said Do. That crisis, triggered by plunging currencies, forced
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea to seek International
Monetary Fund aid. Asia&#8217;s emerging-market countries have about
$3.7 trillion in reserves, almost half the global total. 
&#8220;Asian banks in general have more healthy balance sheets,
and their loan growth so far has been recovering quite well
versus still-negative loan growth in U.S. and European banks,&#8221;
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based vice president of investment
services at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which manages about
$102 billion in Asia-Pacific assets. 
The SEC suit against Goldman linked to collateralized debt
obligations may also trigger stricter scrutiny from European
regulators. The U.K. Financial Services Authority said it will
investigate Goldman Sachs International. The European Union is
also probing the bank&#8217;s role in arranging credit swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit.

U.S. Senate candidate Alexi
Giannoulias pushed his Republican opponent in Illinois to give
back donations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. without saying
whether President Barack Obama should return almost $1 million
that bank employees contributed to his White House bid. 
Obama, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Mark Kirk, the congressman competing against Giannoulias
for the seat once held by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from
Goldman employees, the center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are
Democratic Congressman Michael McMahon of New York, Republican
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, and three other New York
Democrats: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Representative Scott
Murphy and Senator Charles Schumer. 
&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement.

Allegations that Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. deceived its customers have done little to hurt Wall
Street&#8217;s stock recommendation, the most bullish since 2005. 
Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. reiterated &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-based
company since April 16, when the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a fraud suit that has sent the shares down 11
percent. Twenty-two firms advise that clients purchase Goldman
Sachs, which today reported first-quarter profit excluding some
items that beat the average analyst estimate by 35 percent. One,
Oppenheimer  Co., downgraded the stock since the claims were
announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Analysts are speculating Goldman Sachs will preserve its
reputation and benefit from an expanding economy that helped
lift its shares 208 percent since November 2008. The stock
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday after two people with knowledge of
the vote said the SEC split 3-2 along party lines to approve the
enforcement action, before falling 2.1 percent today. 
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sell any,&#8221; said Stephen Lieber, chief
investment officer of Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, which
manages more than $7 billion, including Goldman Sachs shares,
from Purchase, New York. &#8220;Do we have sufficient information to
provide an overall take at this point? No. The underlying
business of Goldman Sachs remains a suitable investment.&#8221;

Illinois, New Jersey and Texas are
among municipal-bond issuers sticking with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to underwrite pending debt sales after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission charged the firm with fraud. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re innocent until proven guilty,&#8221; said James Fuller,
chief financial officer of Georgia&#8217;s Municipal Electric
Authority in Atlanta, which borrowed $2.5 billion in early March
using banks led by Goldman. &#8220;People have to have their day in
court.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was the fifth-largest senior underwriter of
municipal debt last year, handling about $34 billion, according
to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. It was accused by the SEC
on April 16 of creating and selling collateralized debt
obligations tied to subprime mortgages in 2007 without
disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities. It also didn&#8217;t say that Paulson bet
against the securities, the SEC said. 
Goldman will remain a co-senior manager on an $851 million
fixed-rate issue for New Jersey&#8217;s Economic Development Authority
scheduled for as soon as this week, said Andrew Pratt, a
spokesman in Trenton, New Jersey, for Treasurer Andrew Eristoff,
a Republican. Goldman is co-senior manager with New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch  Co. will manage the sale. 
&#8220;Until it actually is fined or loses its lawsuit, it would
be very, very premature to eliminate them from a bond
transaction,&#8221; Pratt said in a telephone interview. 
Illinois Sale Coming 
Illinois plans to keep Goldman as an underwriter for coming
bond sales, John Sinsheimer, director of capital markets, said
in an interview from Chicago. So will the North Texas Tollway
Authority on a deal coming in May, Sherita Coffelt, a
spokeswoman based in Plano, Texas, said in an e-mail. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. The firm said in
a statement that the SEC&#8217;s allegations were &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs today reiterated its denial that it misled
investors and reported that net income rose 91 percent in the
first quarter to $3.46 billion, beating analyst estimates. The
shares slid $3.34, or 2.1 percent, to $159.98 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have declined 5.2
percent since Dec. 31. 
Georgia&#8217;s Fuller was among officials saying they would take
a closer look at Goldman Sachs if it were to lose the SEC case
or be found to have committed wrongdoing. 
&#8216;Unacceptable&#8217; 
If the allegations &#8220;are substantiated, they&#8217;re
unacceptable,&#8221; and could prompt the state to review its
relationship with the firm, said Washington State Treasurer
James McIntire. Goldman was lead underwriter on $503.4 million
of Build America Bonds for the state in October. 
&#8220;We have concerns about the lawsuit,&#8221; McIntire, a
Democrat, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Transparency is an
important issue. It affects the whole marketplace. We expect our
underwriter to be a partner, not an adversary.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, has made $55.7 million of fees from $36.4
billion of Build America Bonds sales, about a third of what it
earned from its municipal business, the company said in a March
1 response to queries from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an
Iowa Republican. 
Connecticut Review 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office has begun a preliminary review for a possible state
investigation of Goldman related to the SEC&#8217;s action. 
&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s allegations read like a Sopranos episode,&#8221;
Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in an April 16 statement, referring
to a crime family at the center of a U.S. television series. 
California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, a Democrat, is also
looking into whether Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street
underwriters promoted derivative trades to clients that would
have enabled them to bet against the state. The state is
reviewing the responses to questions sent to the firm last
month, said spokesman Tom Dresslar, based in Sacramento. He
declined say what steps California may take. 
&#8220;We have questions about how Goldman Sachs and other big
banks have been treating their clients -- the taxpayers of the
state of California,&#8221; said Dresslar. &#8220;The basic question is:
The taxpayers of this state are paying you guys hundreds of
millions of dollars to sell their bonds; to what extent are you
either betting against those bonds or facilitating bets against
those bonds?&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. fell the most since February in New York trading after
reporting a drop in service signings, signaling corporate
spending on larger technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
total sales, fell about 2 percent to $12.3 billion in the first
quarter, IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
said yesterday. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. 
IBM still hasn&#8217;t signaled to shareholders that profit can
rise based on sales growth rather than steps like costs cutting
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. Investors are seeking faster
revenue growth as the economy begins to recover, he said. 
&#8220;IBM is simply not that attractive of a growth story right
now,&#8221; said Marshall, who rates the shares &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own them. &#8220;Really good financial management from an
earnings perspective. At the end of the day, not much from a
revenue perspective.&#8221; 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said in
its earnings statement. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $2.54, or 1.9 percent,
to $129.69 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, its steepest drop since Feb. 4. It is little changed
this year, compared with an 8.3 percent advance in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Corporate Spending 
Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler,
who recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; 
Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. 
IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
risen 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. 
Second-Quarter Outlook 
Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. 
IBM said profit this year will be at least $11.20 a share,
up from a previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts
predicted $11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, spent the past decade
selling off hardware businesses and investing in its higher-
margin software and services units, which now make up more than
80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross profit
margins, the percentage of sales left after production costs,
for 10 quarters on a year-over-year basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported that net income
almost doubled in the first quarter and said it didn&#8217;t mislead
investors. 
&#8220;This all seems to be at root about whether someone
intentionally misled someone, and that&#8217;s not something we would
approve of or sanction,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Co-General Counsel Greg
Palm told analysts on a conference call today. He spoke after
the firm said earnings jumped 91 percent to $3.46 billion, or
$5.59 a share, surpassing analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, is fending off regulatory claims while cementing its
position as the most profitable investment bank in Wall Street
history. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm
of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, helped select the underlying assets. 
Goldman Sachs had &#8220;no incentive&#8221; for the deal to fail,
and lost more than $100 million on the transaction, Palm said.
The firm was &#8220;somewhat surprised&#8221; when the SEC filed its suit
on April 16, as &#8220;no one had told us in advance,&#8221; he said. 
Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the suit today,
saying in a statement announcing earnings that &#8220;in light of
recent events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of
our clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment
of our people.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. failed to ensure proper
monitoring of patients and their side effects in a clinical
trial, U.S. regulators said today. 
The Food and Drug Administration posted a warning letter on
its Web site today outlining &#8220;significant violations&#8221;
discovered during an inspection of a Pfizer clinical trial site
from May 4 to June 3. The letter, dated April 9, was redacted to
remove the name of the medicine and the study. Pfizer
spokeswoman Kristen Neese said the study involved tests of the
company&#8217;s bipolar disorder treatment Geodon for use in children. 
While Pfizer was warned by the agency in 2005 over lack of
study monitoring that led to widespread overdoses, follow-up
inspections in 2006 and 2007 also found dosing errors, the FDA
said in the documents. The agency ordered the New York-based
drugmaker to respond within 15 days with a plan to ensure that
its studies comply with federal regulations. 
&#8220;Pfizer has communicated with the FDA about our conduct of
clinical trials and, over the next two weeks, will provide an
outline of new and existing processes for preventing similar
issues with Pfizer clinical trials in the future,&#8221; Neese said
in an e-mail today. 
Pfizer fell 3 cents to $16.76 at 4:05 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 7.9
percent this year. 
Geodon&#8217;s Heart Impact 
Geodon prolongs the heart&#8217;s electrical cycle. Short-term
studies suggest children are sensitive to these changes in the
heart and may be more susceptible to potentially deadly
arrhythmias, according to an FDA staff review. Outside advisers
to the agency backed pediatric use in June, with most members
calling for more testing to evaluate the risks. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s Abilify and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s
Risperdal, now generic, were cleared for pediatric use in 2007.
Doctors treating children sometimes prescribe other
antipsychotics that aren&#8217;t approved for pediatric use. 
Children ages 7 to 17 accounted for 11 percent of Geodon
use in 2008, according to data posted on the FDA&#8217;s Web site
before the advisory panel meeting. While doctors are free to
prescribe the drug for this unapproved use, Pfizer isn&#8217;t
permitted by the FDA to promote the medicine to treat children. 
Geodon is approved for adults with schizophrenia and manic
episodes of bipolar disorder.

Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent,
bolstered by sales in Latin America. 
Net income increased to $1.61 billion, or 69 cents share,
in the quarter ended April 2 from $1.35 billion, or 58 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. 
Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.53 billion, the company said.
Eight analysts predicted $7.72 billion, on average. Global sales
by drink volume grew 3 percent, helped by a 4 percent increase
in Latin America. Sales by drink volume in North America
declined 2 percent. 
Coca-Cola is seeking to boost revenue and volume as
consumers recover from a global recession. Sales have bounced
back faster in emerging markets than in larger markets including
the U.S., Coca-Cola said.

Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 8.3 percent. PepsiCo plans to announce
first-quarter earnings April 22. 
Earnings excluding some items totaled 80 cents a share,
Coca-Cola said. Analysts predicted 74 cents, the average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
The company also named Steve Cahillane, president of Coca-
Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North America unit, to run a new
bottling and foodservice division when it combines with Coca-

Cahillane, who joined Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2007, will
become president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola expects to complete the purchase of CCE in the

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
is among at least three companies being investigated as part of
a U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe of bidding at
municipal tax-lien auctions in New Jersey. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Xspand unit and Vienna, Virginia-based Mooring
Tax Asset Group received grand jury subpoenas last year,
according to an August prospectus for New York City tax-lien
bonds that are serviced by the firms. Two units of Royal Bank
America were subpoenaed, its parent, Royal Bancshares of
Pennsylvania Inc. said in a March 2009 regulatory filing. 
New Jersey municipalities auction about $100 million a year
in tax debts on commercial and residential property to
investors, said Vincent Belluscio, executive director of the
state tax collectors and treasurers association. Antitrust
officials are probing whether investors colluded to limit
competition on sales to win a higher return, he said. In New
Jersey, the liens can carry annual interest of as much as 18
percent. The auctions are designed so that investors bid down
the interest rate they&#8217;re willing to accept. 
&#8220;The problem is these investors have a tendency to meet in
the hallway before a sale and divvy up the list,&#8221; Belluscio
said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;We&#8217;ll buy these properties, and you buy
those.&#8217; And the interest rate holds at 18 percent.&#8221; 
Belluscio said his information comes from a tax collector
who was visited by a federal investigator. 
Lien Buyers 
Cities and towns in New Jersey and 27 other states sell tax
debts to investors to raise cash and help plug budget deficits.
Some of the debts are packaged into bonds and sold. Tax-lien
buyers also get the right to collect penalties imposed on
delinquent taxpayers by governments, and have first priority to
take possession of properties when the owners don&#8217;t pay their
taxes. 
About $5 billion of property-tax delinquencies are sold
each year, Xspand officials told the Unified Government
Commission of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas,
according to a transcript of the Nov. 25 meeting on the
municipality&#8217;s Web site. 
In Florida, $1.8 billion of the liens were sold last year,
making it the largest property-debt auction market in the U.S.,
according to Plantation, Florida-based RealAuction.com, which
conducts online tax sales in counties throughout the state. 
Expensive Cost 
&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s concerned,&#8221; said Adam D. Greenberg, managing
partner of law firm Honig  Greenberg in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, whose clients include tax-lien investors. &#8220;Even if
you&#8217;re innocent, just responding to an investigation is
expensive.&#8221; 
Greenberg said he knows of other investors who received
subpoenas, though he declined to identify them or say if they
are clients. 
Justin G. Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment, as did Mark Sanders, a spokesman for Narbeth,
Pennsylvania-based Royal Bank, whose Crusader Servicing Corp.
and Royal Tax Lien Services LLC units are subjects of the probe. 
&#8220;Anybody who is a significant buyer in New Jersey has been
subpoenaed,&#8221; said John M. Jacquemin, president and founder of
Mooring Financial Corp., which has managed and serviced more
than $1 billion in delinquent tax liens since starting Mooring
Tax Asset Group in 1997. &#8220;We certainly were not involved with
any collusion.&#8221; 
Training to Prevent 
Mooring for at least eight years has trained its bidders on
the company policy against anti-competitive behavior and
requires them to sign statements confirming that they understand
the expectations, he said. 
Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, declined to comment. 
Xspand, which was founded by former New Jersey Governor
James Florio in 2000, was acquired by Bear Stearns Cos. six
years later. Also known as Plymouth Park Tax Services, it became
part of JPMorgan when the New York-based bank took over Bear
Stearns in 2008 to prevent a collapse. 
Xspand, based in Whippany, New Jersey, effectively stopped
participating in open-outcry auctions about nine months ago, a
person familiar with the decision said. It had become the
largest tax-lien investor in the U.S., buying $2 billion of
public debt across the country since 2008, The New York Times
reported Aug. 18. 
The company continues to service tax liens and bid on them
in Internet auctions and bulk sales by municipalities, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because of the
investigation. 
Florio Unaware 
Florio, who sold his Xspand interest in 2006, said he
wasn&#8217;t aware of the Justice Department investigation. Tax-lien
sales were heated when he ran the company, he said in an April
16 telephone interview. 
&#8220;It was very, very competitive,&#8221; he said. 
Paul V. Scura, who founded Xspand with Florio and left when
Bear Stearns took it over, said Xspand employees got thorough
training on avoiding anticompetitive behavior. 
&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine any of the employees of Xspand doing that
given how they&#8217;ve been sensitized to the importance of this
issue,&#8221; Scura said in an April 19 telephone interview. 
Last June, Harvey M. Nusbaum and Jack W. Stollof were
indicted in federal court in Maryland for conspiring to rig tax-
lien bids at auctions in the state. Nusbaum and Stollof and
others &#8220;agreed among themselves which of them would bid on
specific tax liens or groups of tax liens, and agreed upon
specific prices to be bid in certain auctions,&#8221; according to a
June 16 statement by the Justice Department. 
Plea Agreement 
Nusbaum entered a plea agreement and Stollof pleaded guilty
early this year. 
&#8220;With so many homeowners struggling these days, it is more
important than ever that all aspects of real estate
transactions, including tax-lien auctions, remain competitive
and free from collusion,&#8221; Scott D. Hammond, deputy assistant
U.S. attorney general for criminal enforcement of the
department&#8217;s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement
last June.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is
facing a fraud suit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over its sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
tried to get rid of its portion of the deal, a lawyer for the
firm said. 
&#8220;I believe we did attempt to see if there was any other
interest on the other side of the transaction,&#8221; Greg Palm,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said today on a conference
call with reporters when asked if the New York-based firm had
tried to sell its stake in the &#8220;super-senior&#8221; debt. 
Goldman Sachs said it lost more than $100 million on the
Abacus 2007-AC1 collateralized debt obligation that is at the
center of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit, including $83 million related to
its piece of the super-senior debt. The regulator says the firm
failed to explain to buyers of the CDO that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet on the CDO failing, had helped select
the assets underlying the security. 
Earlier today, on a conference call with analysts, Palm
said the company&#8217;s decision to own some of the CDO showed it had
confidence in the deal. 
&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have taken on this risk if we believed there
was something wrong in this transaction, we wouldn&#8217;t have put
our skin in the game in that way,&#8221; Palm said. 
Also on today&#8217;s call with reporters, Palm said the firm and
its representatives haven&#8217;t had discussions with the Department
of Justice on the case involved in the SEC matter or on any
similar issues. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had no discussions with the DOJ,&#8221; Palm said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., being
sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims
that it deceived investors about one of its financial products,
tried to fend off regulators last fall by arguing it had a duty
to keep the information confidential. 
The company failed to disclose that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., run by billionaire John Paulson, helped pick the underlying
securities in a collateralized debt obligation and then bet
against them, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed April 16. After
being told in July 2009 that the SEC planned to bring a
complaint, New York-based Goldman Sachs argued it had been
compelled to keep Paulson&#8217;s role secret. 
The SEC&#8217;s &#8220;proposed theory ignores the fact that, as a
broker-dealer acting as an intermediary on behalf of a client,
Goldman Sachs had a duty to keep information concerning its
client&#8217;s (Paulson&#8217;s) trades, positions and trading strategy
confidential,&#8221; the company said in a Sept. 10, 2009, document
addressed to the agency. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable company in Wall Street
history, created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages in
2007, using ACA Management LLC, a firm that analyzes credit
risk, to select underlying securities. Goldman Sachs knew that
at least one prospective investor, Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t likely to invest in a CDO that
didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager to analyze and select the
portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. Goldman Sachs misled
investors by not disclosing that Paulson had a hand in picking
the portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported first-quarter
earnings that surpassed analysts&#8217; estimates on record fixed-
income trading revenue. 
Net income almost doubled to $3.46 billion, or $5.59 a
share, from $1.81 billion, or $3.39, a year earlier, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate
of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $4.14 per share.
Predictions ranged from $3.33 to $5.97. 
The results showed Goldman Sachs maintained its dominance
in fixed-income trading, the biggest source of Wall Street&#8217;s
revenue. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is trying to
preserve the bank&#8217;s place as the most profitable investment bank
in Wall Street history while defending it against regulators&#8217;
claims that the company misled investors in 2007. 
&#8220;Goldman is continuing to take market share, and I think
that&#8217;s the key move for them coming out of the financial
crisis,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investment
LLC, which manages $5 billion, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;Goldman is a clear winner as people are trying to
figure out who they are going to do business with.&#8221; 
Shareholders said concern about potential fallout from the
accusations would supersede news about earnings. The stock,
which fell 13 percent after the SEC filed its case on April 16,
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday on news that the SEC was split
over whether to file the suit. The shares rose to $163.45 at
7:48 a.m. from $163.32 at the close on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday. 
SEC Case 
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, played a part in selecting the underlying
assets. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest&#8221; the case. 
Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the SEC&#8217;s
lawsuit in today&#8217;s statement, saying only, &#8220;In light of recent
events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of our
clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment of
our people.&#8221; 
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, will address
the SEC&#8217;s complaint in a conference call today, the company said
in a statement yesterday. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
will discuss earnings, the company said. 
Bank&#8217;s Reputation 
Ralph Cole, a senior vice president in research at Ferguson
Wellman Inc., is among investors who said they are concerned the
case could hurt Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation and cause clients to
switch their business to other firms. Another worry is that the
case could lead to additional lawsuits against the bank and add
impetus to financial-reform efforts that would erode Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s earnings potential. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the cost of this one suit&#8217;s the big deal,
not certainly compared to what they make,&#8221; said Cole, whose
firm manages $2.6 billion including Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It&#8217;s
what does this do to their reputation and what does this do to
the industry because of the current legislation going through?&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said revenue from fixed-income, currencies
and commodities trading, which contributed more than half of
revenue last year, rose 13 percent in the first quarter to an
all-time high of $7.39 billion from $6.56 billion. That beat
estimates for $5.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit Suisse
Group AG and $6.09 billion from Roger Freeman at Barclays
Capital. 
Bank of America 
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, both reported record fixed-income
revenue last week of $5.52 billion and $5.46 billion
respectively. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at a great year for capital markets
firms,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of Second Curve Capital LLC and
founder of bankstocks.com, said yesterday. 
Equities-trading revenue rose 18 percent to $2.35 billion
from $2 billion a year earlier, Goldman Sachs said. Gains from
principal investments, which includes the company&#8217;s stakes in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. as well as real
estate and other companies, were $510 million compared with a
net loss of $1.41 billion in the first quarter of 2009. 
Investment-banking revenue climbed 44 percent to $1.18
billion from $823 million last year. Within that, fees from
financial advice fell 12 percent to $464 million from $527
million and equity-underwriting revenue surged to $371 million
from $48 million. Debt underwriting generated $349 million
compared with $248 million a year earlier. 
Compensation and benefits, the firm&#8217;s biggest expense,
increased 17 percent to $5.49 billion in the quarter, or 43
percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost compared with
$4.71 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when the firm set
aside 50 percent of revenue.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s problems
with the Securities and Exchange Commission are spilling over
into the U.S. midterm elections. 
Congressman Mark Kirk, the Republican nominee for an open
Senate seat in Illinois, said he will return contributions made
by Goldman employees because the SEC is investigating the bank. 
Kirk, 50, made the announcement after his Democratic
opponent, Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, criticized him
for taking the donations. The two men are vying for the Senate
seat once held by President Barack Obama that will help
determine whether Democrats retain control of the chamber. 
&#8220;We are calling on Congressman Kirk to explain why he
voted against Wall Street reform,&#8221; said Matt McGrath, a
spokesman for Giannoulias. &#8220;And we are challenging him to give
back his tainted Goldman Sachs campaign contributions.&#8221; 
Kirk has taken $54,010 from Goldman employees, including
$21,600 for his Senate bid, McGrath said. 
The congressman said that his campaign is still determining
how much Goldman employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. 
&#8220;I want to set an example on ethics for others to
follow,&#8221; Kirk said yesterday during a Chicago news conference.
&#8220;I will err on the side of caution and watch this case
unfold.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. said signings of first-quarter service contracts fell,
signaling that spending on larger technology projects may not
pick up until the second half of the year. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
total revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, IBM,
the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, said yesterday
in a statement. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. 
Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler, who
recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York fell 2.2 percent to $129.38
in late trading yesterday after rising $1.60 to $132.23 on the
New York Stock Exchange. It had gained 1 percent this year
before today, compared with a 7.4 percent advance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. 
Full-Year Forecast 
IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
been up 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. 
Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. 
IBM said profit this year will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts predicted
$11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Still, the company has yet to signal that profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than steps like costs cutting and
stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint
AmTech in San Francisco. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;Really good
financial management from an earnings perspective. At the end of
the day, not much from a revenue perspective.&#8221; 
Currency Effect 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in its
higher-margin software and services units, which now make up
more than 80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost
gross profit margins, the percentage of sales left after
production costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year
basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. U.S. government plans to put patient health records
online may spur more than $20 billion in spending, Framingham,
Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.

Morgan Stanley climbed the most in
three months on the New York Stock Exchange after posting
earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates on higher fixed-income
trading revenue. 
The shares rose 4 percent after the New York-based bank
said first-quarter net income was $1.78 billion, or 99 cents a
share. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.03 a share,
including a 21-cent tax benefit, compared with the 57-cent
average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income results, the best since the
third quarter of 2008, follow record revenue from debt trading
reported earlier this month by Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer
James Gorman, who succeeded John Mack in January, said in a
letter to shareholders last week he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the
company&#8217;s performance in 2009 and the firm had hired 350
employees as part of a &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of sales and trading. 
&#8220;This was really surprising,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of hedge
fund Second Curve Capital LLC in New York, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Given the previous four quarters, where
they really looked like the weak sister, this quarter they
really stepped out. These were great numbers.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley climbed $1.23 to $31.68 at 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching
$32.29 earlier today. The shares have gained 7 percent this
year, compared with a 5.9 percent drop for Goldman Sachs and a
16 percent increase in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index. 
SEC&#8217;s Case 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares fell 5.6 percent on April 16, as
the SEC accused Goldman Sachs of failing to tell investors in a
2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, played a part in
selecting the underlying assets. Goldman Sachs has said the
SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that
it plans to &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the case. 
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a
conference call with analysts today that the firm has not
received a Wells notice, a signal of the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s intention to pursue a lawsuit, regarding its
collateralized debt obligations business. 
Revenue from fixed-income sales and trading jumped to $2.7
billion in the quarter from $1.29 billion a year earlier. That
beat estimates for $1.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit
Suisse Group AG and $2.04 billion from Keith Horowitz at
Citigroup Inc. 
&#8216;Coming Back&#8217; 
&#8220;The fixed-income franchise is coming back for Morgan
Stanley,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel
Investment LLC, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;The
history of this organization is that it&#8217;s very strong on the
fixed-income side.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs reported fixed-income revenue of $7.39
billion yesterday. Bank of America and JPMorgan, the two biggest
U.S. banks by assets, both beat analysts&#8217; earnings estimates
last week as they posted fixed-income revenue of $5.52 billion
and $5.46 billion, respectively. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s profit compared with a loss of $177
million, or 57 cents, in the first quarter of 2009, the bank
said today in a statement. Revenue more than tripled to $9.08
billion. 
Morgan Stanley generated $887 million in revenue from
investment banking, up from $811 million a year earlier. In
equities trading, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s $1.42 billion of first-
quarter revenue was up from $954 million a year earlier. The
unit&#8217;s revenue compares with $2.35 billion at Goldman Sachs and
$1.5 billion at JPMorgan. 
Smith Barney 
Global wealth management posted pretax income of $278
million, compared with $119 million in the first quarter of
2009, as the unit benefited from its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. Asset management reported a
pretax profit of $173 million, compared with a pretax loss of
$283 million in the previous year&#8217;s first quarter. 
Morgan Stanley recorded a $932 million loss on its $1.2
billion investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC, the
developer of an unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Porat said the company plans to dispose of the
investment in the next 12 months. 
The Revel loss was partly offset by a $775 million payment
Morgan Stanley received from Discover Financial Services to
resolve a legal dispute. Both were included in discontinued
operations. 
Wealth Management 
The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage&#8217;s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. 
&#8220;That progression is what we&#8217;re looking at as an
indication that the integration is continuing on track,&#8221; Porat
said in an interview. &#8220;The revenues are pretty flat from the
fourth quarter, and that reflects a more muted retail
environment. Retail investors just weren&#8217;t as active.&#8221; 
Net new client assets in the unit were $5.8 billion, the
highest since the third quarter of 2008. The unit had 18,140
advisers as of March 31 as turnover was at &#8220;historic lows,&#8221;
Porat said. 
Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.4 billion in the
quarter, or 49 percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost
compared with $2.08 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when
the firm set aside 68 percent of revenue. 
The compensation ratio was 41 percent in the institutional
securities business, which includes the trading and investment
banking units, and 64 percent in the wealth-management division.
Porat said the firm aims to reduce the ratio in the brokerage as
revenue increases.

Asia weathered the &#8220;Lehman shock&#8221;
of 2008 with impressive calm. Now it is being tested by a jolt
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Markets recoiled at the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud suit against Goldman. On April 19,
stocks fell the most in two months on concern that financial
companies face greater scrutiny. By the following day, all was
forgotten in Asia. 
Perhaps it dawned on traders that the SEC action is good
for the region. Its resilience amid the global crisis and
progress in decoupling from the West haven&#8217;t changed. Looking
forward, anything that brings real reform to the biggest economy
is stellar news for Asia and the rest of the world. 
When you consider the tests of the last 19 months, such as
a global credit crunch, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
bankruptcy and Greece&#8217;s deficit woes, the odds of Asia escaping
any fallout looked grim. Especially with Japan beset by
deflation and China reliant on U.S. consumers living beyond
their means. Asia has managed to confound the skeptics, and that
isn&#8217;t about to change. 
Even the big challenge of central banks falling behind the
inflation curve is an enviable one. In Washington and Frankfurt,
the focus is on monetary policy&#8217;s limits. Near-zero interest
rates aren&#8217;t boosting growth as fast as they were supposed to.
The troubles facing officials in Hanoi and Seoul are preferable. 
Bank Stocks 
It&#8217;s worth noting that bank shares in countries such as
China and India have outperformed global rivals by about 30
percentage points since Lehman blew up in September 2008. That
dynamic should continue and even gain steam. 
A couple of years ago, many global investors considered
Asia&#8217;s regulatory environment too strict and inhibiting of
financial innovation. Nowadays, that conservatism is a virtue.
The health of Asian balance sheets and the reasonable pace of
loan growth relative to the U.S. and Europe explain why
investors are heading this way. 
Asia is hardly devoid of problems. It has done well on a
macroeconomic level during this crisis, yet it&#8217;s also been hit
hard below the surface. 
&#8220;We have 70 million-plus people still mired in poverty as
a result of the financial crisis,&#8221; Rajat Nag, managing director
of the Asian Development Bank, said on April 19. Nag, for one,
is &#8220;very pleased&#8221; with the SEC&#8217;s move to go after Goldman. 
Tightrope Walking 
Central banks have quite a bit of tightrope walking to do.
They need to be mindful of struggling households. They also must
mop up liquidity to avoid excessive asset prices. Indonesia is a
case in point: Even the central bank agrees Jakarta&#8217;s stock
market is a bubble. 
Japan&#8217;s woes are growing, too. Asia&#8217;s biggest economy was
hit hard by the financial crisis. Yet Japan&#8217;s experience jibes
with the nature of the turmoil. This crisis didn&#8217;t go to the
periphery of the global economy, but to its core. It&#8217;s the Group
of Seven economies that are reeling, not developing ones. 
The Lehman shock gave way to the &#8220;Toyota shock,&#8221; which
really was a two-part process. The first was the plunge in
Toyota Motor Corp. sales in late 2008 and into 2009. The second
was the celebrated brand&#8217;s car-safety debacle. 
If there is a silver lining here, it&#8217;s that Asia is proving
adept at living without Japan. Strong growth from China and
India don&#8217;t fill the void left by a hobbled U.S., yet it&#8217;s
helping. And so, the Asia decoupling argument gets to live on
until challenged anew by the next global crisis. 
U.S. Reform 
On that front, Goldman&#8217;s plight is actually good news.
Surprise on the part of Asian investors at the lack of financial
reform in Washington gave way to disillusionment. Signs that
U.S. regulators are finally trying to exact some justice from
Wall Street could change everything. 
That the effort involves Goldman Sachs means it&#8217;s a bit
loaded. Schadenfreude abounded last year when a Rolling Stone
magazine writer labeled Goldman a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity.&#8221; It&#8217;s an image that captured how
many in Asia viewed Wall Street following the region&#8217;s 1997
crisis. American funds came in, wrapped their tentacles around
assets and bought them on the cheap. 
A functioning U.S. financial industry is one thing; a
sustainable one is equally important. American has been sending
financial contagion Asia&#8217;s way for the past 18 months, just as
Asia sent it to the West a decade earlier. The key for the
global economy is to avoid a repeat of either scenario. 
Until now, there has been scant evidence that the U.S. was
righting its anything-goes model. The SEC&#8217;s Goldman suit is just
the tip of the iceberg. As such actions spread and financial
executives are made accountable, Asia can look forward to the
day when U.S. markets are sounder destinations for their
trillions of dollars of savings. 
Asia is working to wean itself off the U.S. In the
meantime, what&#8217;s good for the world&#8217;s dominant financial power
is good for Asia. Unlike the Lehman one, the Goldman shock may
be just the thing for this region&#8217;s prosperity.

 Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, booked a $932 million loss on its
investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC, the developer of an
unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
The loss on the $1.2 billion investment was included in the
New York-based firm&#8217;s first-quarter results today, according to
a statement. Morgan Stanley said this month it will sell the
stalled casino on 20 acres of beachfront property along Atlantic
City&#8217;s boardwalk. 
Morgan Stanley bought the land for $74 million in 2006.
Planned as the biggest casino resort in Atlantic City, Revel
needs more than $1 billion to complete the project. Morgan
Stanley, which owns 95 percent of the development, contributed
the land to developer Kevin DeSanctis and funded construction. 
&#8220;The intent was to build it out and eventually sell it,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview today. &#8220;With the ongoing weakness in Atlantic City,
our judgment was that we do not want to put more money into it.
We would be better off selling it to a more natural owner.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley rose $1.30, or 4.3 percent, to $31.75 at
11:23 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had gained 2.9 percent this year before today. 
Since 2008, the firm has been winding down Morgan Stanley
Principal Investments, the unit that invested in Revel and other
companies and projects for the bank&#8217;s own account, Mark Lake, a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, said today in an interview. 
Loan Negotiations 
Revel has been negotiating with the Export-Import Bank of
China for a loan to finish construction, New Jersey gaming
enforcement documents show. Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack
&#8220;recently spoke&#8221; to China Ex-Im&#8217;s chairman about loan terms,
according to documents dated Feb. 17 and submitted to the
state&#8217;s casino commission by the Division of Gaming Enforcement. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Lake declined to comment on the documents. 
&#8220;Revel remains fully engaged in discussions with potential
lenders on securing the remaining capital required to complete
the interior fit-out of the property and the completion of the
construction phase of the project,&#8221; Joe Jaffoni, an outside
spokesman for Revel, said today in an e-mail. &#8220;Once final
financing is secured, we estimate it will take 20 months to
complete and open the facility.&#8221; 
Atlantic City gambling revenue tumbled a record 13 percent
last year, the third straight annual decline, after nearby
states allowed slot machines. Six of the 11 New Jersey casinos
wound up in bankruptcy or restructuring, and development has
stalled. New Jersey&#8217;s budget last month projected the casinos
may generate 12 percent less in tax revenue in the coming fiscal
year.

Morgan Stanley, which reported
earnings today that beat analyst&#8217;s estimates, said the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 17 percent in the
first quarter. 
Value-at-risk in commodity prices, a measure of how much
the firm estimates it might lose in a single day, rose to $27
million in the three months ended March 31 from $23 million in
the preceding quarter, the company said. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history, said yesterday that the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 29 percent in the
first quarter. 
Value-at-risk rose to $49 million in the three months ended
March 31 from $38 million in the preceding quarter, the company

The nation&#8217;s largest banks are
pumping more money into the battle over the rewriting of the
rules of finance as legislation heads to a vote in the Senate as
early as this week. 
Six of the top 10 U.S. banks by assets, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley,
ramped up donations to lawmakers from their political action
committees in the last month, according to reports filed for
yesterday&#8217;s Federal Election Commission deadline. 
Goldman, Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp were among
seven banks that increased the amount spent on lobbying during
the first three months of the year compared with the same period
in 2009, separate reports filed with Congress showed. The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce doubled its lobbying spending in the first
quarter. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re in the endgame,&#8221; said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer
program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
which is pressing for stronger regulations. &#8220;They&#8217;re all-in to
defeat reform.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.,
all based in New York, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. each donated
more to federal candidates in March than in the previous two
months combined.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
signaled it will fight a U.S. lawsuit over subprime mortgage
instruments the same way Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch
unit and UBS AG have challenged similar claims -- by invoking
the concept of caveat emptor: Latin for buyer beware. 
The strategy may work. By insisting that purchasers of
collateralized debt obligations knew what they were getting
into, Goldman Sachs is following a well-traveled path. Both
Merrill and UBS won dismissal of similar claims that they
misrepresented the risks of such assets by saying the buyers
were sophisticated enough to know better. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of creating and selling the CDOs without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the instrument. Goldman Sachs denied any
wrongdoing, saying that it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to
customers about the risks. 
Goldman Sachs, whose mantra is clients&#8217; interests always
come first, has said &#8220;these are sophisticated investors who
knew what they were buying,&#8221; said David Irwin, a former federal
prosecutor in private practice in Towson, Maryland. The bank is
arguing that the average buyer of this product isn&#8217;t some
&#8220;credit union that didn&#8217;t know what it was doing,&#8221; he said. 
In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market began to falter,
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO vehicle, known as Abacus,
linking it to bundles of subprime mortgages whose value would
rise or fall depending on whether homeowners paid them off. 
The SEC alleged in its April 16 complaint that, had Goldman
Sachs customers known Paulson helped choose the securities that
formed the basis of the CDO, and that Paulson was betting
against them, they might not have bought any. The regulator&#8217;s
case in Manhattan federal court may hinge on that issue, said
lawyer Mark Zauderer of New York&#8217;s Flemming Zulack Williamson
Zauderer LLC, who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. 
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
CDOs and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
Goldman Sachs also said yesterday that the U.S. case hinges
on the actions of an employee it placed on paid leave this week. 
 Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about the
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will be de-registered from
the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm in London said yesterday. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; 
By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publicly distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. 
Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP in
New York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. The New York-
based bank has denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the
SEC&#8217;s case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and
fact.&#8221; 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).

Legal Reviews 
BHP Says It Found Evidence of Possible Corruption 
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
found evidence of possible breaches of anti-corruption laws
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information for an investigation. 
BHP identified &#8220;possible violations of applicable anti-
corruption laws involving interactions with government
officials,&#8221; Melbourne-based BHP said today in a statement. The
U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office said BHP &#8220;opened a dialogue&#8221; and
is cooperating. 
The company said the probe into the termination of some
minerals exploration projects didn&#8217;t involve its business in China, where four Rio Tinto Group executives were jailed last
month for bribery. U.S. regulators have increased scrutiny of
corporate governance and compliance following the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
The SEC couldn&#8217;t &#8220;confirm or deny the existence or non-
existence of any investigation,&#8221; John Nester, a Washington-
based spokesman, said in an e-mail. 
BHP &#8220;has been in to see us,&#8221; David Jones, a spokesman for
the U.K.&#8217;s SFO, said in an e-mail. The Australian Securities and
Investments Commission couldn&#8217;t comment, spokeswoman Georgie
Morell said. 
BHP has exploration projects in Chile, Zambia, Australia,
Gabon, South America, Russia, West Africa and Canada, the
company said today in its quarterly exploration report, in which
it revealed the probe.

Goldman Faces Formal U.K. Probe After SEC Fraud Suit 
The London units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, will be formally
investigated by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator after U.S.
authorities sued the bank for fraud. 
The Financial Services Authority said in a statement
yesterday that it will begin a formal probe after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. The FSA
said yesterday it was reviewing whether a full investigation
into the New York-based bank was warranted. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the agency, which he
created in 1997, to investigate Goldman Sachs, accusing
employees of the bank of &#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; The bank may be
fined or individuals banned if the FSA finds a breach of its
rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president named in the SEC case,
Fabrice Tourre, works at the bank&#8217;s London office. 
&#8220;The U.K. entity, Goldman Sachs International, is not
mentioned in the SEC complaint, but the FSA&#8217;s latest move means
that this part of Goldman Sachs is now under the spotlight
too,&#8221; said Clive Cunningham, a regulatory lawyer at Taylor
Wessing LLP who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &#8220;The question is
whether Goldman Sachs International was involved and, if so, did
it breach any U.K. regulatory rules.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs will cooperate with the FSA&#8217;s investigation,
the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank has
previously denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s
case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
Tourre, 31, has been placed on paid leave until an
unspecified date, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said yesterday.
Pamela Chepiga, Tourre&#8217;s lawyer at Allen  Overy LLP in New
York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment.

New Suits 
Staten Island Investment Adviser Charged With Fraud 
Gryphon Holdings Inc.&#8217;s owner and four employees of the
Staten Island, New York-based investment firm were charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in an
alleged $17.5 million scheme. 
Kenneth Marsh, 43, Gryphon&#8217;s president, and the employees,
who are accused of falsely claiming endorsements from financier
George Soros, are scheduled to appear in court yesterday,
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell said in an e-mailed
statement. 
Investors, usually elderly retirees, received unsolicited
e-mails and phone calls touting Gryphon&#8217;s services, according to
the statement. Once the victims provided contact information,
Gryphon&#8217;s employees used high-pressure tactics and
misrepresentations to sell more expensive versions of their
services, Campbell said.

Banca Carige Sues Citigroup Over Note, Swap Deal 
 Banca Carige SpA sued Citigroup Inc. for misrepresenting as
safe a deal that allegedly cost the northern Italian bank almost
all of its $47 million investment. 
Citigroup put its own interests above Banca Carige&#8217;s in
January 2007 when it sold 10 million euros ($13.5 million) in a
fund-linked note to the bank&#8217;s insurance units and entered into
a 25 million euro fund-linked total return swap with Banca
Carige, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan. 
Banca Carige and the insurers &#8220;had no interest in risky or
speculative investments, and were looking only to obtain good,
consistent returns with as little risk as possible,&#8221; the Genoa-
based bank wrote in its complaint. 
Citigroup knew the investors&#8217; objectives and misrepresented
that the deal was a low-risk investment because the note and the
swap were linked to an offshore bond fund that &#8220;earned reliable
returns through an &#8216;arbitrage opportunity&#8217; with municipal
bonds,&#8221; Banca Carige said. 
&#8220;Citi believes these claims are without merit and we will
defend ourselves vigorously,&#8221; Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based company, said by e-mail. 
The case is Banca Carige SpA v. Citigroup Inc., 10-cv-3310,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Household International Sues Insurer Over Coverage 
Household International Inc., found liable last year by a
Chicago jury for misleading investors about the company&#8217;s
business practices, sued an insurance company in a bid to force
payment of its legal bills. 
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co., based in Hamilton,
Bermuda, is refusing to provide $25 million of coverage,
contending that some of the claims in the lawsuit predate Nov.
1, 2000, when the policy went into effect, Household Financial
said yesterday in documents in federal court in Chicago. 
&#8220;It is virtually certain that the entire limits of the
Princeton policy will be needed for ongoing defense costs,&#8221;
Household said in its statement of claim. &#8220;Princeton flatly
denied Household&#8217;s request for payment.&#8221; 
The jury last May 8 found the company and three executives
including Chief Executive Officer William Aldinger, misled
investors from 1994 to 2005 with reckless remarks in financial
statements, inflating the value of the shares. 
The insurance case is Household International Inc. v.
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co. 1:10-cv-02418. U.S. District
Court, and the shareholder suit is Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension
Plan v. Household International Inc., 1:02-cv-05893, U.S.

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Judge Calls New York&#8217;s Greenberg Case &#8216;Devastating&#8217; 
New York&#8217;s case against American International Group Inc.&#8217;s
former Chief Executive Officer Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg is
&#8220;devastating,&#8221; State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos said
yesterday during a court hearing. 
The judge is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2005 by
then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that accused
Greenberg, 84, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard
Smith of using sham reinsurance deals and other transactions to
distort the reported financial condition of the company. 
Assistant Attorney General David Ellenhorn yesterday told
Ramos that Greenberg directed or participated in fraudulent
transactions. David Boies, Greenberg&#8217;s lawyer, said the state
had &#8220;failed&#8221; and was relying on hearsay and inadmissible
evidence from a federal case in which Greenberg wasn&#8217;t a
defendant. 
&#8220;I can see big problems with establishing a defense&#8221; to
the state&#8217;s claims about securities fraud, Ramos told Boies.
&#8220;Mr. Ellenhorn has put together a devastating case, a strong
case, and we both know it.&#8221; 
Greenberg&#8217;s lawyers and attorneys from New York Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s office are each asking Ramos in Manhattan
to grant their motion for summary judgment, or a decision before
trial. Greenberg has also asked, in the alternative, for Ramos
to dismiss the lawsuit. The former CEO wasn&#8217;t in court
yesterday. 
Greenberg has accused Spitzer of using the case to promote
his political career, according to a filing in state Supreme
Court. 
The case is New York v. Maurice Greenberg, 401720/2005, New
York Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).

Trials/Appeals 
Rorech Testifies in First Insider-Trading Default-Swap Case 
Jon-Paul Rorech, the Deutsche Bank AG bond salesman who&#8217;s a
defendant in U.S. regulators&#8217; first insider-trading case over
credit-default swaps, took the stand in the trial. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Rorech,
39, of illegally feeding information on a 2006 bond sale by
Dutch media company VNU Group BV to Renato Negrin, 46, a former
Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager. Negrin, Rorech&#8217;s co-
defendant, bought swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit when the
deal was announced, the SEC said in a complaint in May. 
Nancy Brown, an SEC lawyer, asked Rorech yesterday if he
understood in July 2006 that Deutsche Bank had &#8220;restricted&#8221;
VNU&#8217;s securities. 
&#8220;At one point I believe we were restricted from trading
securities but I did not believe I was restricted from
soliciting,&#8221; Rorech responded. &#8220;How can you market without
discussing what the relevant securities are?&#8221; 
Rorech, who is on paid administrative leave from Deutsche
Bank, is scheduled to continue his testimony today. U.S.
District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan is hearing the
nonjury trial, which began April 7. 
The SEC didn&#8217;t accuse Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or New
York-based hedge fund Millennium of wrongdoing. 
The commission&#8217;s civil suit focuses on efforts by VNU,
later renamed Nielsen Co., to restructure its debt as part of a
7.5 billion euro ($10 billion) leveraged buyout. 
After complaints from potential investors that the $1.67
billion in bonds wouldn&#8217;t be covered by existing VNU credit-
default swaps, VNU created a tranche of bonds that would be
covered. 
The SEC said Rorech tipped Negrin about the restructuring
before that announcement. Negrin bought 20 million euros of
swaps, and profited by selling them after the deal was announced
and the swap price rose, the SEC said. 
Negrin is liable because he knew, or should have known,
Rorech had a duty to keep the information private, the SEC said. 
Rorech and Negrin argue that the SEC has no jurisdiction
over the credit-default swaps because they are private
contracts, not securities. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). 
Former IKB Chief May Call More Witnesses After Goldman Case 
Former IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Ortseifen may call more witnesses at his German
criminal trial following the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Ortseifen, 59, is on trial on charges that he failed to
warn investors about the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market before the bank was forced to seek a government bailout.
The bank lost nearly all of its $150 million investment in the
subprime-mortgage related products at the center of the SEC case
against Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;We are considering calling more and other people to
witness in the case,&#8221; Rainer Hamm, his lawyer, said in an
interview at a court in Dusseldorf, Germany, where Ortseifen is
being tried for misleading investors. Ortseifen is observing the
Goldman development &#8220;with big interest&#8221; and it is too early to
say if he will change his defense strategy, the lawyer said. 
IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has received guarantees of as much as 12
billion euros ($16.2 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue fund.
Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by downplaying
the effect of the real estate crisis in a press release on July
20, 2007. Ortseifen stepped down nine days later and shares of
IKB fell 20 percent. 
The SEC says a Goldman executive misled a collateral
manager, ACA Management LLC, and IKB about Paulson&#8217;s role. 
The German case is LG Dusseldorf, 14 KLs 6/09.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Schwab Agrees to Pay $200 Million in Fund Settlement 
 Charles Schwab Corp. said it agreed to pay $200 million to
settle claims that it misled investors on the amount of
mortgage-backed securities held by its Schwab YieldPlus Fund. 
Schwab signed a memorandum of understanding to settle the
claims filed in 2008 by paying the $200 million to plaintiffs,
without admitting liability and avoiding trial, the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a statement. The
settlement agreement cuts first-quarter net income by $105
million, or 9 cents a share, bringing the company&#8217;s net income
reported last week down to $14 million, or 1 cent per share. 
The lawsuit alleged that Schwab incorrectly described the
fund, once the world&#8217;s largest short-term bond fund, as
&#8220;safe.&#8221; The plaintiffs sought damages of as much as $802
million, the estimate of losses made by their lawyers&#8217; experts.
A trial was scheduled for May. 
Schwab had denied wrongdoing, saying the fund&#8217;s losses were
caused by the collapse of the financial markets. U.S. District
Judge William H. Alsup denied Schwab&#8217;s bid to dismiss the case
earlier this month. 
The case is In Re Charles Schwab Corp. Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-01510, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). 
Schottenfeld Settlement in Galleon SEC Case Approved 
Schottenfeld Group LLC won a judge&#8217;s approval of a $763,000
settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading investigation. 
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York approved the
agreement in an order yesterday. Schottenfeld Group agreed to
pay $460,475 in disgorgement, $72,203 in interest and a $230,238
civil penalty, according to a March 29 letter from the SEC to
Rakoff. The firm also agreed to implement policies to assure
compliance with securities laws. 
Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam is accused in both civil and
criminal cases of using secret tips from hedge fund executives,
corporate officials and other insiders to earn millions of
dollars in illegal stock trades. Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi,
a New Castle Funds LLC consultant, are among 21 people who were
charged criminally since October in two overlapping insider
trading cases. 
Zvi Goffer and David Plate, formerly of Schottenfeld Group,
have pleaded not guilty in the criminal case. Gautham Shankar, a
former trader at Schottenfeld Group, pleaded guilty and is
cooperating with prosecutors. 
Schottenfeld Group&#8217;s disgorgement represents the amount the
firm either profited or avoided losing in the Galleon case,
according to the SEC&#8217;s letter. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
SEC case is SEC v. Galleon Management LP, 09-cv-08811, U.S.

Ex-Siemens Managers Get Suspended Terms Over Bribery 
Two former managers at Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s biggest
engineering company, were found guilty of breach of trust by a
Munich court and received suspended sentences and fines. 
A former unit chief executive officer, identified only as
Joerg Michael K., 55, received a suspended sentence of two years
and was ordered to pay 160,000 euros ($215,000), the Munich
court said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The head of
accounting at the unit, Hans-Werner H., 55, received an 18-month
suspended sentence and was ordered to pay 40,000 euros. 
&#8220;Both men tolerated and supported a system of slush funds
at Siemens,&#8221; the court said. The system was &#8220;set up for the
sole purpose of paying bribes.&#8221; 
Siemens, based in Munich, has been embroiled in a bribery
scandal since 2006, leading to investigations in at least a
dozen countries, revealing it paid kickbacks and bribes to win
contracts. Siemens agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle probes
in the U.S. and Germany in 2008. Prosecution of individual
managers has been ongoing. 
Joerg Michael K., who joined Siemens in 1974, became the
head of the communications unit in 2001. He was told about the
system of slush funds and chose not to stop it. He later gave
another Siemens employee in charge of organizing the system
powers to sign sham contracts. 
Hans-Werner H., who learned about the scheme in 2003,
didn&#8217;t have his accounting staff thoroughly review the
transactions, according to the court. Between 2002 and 2004, the
system put 49 million euros in the slush funds which were used
for bribery. 
Boehringer Agrees to Settle Wisconsin Medicaid Suit 
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, the world&#8217;s largest privately
held drugmaker, agreed to pay $7.75 million to settle Wisconsin
claims that it overcharged a government health program for
medicine. 
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim
Roxane, Roxane Laboratories and Ben Venue Laboratories, all
units of Boehringer, agreed to pay the state Medicaid program $7
million and $750,000 to Miner, Barnhill  Galland PC for legal
fees, in a settlement announced yesterday by Wisconsin Attorney
General J.B. Van Hollen. 
&#8220;This settlement again demonstrates to anyone who attempts
to defraud medical assistance programs that my office will
pursue them to the fullest extent of the law,&#8221; Van Hollen said
in a statement. The state won&#8217;t &#8220;line the pockets of those who
would engage in deceptive and fraudulent pricing activities.&#8221; 
Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, complies with all
federal and state Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, Amy Kunkel,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;This case was settled to end expensive and disruptive
litigation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wisconsin acknowledged that the
settlement did not constitute an admission of fault or liability
by Boehringer.&#8221; 
The case is State of Wisconsin v. Abbott Inc., 04-cv-1709,
Dane County (Madison). 
Vodafone, O2 Win U.K. Appeal of Price Controls 
 Vodafone Group Plc, Telefonica SA&#8217;s O2 unit and other
mobile network operators overturned a U.K. ruling that applied
retroactive price controls that cut fees they charge to connect
callers from other networks. 
The Court of Appeal in London yesterday ruled that a lower
court couldn&#8217;t force the U.K.&#8217;s telecommunications regulator
Ofcom to apply a court-ordered reduction of limits on
&#8220;termination fees&#8221; back to 2007. The other operators are
France Telecom SA&#8217;s Orange unit and Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s T-Mobile. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied that the tribunal has no power to direct
Ofcom to impose revised price controls on a retrospective
basis,&#8221; said the three judge panel. The money involved in the
case amounts to &#8220;hundreds of millions of pounds,&#8221; the judges
said in the ruling. 
The ruling is a victory for Ofcom, which challenged a
finding by the Competition Appeal Tribunal that it should apply
price controls retroactively when charges are reduced further by
a court. Ofcom was ordered in 2009 to further cut price controls
it had already lowered in 2007. 
Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, and Simon Lloyd, a
spokesman for O2, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment.

Obama Considers Corporate Lawyer for Justice Department Job 
James M. Cole, a corporate defense lawyer who served as an
independent monitor of American International Group Inc., is
being vetted by the Obama administration for the No. 2 job at
the Justice Department, according to a person familiar with the
matter. 
Cole, a partner at Bryan Cave LLP in Washington and a
former Justice Department prosecutor, would replace former
Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden, who left office earlier
this year. If nominated by Obama, Cole would need to be
confirmed by the Senate. 
Cole was an official with the Justice Department for 13
years before entering private practice, according to his law
firm&#8217;s Web site. His law practice includes advising companies on
securities, regulatory and criminal law matters.

Lawyers Made $60,000 From U.K. Insider Scam, Prosecutors Say 
Two attorneys who worked at the London offices of U.S. law
firms made illegal trades in NeuTec Pharma Ltd. after the
company&#8217;s financial director leaked information about a proposed
takeover, prosecutors told a court. 
Andrew Rimmington, a former corporate partner at Dorsey 
Whitney LLP,  Michael McFall, an ex-corporate partner at
McDermott Will  Emery LLP and NeuTec&#8217;s former financial
director Peter King are on trial for insider trading in a case
brought by the Financial Services Authority. 
Prosecutor Michael Bowes said the two lawyers made a profit
of 39,000 pounds each ($60,000) in June 2006 after King gave
McFall an early warning about Basel-based Novartis AG&#8217;s plan to
purchase NeuTec. McFall then passed the information on to
Rimmington, Bowes said. The men deny wrongdoing. 
They will present their defense later in the case, which is
scheduled to last six weeks.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, won an appeals patent case in Germany
over its file allocation table technology, or FAT, that allows
older computer operating systems to run alongside new software
using long file names. 
The Federal Court of Justice granted Microsoft&#8217;s appeal
against a lower court ruling, the court said in an e-mail today.
The case concerned the validity of European Patent EP 0618 540
in Germany. After hearing the case yesterday, the country&#8217;s top
civil tribunal overturned a ruling by Germany&#8217;s Federal Patent
Court that said the patent must be voided as it didn&#8217;t contain
an invention of new technology. 
The technology can be used by devices including digital
cameras and automotive navigation systems. Microsoft, holding
equivalent U.S. patents, last year sued Dutch navigation-device
maker TomTom NV over the technology used in global-positioning
systems for cars. The companies settled. 
The patent protects technology that makes Microsoft&#8217;s MS-
DOS operating system, which can only handle files of up to eight
digits, compatible with applications that use longer names. It
allowed Microsoft to introduce its VFAT file system, making it
compatible with MS-DOS&#8217;s FAT file system. 
The Federal Patent Court had argued that the Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol, used for file storages on CD-ROMs, had
already introduced the method. 
The case is BGH, X ZR 27/07.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, told Japanese clients
the collateralized debt obligation at the center of a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit wasn&#8217;t sold in the country. 
Goldman Sachs also said its Japanese asset management unit
didn&#8217;t participate in structuring or selling the CDO, according
to a Japanese-language letter to clients, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg News. Representatives from the firm will
visit clients to provide additional explanation if requested,
the letter said. 
&#8220;We are explaining to our clients in Japan that the
synthetic CDO in question was not sold in Japan,&#8221; said Hiroko
Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. Matsumoto,
who confirmed the contents of the letter, said Japanese clients
began receiving it earlier this week. She declined to
comment on their responses. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
New York-based company misled investors in a collateralized debt
obligation, called Abacus 2007-AC1. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon
Brown has asked for Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority to
start an inquiry, as the ramifications of the suit affect the
company globally. 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO, which was
linked to subprime mortgages, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicle. The hedge fund wasn&#8217;t sued by the SEC. 
Goldman Sachs in its letter to Japanese clients said the
SEC suit is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
The bank said yesterday its net income rose 91 percent to
$3.46 billion, or $5.59 per share, in the three months through
March.

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
was sued by a former employee who said the bank fired him
without cause and breached a spinout agreement that allowed him
to leave with the private equity team and platform he managed. 
Varun Kumar Bery, former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Private Capital
Asia unit, filed the complaint on Monday against his former
employer in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance claiming damages
&#8220;in the region of US$30.8 million.&#8221; JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie
Cheung declined to comment on the matter. 
According to the complaint, Bery joined JPMorgan in January
2008 after negotiations with Gaby Abdelnour, the bank&#8217;s Asia-
Pacific chairman and chief executive officer, to establish a
private equity group within the firm. 
The complaint states that after a firm-wide reorganization
in 2009 when JPMorgan disbanded an investment-banking unit that
bet on leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and real estate, the head
of a new global special opportunities business, Chris Nicholas,
indicated the bank wouldn&#8217;t commit more capital to Bery&#8217;s group. 
Abdelnour told Bery that JPMorgan &#8220;did not intend to
permit&#8221; the spinout, or departure of the business, according to
the complaint. 
Bery, 51, alleges the bank later acknowledged through its
lawyers breaching the spinout agreement and &#8220;did not proceed
expeditiously, constructively or responsively with the
negotiations&#8221; of finalizing the spinout. 
The fund manager is seeking a court order for the bank to
carry out the agreement and to recover any losses due to the
delay. 
The case is HCCL9/2010 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First
Instance.

U.S. and European non-financial
companies may sell Kangaroo bonds for the first time in four
years to profit from historically-low currency swap costs,
according to Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty. 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. affiliate is in talks with
potential borrowers about sales of local-currency notes in
Australia, head of debt capital markets Robert Foale said in an
interview in Sydney, declining to name the companies. Vodafone
Group Plc raised A$265 million ($247 million) in August 2006 in
the last Kangaroo sale by a non-financial company, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll see new corporate names in the Kangaroo
market in the next six months, and over the next 12 months it
should build up some momentum,&#8221; Foale said. &#8220;If they can
access a new market, diversify funding and currency, and they
don&#8217;t have to pay up for it, it&#8217;s a great opportunity.&#8221; 
Scottish Power Ltd. and Vodafone were among overseas
companies that sold bonds in Australia before the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to retreat to
the relative safety of government debt, closing the Kangaroo
market to all but supranational lenders and state-backed
borrowers. JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised A$700 million from
Kangaroo notes last month after credit markets thawed.

Contributions from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. employees threaten to become toxic campaign assets
for both political parties facing elections this year. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard for Democrats to make the accusation
about Republicans because the president raised so much Goldman
Sachs money,&#8221; said John Feehery, a Republican political
strategist who advised former House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
Donations from the bank&#8217;s employees became an issue when
U.S. Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias pushed his Republican
opponent in Illinois to return such contributions after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a fraud lawsuit April
16 against Goldman Sachs. 
Giannoulias said the money sent to the campaign of his
opponent, Republican congressman Mark Kirk, is &#8220;tainted,&#8221;
without saying whether President Barack Obama should return
almost $1 million that bank employees contributed to his White
House bid. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs employees tend to have a lot of money that
they can give to politicians,&#8221; Feehery said. &#8220;They are very
good at reading the marketplace.&#8221; 
Obama and Democrats in Congress are proposing the most
sweeping financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
personal push by the president, who plans to deliver a speech on
the subject on April 22 at the Cooper Union in New York, comes
as Goldman reported its net income almost doubled in the first
quarter. 
California Cash 
Obama, 48, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Kirk, competing against Giannoulias for the seat once held
by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from Goldman employees, the
center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are Democratic Congressman
Michael McMahon of New York, Republican Senator Richard Shelby
of Alabama, and three other New York Democrats: Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand, Representative Scott Murphy and Senator Charles
Schumer. 
Gillibrand, 43, will wait to see whether Goldman loses its
case, said Matt Canter, a spokesman. 
&#8220;It is long-standing practice for the Gillibrand campaign
that if any contributor is found guilty of wrongdoing, then the
campaign immediately donates their contribution to charity,&#8221;
Canter said. 
Democratic Party officials dismissed the significance of
Goldman campaign contributions to Obama. 
&#8216;Tooth and Nail&#8217; 
&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement. 
Sevugan didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail query when asked
whether Obama plans to return money from Goldman Sachs
employees. Jen Psaki, a White House spokeswoman, deferred
questions about contributions to the DNC. 
Giannoulias, 34, the Illinois treasurer, criticized Kirk
April 19 for taking what he said totaled $21,600 from Goldman
Sachs employees for the Senate campaign. 
Kirk, a five-term congressman from Chicago&#8217;s northern
suburbs, said he wanted to &#8220;err on the side of caution&#8221; as the
SEC case unfolded. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas van Praag, declined to
comment yesterday on the question of contributions to Obama and
other politicians. 
Still Counting 
Kirk, 50, said that his campaign is still determining how
much Goldman Sachs employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. 
Goldman Sachs and its employees and family members gave
$5.9 million to candidates in the 2007-2008 election cycle, data
from the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics shows.
Three-quarters of that went to Democrats, the non-partisan group
said. 
Giannoulias&#8217;s campaign further criticized Kirk yesterday
for agreeing to return contributions to his Senate campaign and
not the full $54,010 it says Kirk has taken from Goldman
employees during his congressional career. 
&#8220;His artfully worded pledge to return contributions made
only in the current cycle offers a fig leaf of ethical
propriety, but in reality is nothing more than a typical
Washington politician&#8217;s trick,&#8221; Giannoulias spokesman Matt
McGrath said in a statement. 
Fraud Allegations 
The SEC filed a civil suit alleging Goldman failed to tell
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, helped
select the underlying assets. 
The bank has denied the SEC&#8217;s accusations and Greg Palm,
co-general counsel, told analysts on a conference call yesterday
that the firm didn&#8217;t intentionally mislead anyone. 
For Obama, Wall Street provided three of his seven biggest
sources of contributors for the 2008 presidential campaign. In
2007 and 2008, Goldman Sachs employees and family members gave
him $994,795, Citigroup Inc. $701,290, and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
$695,132. 
Kathleen Strand, a Giannoulias spokeswoman, declined to
provide a yes or no response when asked whether Obama should
give money back to Goldman employees. 
&#8220;Unlike President Obama, Republican Congressman Mark Kirk
takes Wall Street money hand over fist and then votes their way
every single time, including voting against Wall Street
reform,&#8221; she said in a statement. 
Kirk&#8217;s Money Lead 
Kirk raised $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2010
and ended the period with more than $3 million in the bank, his
campaign said April 7. 
Giannoulias raised $1.2 million during the first quarter
and ended the period with that amount in the bank, his campaign
said last week. 
The Senate seat in Illinois is held by Democrat Roland
Burris, who isn&#8217;t seeking a full term. Republicans are trying to
take advantage of ethical problems experienced by Illinois
Democrats, including a public corruption trial set to begin June
3 for former Governor Rod Blagojevich, who appointed Burris to
complete Obama&#8217;s term.

Apple Gets Patent for Digital Camera Color-Correction Technology 
Apple Inc., maker of the iPhone, iPod and iPad, received a
U.S. patent that may point the way to an iCamera for the
Cupertino, California-based company. 
Yesterday Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
tantalized investors with the promise of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; new
products. And April 15 Apple filed a patent-infringement
complaint with the International Trade Commission to block
imports of some Eastman Kodak Co. digital cameras 
Patent 7,701,489, which was issued to Apple April 20, is
for a method and apparatus for color correction in image-sensing
devices. The technology covered by the patent involved the use
of diffusers to determine the properties of the lighting
environment. 
This is in contrast to many digital cameras&#8217; dependence on
software&#8217;s predetermined assumptions about lighting, according
to the patent. 
Apple applied for this patent in May 2003, with the
assistance of Blakely, Sokoloff, Taylor  Zafman LLP of Los
Angeles. 
Yamaha Sued for Infringing Patents on Web Site Paper Models 
Yamaha Motor Co., the motorcycle maker second in size only
to Honda Motor Co., was sued for patent infringement by a
Chicago-based patent owner. 
Paper Models LLC accused Yamaha of infringing its patents
7,072,949 and 7,546,356, which were issued in July 2006 and June
2009 respectively. 
The two patents cover systems for providing paper model
replicas over a computer network. Yamaha&#8217;s &#8220;papercraft&#8221;
offerings on its Web site infringe these patents, Paper Models
claimed in a suit filed yesterday in federal court in Chicago. 
When accessed yesterday, the Yamaha Web site entertainment
section featured pattern sheets and instructions for making
paper models of motorcycles, animals and various Japanese
cultural artifacts such as festival shrines, doll displays and
Samurai helmets. 
Paper Models asked the court for an order barring Honda&#8217;s
future infringement of the two patents, and for money damages,
attorney fees and the costs of litigation, and requested that
any damage award be tripled. 
The patent holder is represented by Mark D. Roth of
Chicago&#8217;s Orum  Roth LLC. 
The case is Paper Models LLC v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 1:10-
cv-02459, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois

Bionovo Gets Patent for Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment  &#8216; 
Bionovo Inc. received a patent on a method of using a
Chinese medicinal herb for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer, the Emeryville, California-based company said in a
statement. 
Patent 7,700,136 covers the use of an extract of
Scutellaria barbata to arrest cancer cell growth and shrink
solid cancers. In addition to breast cancer, the patent also
covers the use of the extract to treat ovarian cancer. Bezielle
is Bionovo&#8217;s proprietary formulation of the extract. 
The extract is formed from the above-ground portions of the
plant in either a water or alcohol-based solution, according to
the patent. The plant is a member of the mint family. 
The patent was issued April 20. Bionovo applied for the
patent in November 2008, with the assistance of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich  Rosati of Palo Alto, California. 
According to the company statement, Bionovo has had two
positive Phase 1 clinical trials of Bezielle.

ACTA Text Released, Provides Damages Provisions, ISP Liability 
The parties to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
released a draft text of the accord yesterday, together with a
statement from the European Commission&#8217;s Directorate-General for
Trade that said &#8220;concerns&#8221; about the agreement &#8220;are
unfounded.&#8221; 
The U.S. is a party to the agreement, as are Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New
Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. 
Among the elements in the agreement is the question of
damages for infringement. According to the draft text, judicial
authorities should consider &#8220;any legitimate measure of value&#8221;
including lost profits, value of the infringed good or service
measured by market price, the suggested retail price or the
profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement. 
One section of the agreement appears to offer the
possibility of preventative action. Judicial authorities will
have the authority to issue an order intended to prevent &#8220;the
imminent infringement&#8221; of an IP right. 
This includes the provisions that customs authorities can,
on their own authority, act to &#8220;suspend the release&#8221; of goods
suspected of infringement. 
The agreement places the burden on Internet service
providers to &#8220;remove or disable access to infringing material
or infringing activity upon obtaining actual knowledge of the

Toyota Sued for Infringement by Owner of &#8216;Prove It!&#8217; Trademark 
Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s Toyota USA unit was sued for trademark
infringement by an Arizona resident who registered the phrase
&#8220;prove it!&#8221; as a U.S. trademark in 1998. 
Michael D. Calmese of Phoenix accused Toyota of breaching a
license agreement to use the phrase that ended Dec. 31, 2009.
Toyota used the phrase in its promotions after that date without
authorization, according to the complaint filed April 19 in
federal court in Phoenix. 
He claims that he is damaged by the automaker&#8217;s
unauthorized use of his mark, in light of &#8220;the negative image&#8221;
the Japanese automaker has as a result of its recent recalls of
defective autos. By Toyota&#8217;s &#8220;not coming clean about its
acceleration and brake problems,&#8221; Calmese has potentially been
damaged by the association&#8221; with the company, he said in his
pleadings. 
Calmese claims he&#8217;s won trademark disputes with other
companies, and asked the court to award him money damages, and
extra damaged intended to punish the automaker for its alleged
infringement. He also seeks an award of attorney fees,
litigation costs and an order barring future infringement of his
mark. 
He is unrepresented by counsel. 
The case is Calmese V. Toyota USA Inc., 2:10-cv-00857-JWS,
U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix) 
Singapore Raid Nets Counterfeit Electronics Worth $2.7 Million 
Four Singapore residents were arrested yesterday and
accused of being part of a syndicate that imported and sold
counterfeit electronics, the ChannelNewsAsia.com Web site
reported. 
Officers in the intellectual property rights branch of
Singapore&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Department seized more than
15,000 fake electronic items, mainly mobile phones, with an
estimated value of $3.7 million Singapore dollars ($2.7
million), according to the news Web site. 
The mobile phones were copies of well-known brands, and
were shipped from overseas, ChannelNewsAsia.com reported. 
This was the largest seizure of fake electronic goods in
three years, according to the news Web site. 
Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Livermore Lab Didn&#8217;t Take Nanotech Trade Secret, Jury Finds 
Lawrence Livermore National Security, operator of the U.S.
Energy Department&#8217;s Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, didn&#8217;t steal
trade secrets from a Bay Area inventor, a jury in California&#8217;s
Alameda County Superior Court said April 6. 
The jury rejected claims by Victor B. Kley and Berkeley,
California-based General Nanotechnology LLC that the lab stole a
nanotechnology process for the invention of a diamond capsule. 
The jury found that the lab officials and scientists were
researching design of nanodiamond capsules years before they
were aware of Kley&#8217;s design, the lab&#8217;s lawyers said in a
statement. The capsules are used in fusion experiments. 
Kley sued the lab management in California state court in
April 2008, alleging his technology was misappropriated and a
non-disclosure agreement was violated. He is a named inventor on
65 issued patents, according to the database of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office. 
The Livermore, California-based law was represented by
Patrick Michael, Dean Morehous and Nicole Norris of Chicago&#8217;s
Winston  Strawn LLP. 
The case is General Nanotechnology LLC v. Lawrence
Livermore National Security LLC, VG08384523, California Superior
Court, Alameda County.

Jersey-based financial adviser group said in a statement. 
Dansky joins from the Brattle Group where he was a
principle, with IP valuation and damages his area of expertise.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, reported third-quarter revenue that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions, a sign that
corporate customers may be putting off computer buying. 
Sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, compared with
analysts&#8217; estimates that were as high as $14.8 billion for the
quarter that ended March 31. Shares fell in late trading. 
While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding purchases of new machines and long-term
contracts. Investors held out for added evidence of a spending
resurgence after chipmaker Intel Corp. last week forecast rising
sales this quarter and record profit margins for 2010. 
&#8220;Expectations were for more, given the strength we&#8217;ve seen
in PC sales,&#8221; Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest
Securities, said in an interview from Portland, Oregon. He rates
the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and said he doesn&#8217;t own them. 
Microsoft fell $1.02, or 3.3 percent, to $30.37 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock
fell 3.9 percent last quarter, while the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500
Index rose 4.9 percent. 
Third-quarter net income rose 35 percent to $4.01 billion,
or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast of 42 cents in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded the $14.4 billion
average in the survey, reflecting rising demand for Windows 7,
the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship operating system. 
Putting Off Orders 
Still, some companies are reluctant to place orders that
stretch over years. Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was
$12.8 billion, according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. In January, Microsoft reported second-quarter
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates by 15 cents. 
&#8220;The deferred revenue was lower than expected, suggesting
that enterprise spending is still just beginning to recover,&#8221;
said Sarah Friar, a San Francisco-based analyst for Goldman
Sachs Group who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Microsoft. &#8220;Enterprise
spending is still making its way out of the downturn.&#8221; 
Microsoft said operating expenses for the year ending June
30 will be $26.1 billion to $26.3 billion, compared with a
January prediction of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. Microsoft
no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. 
Mixed Bag 
&#8220;Consumer demand is still strong, but we also saw for the
first time growth in business hardware spending,&#8221; said Peter
Klein, Microsoft&#8217;s chief financial officer, in an interview.
Yet, it&#8217;s still taking longer to close multiyear deals. The
company did have growth in billings for multiyear agreements, he
said. &#8220;We are starting to fill that pipeline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think it will resolve itself over time.&#8221; 
In the third quarter a year ago, net income was $2.98
billion, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $13.6 billion. 
Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. Intel, the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, last week indicated that recovery may be gathering
steam with a forecast for rising sales this quarter. 
&#8220;People had thought there would be closer correlation
between what Intel said about PC demand and PC outlook&#8221; and
Microsoft&#8217;s results, said Sasa Zorovic, a Boston-based
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem to
be the case.&#8221; He rates the shares &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Office 
Still, International Business Machines Corp. reported a
drop in services signings, showing corporate spending on larger
technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Microsoft Business Division revenue, mostly from Office
productivity software, fell 5.9 percent to $4.24 billion as some
customers held off purchases before Microsoft begins rolling out
a new version next month. Server software sales were $3.58
billion, missing estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS AG. 
While sales of server computers have started to recover, it
will take longer for sales of Microsoft&#8217;s related software to
come back, Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. 
Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. Personal-computer shipments rose
27 percent last quarter, according to Gartner Inc. The PC market
bounced back from the year-earlier period, when the recession
dragged down shipments almost 7 percent -- the worst performance
since 2001, according to market research firm IDC. 
Business, Bing 
Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division was reduced as the
company deferred some sales to a future quarter. The company
gave customers who have purchased older versions of Office the
right to upgrade to the new version, Office 2010, which is
available to businesses next month. It hits stores in June. 
Online advertising revenue rose 19 percent as search and
graphical display ad markets recovered, Klein said.&#160;Sales in the
company&#8217;s online business rose 11.6 percent to $566 million. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine has increased the company&#8217;s
share of searches by 3.7 percentage points since Microsoft
overhauled the product in June, according to research firm
ComScore Inc. Microsoft had 11.7 percent of the U.S. search
market in March, compared with 65.1 percent for Google Inc. and
16.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., according to ComScore.

While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer purchases of personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding spending on new machines and contracts
with the Redmond, Washington-based software maker. Customers may
also be refraining from deals that stretch over multiple years. 
&#8220;Investors have been looking for reasons to sell stocks,
even when the results are good,&#8221; Todd Lowenstein,
a fund manager for Highmark Capital Management, said in an
interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;They needed to deliver
near-perfect execution.&#8221; 
Microsoft fell $1.40, or 4.5 percent, to $29.99 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock

no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. 
Last Quarter&#8217;s Performance 
A year earlier, net income was $2.98 billion, or 33 cents a
share, on sales of $13.6 billion. Net income in that period
included severance costs and impairments to investments. 
In the second quarter, Microsoft beat analysts&#8217; estimates
for profit by 15 cents a year. Yet the company raised investors&#8217;
concerns by saying that gains were fueled by consumer demand as
business demand remained sluggish. Shares fell the day after the
report. 
Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, last week
indicated that recovery may be gathering steam with a forecast
for rising sales this quarter. 
Intel&#8217;s View 
Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini told analysts
corporate executives are starting to replace aging machines.
Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. 
Still, International Business Machines Corp. shares dropped
yesterday after the company reported a drop in services
signings, showing corporate spending on larger technology
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;It will be a gradual business cycle -- it&#8217;s not something
that happens in a single quarter,&#8221; Parakh said. &#8220;It will be
something that that goes on for a year or two, but it&#8217;s
important because Microsoft gets significant uplift from the
business versions of Windows.&#8221; 
PC Shipments 
Personal-computer shipments rose 27 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. That topped Gartner&#8217;s prediction of a
22 percent rise. The PC market bounced back from the year-
earlier period, when the recession dragged down shipments almost
7 percent -- the worst performance since 2001, according to
market research firm IDC.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and five past and present
executives will testify with Fabrice Tourre, the banker at the
center of U.S. fraud allegations, at a Senate hearing next week. 
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Chief Risk Officer
Craig Broderick, former mortgage department head Daniel Sparks,
and current and former structured products group managing
directors Michael Swenson and Joshua Birnbaum were listed as
witnesses for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
hearing on April 27. The hearing will explore the role of
investment banks in the financial crisis, the panel said today
in an e-mail release. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
and Tourre, 31, last week, claiming they misled investors in a
collateralized debt obligation. Tourre and Blankfein agreed to
speak publicly to show Goldman Sachs has nothing to hide, people
with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Tourre plans to
tell the panel he did nothing wrong, one person said. 
Regulators claim that Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
firm in Wall Street history, misled investors by failing to
disclose that Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire
John Paulson, helped select loans for the CDO and then bet
against them. Goldman Sachs, which is contesting the SEC&#8217;s
claims, has said it &#8220;will take all necessary steps to defend
the firm.&#8221;

General Electric Co., the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, plans to introduce a 4
megawatt gearless wind turbine for offshore use in 2012 in a
challenge to market leader Siemens AG of Germany. 
Government incentives and pricing pressure for onshore
models amid the economic slowdown make the offshore market more
attractive, Mete Maltepe, global sales leader for wind energy at
GE, said in a telephone interview on April 20. 
Customer feedback on the offshore turbine has so far been
positive, Maltepe said. GE is using technology acquired in its
August takeover of the ScanWind unit of Morphic Technologies AB
in Sweden to take on Siemens and Vestas Wind Systems A/S of
Denmark. The purchase marked a change in tack for the U.S.
company, which has mostly focused on the onshore market. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good turbine, the direct drive is key,&#8221; Maltepe
said. In the onshore segment, &#8220;there are notable headwinds in
pricing. We are reducing costs and improving the performance.
There is pressure on margins and we&#8217;ll have to see if we can
hold them up.&#8221; 
GE, with a 12.4 percent share of the overall on- and
offshore wind turbine market by capacity, is head to head with
Vestas, which in 2009 held the top spot at 12.5 percent,
according to Danish consultants BTM Consult APS. 
Cheaper to Run 
Munich-based Siemens, with 5.9 percent of the overall
market and the top spot in offshore models, is installing as
many as 10 of its new gearless 3 megawatt turbines for both
offshore and onshore use this year, with large-scale production
planned to start in 2011. Vestas CEO Ditlev Engel on Feb. 10
declined to say if his company also plans to develop a gearless
turbine. 
Direct drive or gearless turbines reduce the number of
moving parts in a unit and increase reliability, helping
minimize costly open-sea maintenance. Such technology accounted
for about 14 percent of installed capacity last year, BTM said.
Offshore wind park operators include Germany&#8217;s Enercon GmbH and
Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co. of China. 
GE has an installed base of 13,500 wind turbines, and its
wind energy business posted sales of more than $6 billion in
2009. 
&#8220;We are getting into offshore to be among the leading
suppliers,&#8221; Malpete said, declining to provide a specific time
frame.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director
Rajat Gupta is suspected by U.S. investigators of tipping off a
hedge fund billionaire to a $5 billion investment in the bank by
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a person with direct
knowledge of the inquiry said. 
Gupta, 61, who has said he won&#8217;t stand for re-election to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board, told Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam
about Buffett&#8217;s plan before it was announced in September 2008,
the person said, declining to be identified because the inquiry
isn&#8217;t public. 
Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is fighting criminal
charges and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil claims
that he used inside information to trade shares of companies
including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In a March 22 letter to
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers, made public April 9, prosecutors said they
had an interest in his trading in Goldman Sachs stock in 2008.
Three days before the letter was sent, Goldman Sachs announced
Gupta was leaving its board. 
&#8220;Rajat has neither violated any law nor done anything else
improper,&#8221; his attorney, Gary Naftalis of Kramer, Levin,
Naftalis  Frankel LLP, said in a statement. &#8220;He has always
conducted himself with integrity in his business, philanthropic
and personal life.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson, SEC spokesman John
Nester and Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, declined to comment. 
Gupta hasn&#8217;t been formally accused of any wrongdoing. The
Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier today. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, agreed to sell $5 billion in preferred shares that paid
10 percent interest to Buffett, after the Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. bankruptcy and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s purchase of
Merrill Lynch  Co. 
Gupta was McKinsey&#8217;s worldwide chief from 1994 to 2003, and
a senior worldwide partner until 2007. He withdrew from the
consulting firm and joined the boards of American Airlines
parent AMR Corp., Procter  Gamble Co., Harman International
Industries Inc. Genpact Ltd., the business outsourcing company,
and Russia&#8217;s OAO Sberbank.

Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., sliced another $1
million off the asking price of his Chicago mansion. 
Going into its fourth year on the market, the Gold Coast
neighborhood property is now listed for $9.5 million, according
to the Web site of broker Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty.
It was previously listed for $10.5 million by Koenig  Strey
GMAC Real Estate. 
Dimon bought the house at 25 E. Banks St. in 2000 when he
headed Chicago-based Bank One Corp. The 15,000 square-foot
mansion has eight bedrooms, nine full bathrooms and was built in
the late 1800s. Dimon first listed it for sale in April 2007 for
$13.5 million. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a statement home,&#8221; said Jim Kinney, vice president
of luxury sales for Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in
Chicago. &#8220;It represents an attractive value in the
neighborhood.&#8221; 
The house, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has a
rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. 
Sluggish Market 
The problem is that demand for Chicago&#8217;s high-end homes is
&#8220;sluggish, sluggish, sluggish,&#8221; Kinney said, even though
overall sales in the nation&#8217;s third-largest city climbed 50
percent to 1,814 in March. 
The median price fell 4.6 percent to $209,000 from a year
earlier, the Illinois Association of Realtors said in a
statement yesterday. 
&#8220;While there has been some improvement in delinquencies
and home prices in some markets, we believe that significant
improvements will depend largely on an improving economy,&#8221;
Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. 
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. 
Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale of Bank One to JPMorgan
Chase in 2004. He and his wife Judith bought the Banks Street
property in 2000 for $4.7 million, according to records on the
Web site of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.

Honest Tea, partly owned by Coca-
Cola Co., may increase sales by at least 70 percent within a
year as it becomes available throughout the U.S., said Seth
Goldman, the tea maker&#8217;s co-founder and president. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the soda maker&#8217;s largest
bottler, and the majority of franchise distributors have
committed to the expansion, which includes some Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. locations, Goldman said today in an interview in Atlanta. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a ship leaving the port, now you&#8217;ve got a
turbo-charged engine,&#8221; Goldman said of the national
distribution. Honest Tea sold about 5 million cases last year,
for revenue of $47 million, he said. 
Coca-Cola bought a 40 percent stake in Bethesda, Maryland-
based Honest Tea in 2008 to tap into demand for healthier
beverages amid soft-drink volume sales declines. The company has
also invested in Innocent Drinks, a maker of fruit smoothies,
and coconut-water maker Zico Beverages LLC. 
Honest Tea, which produces U.S. Department of Agriculture-
certified organic teas, lemonades and children&#8217;s drinks, sold
the stake to get capital and access to the world&#8217;s largest
beverage distribution system. 
Coca-Cola bottlers distribute Honest Tea in the western and
northeastern U.S., and CVS Caremark Corp. recently agreed to
sell four flavors in its stores nationally, Goldman said. The
national expansion by Coca-Cola this year won&#8217;t include New York
and some Mid-Atlantic markets, where Honest Tea will keep its
existing independent distributors, he said. 
Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola,
said the company looks forward to supporting Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;work in
building the Honest Tea brand,&#8221; declining to elaborate.
Officials at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment. 
Coca-Cola helped finance a $1 million tea brewer at one of
its bottling plants to process Honest Tea, which steeps tea
leaves in hot water rather than mixing a manufactured powder,
Goldman said. 
Coca-Cola fell 43 cents to $53.88 at 4:07 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 5.5
percent this year.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Altana
AG won a jury verdict on the validity of their patent for the
heartburn drug Protonix. 
A federal jury in Newark, New Jersey, today rejected
arguments by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. that the patent covered an
obvious variation of earlier patented compounds in the same
family as Protonix. 
Teva and Sun conceded they infringed the patent, which left
the jury with only the question of whether the patent was issued
properly. Teva, in a statement, said it can make additional
invalidity arguments to U.S. District Judge Jose Linares and a
decision &#8220;independent of today&#8217;s jury verdict would be
sufficient to invalidate the patent.&#8221; 
Pfizer can now ask Linares to order Teva and Sun to stop
selling the drug until the patent expires in January. A second
trial would be held to determine what New York-based Pfizer
should be paid for profit lost since Teva and Sun began selling
cheaper versions of the drug two years ago. 
&#8220;If we are successful at the end of this process, we will
be seeking the full measure of our damages,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
spokesman for Pfizer, said in an interview. 
Reflux Disease 
Protonix, whose chemical name is pantoprazole sodium, is a
proton pump inhibitor that reduces the secretion of stomach
acids and is used to treat the effects of gastroesophageal
reflux disease, or GERD, which cases heartburn and chronic
ulcers in the esophagus. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, acquired Protonix
last year as part of its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth. 
Protonix sales reached $1.9 billion in 2007, and then fell
58 percent to $806 million in 2008, after Teva, based in Petah
Tikva, Israel, began selling its generic version. Mumbai-based
Sun entered the market in January 2008, a month after Teva. 
Not all of the generic sales went to those two companies.
Wyeth began selling Protonix under its chemical name as a so-
called authorized generic to challenge Teva and Sun sales. 
The patent, licensed to Wyeth, is owned by Altana&#8217;s
pharmaceutical business, which was bought by closely held
Nycomed Danmark ApS. AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec was the first
proton pump inhibitor. Others include AstraZeneca&#8217;s Nexium,
Novartis AG&#8217;s Prevacid and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Aciphex. 
Lawsuit Pending 
The U.S. and 16 states have a pending lawsuit claiming
Wyeth manipulated prices of the heartburn pill to increase
market share and defraud Medicare, the U.S. government health-
insurance program for the elderly. A judge in February denied
Pfizer&#8217;s request to dismiss the suit. 
Wholesale drug distributors also have sued Wyeth and
Altana, accusing them of misleading the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to obtain the patent and protect their monopoly
on Protonix. That case was put on hold until the patent case was
completed. 
The case is Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 04cv2355, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark).

Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s largest
brokerage, will probably close 120 additional U.S. offices to
eliminate overlapping locations in its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. 
U.S. outlets will shrink to around 750, the unit&#8217;s
president, Charles Johnston, said today in an interview at an
industry conference in New York. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney had
870 domestic locations as of March 31, down from 958 on June 30,
2009. The timing of some decisions will be driven by the
branches&#8217; leases, which are often 10-year terms, Johnston said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s overlap in just about every market in the country
between Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley offices,&#8221; Johnston
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no grand plan to dramatically shrink the
footprint, but there&#8217;s an awful lot of no-brainer decisions when
you do a deal like this.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global wealth-management unit reported
pretax income of $278 million for the first quarter, compared
with $119 million in same period a year earlier, before the
joint venture was completed. Chief Executive Officer James
Gorman, who led the unit before succeeding John Mack in January,
said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month that the
joint venture will play &#8220;an increasingly important role in our
growth and profitability.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster, Johnston
said. 
&#8216;Organic Growth&#8217; 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a large enough footprint in those
markets,&#8221; Johnston said. &#8220;We&#8217;d like it to be bigger, and
there&#8217;s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or you
can grow organically. There hasn&#8217;t been much that&#8217;s been
available to buy. We&#8217;ve talked about some deals, but we&#8217;re going
on the path of organic growth.&#8221; 
The unit had 18,140 advisers as of March 31 as turnover was
at &#8220;historic lows,&#8221; Johnston said. He said the number of
advisers will likely stay around 18,000 and revenue growth will
come from increases in adviser productivity. 
The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage&#8217;s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. Net new client assets in the unit
were $5.8 billion, the highest since the third quarter of 2008.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may be
better off cutting its losses instead of fighting what it terms
&#8220;unfounded&#8221; fraud claims, say professors of securities law who
have examined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
lawsuit against the bank. 
The most profitable firm in Wall Street history will
probably lose what is typically the first hurdle in court, a
motion to throw out the April 16 suit because it lacks legal
merit, the professors said in interviews this week. After that,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s risks will mount and its negotiating position
will weaken, they said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a very low probability that Goldman could get the
case dismissed,&#8221; said Thomas Hazen of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose books include a two-volume
treatise on broker-dealer law. &#8220;Every pretrial motion the SEC
wins, Goldman gets one step closer to losing.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is the first major Wall Street firm accused
by regulators of fraud connected to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market. The SEC&#8217;s allegation that Goldman Sachs
defrauded investors sparked a 13 percent, one-day decline in its
shares. The New York-based firm, led by Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, 55, said it will vigorously contest the claims.
It must weigh the risks of a drawn-out legal battle against the
benefits of a more immediate resolution.

Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.
fell after releasing earnings reports that showed a rebound in
technology spending by companies and online buying by consumers
is less robust than analysts had predicted. 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, said third-
quarter sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, missing the
most optimistic revenue estimates. Amazon.com, the biggest
online retailer, said operating income this quarter may be as
low as $220 million, compared with $322.2 million, the average
prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
While Microsoft and Amazon.com had rising sales and profit
last quarter, neither lived up to analysts&#8217; most bullish
predictions. Optimism rose last week after Intel Corp. forecast
record profit margins in 2010, indicating that a revival in
computer demand is gathering steam. Results from Apple Inc. and
Best Buy Co. this week reflected robust consumer purchasing. 
&#8220;With technology in general and Microsoft in particular,
you&#8217;re going to get this issue where it&#8217;s not good enough or
it&#8217;s already in the stock and it sells off a little bit,&#8221; said
Dave Stepherson, a fund manager at Hardesty Capital Management
in Baltimore. Hardesty manages $700 million in assets, including
Microsoft shares. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a lot of momentum in technology
stocks.&#8221; 
Shares Decline 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 3.6 percent
to $30.27 in extended trading after the report. The shares had
risen 6 cents to $31.39 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.
Amazon.com, based in Seattle, dropped 5.9 percent to $141.30
after closing at $150.09. 
Amazon stock traded in Germany fell 4.9 percent to $142.70
as of 10:09 a.m. in Frankfurt, while Microsoft declined 3.2
percent to $30.40 from yesterday&#8217;s Nasdaq closing price of
$31.39. 
Third-quarter net income at Microsoft rose 35 percent to
$4.01 billion, or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast
of 42 cents in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded
the $14.4 billion average in the survey, reflecting rising
demand for Windows 7, the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship
operating system. 
Still, investors were expecting more, Stepherson said. For
the second straight quarter, much of Microsoft&#8217;s strength came
from consumers, while business spending hasn&#8217;t rebounded with
vigor. Sales of Office and server software missed estimates at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG. 
Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear contracts, was
$12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was $12.8 billion,
according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jefferies  Co. 
The numbers suggest corporate customers are holding off on
big orders that stretch over many years. 
&#8216;Really Poor&#8217; 
&#8220;The deferred revenue was really poor,&#8221; said Brent Thill,
an analyst with UBS AG in San Francisco. &#8220;Microsoft is one of
the last companies in technology to say enterprise spending is
turning. Everyone thought they&#8217;d put up better growth.&#8221; 
Amazon.com said operating income will be $220 million to
$320 million, below the average estimate in the Bloomberg
survey. The company is struggling to extract favorable pricing
from its suppliers who, with improving demand, don&#8217;t have to
offer as many discounts, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Financial LP in New York. 
As more consumers snap up digital books and other media --
buying fewer of the physical products that have long been
Amazon.com&#8217;s mainstay -- the company faces increased competition
from rivals such as Apple, Gillis said. 
&#8220;Amazon is not likely to experience the same
profitability and leadership position in digital media that it
enjoys selling physical books, movies and music,&#8221; Gillis said. 
Earlier Gains 
First-quarter sales of $7.13 billion and profit of $299
million, or 66 cents a share, beat analysts&#8217; estimates. The
company&#8217;s shares have climbed 90 percent in the past year,
double the gain by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Amazon.com and Microsoft are not the only companies whose
quarterly earnings reports compared poorly to those of Intel and
Apple. Google Inc., the biggest seller of Internet advertising,
posted its biggest drop since December 2008 last week after
reporting profit that missed the highest analyst estimates.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The leading Internet stocks so far all reported fairly
good results and guidance and still saw their stocks drop,&#8221;
said Fred Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co. in Boca Raton,
Florida. &#8220;The stock market expectations for where technology
stocks should trade may have temporarily gotten ahead of
themselves.&#8221;

investment; investigators wrote to Gupta, who said last month
he was stepping down as a Goldman director, to say they had
found out about the tip through an intercepted phone call
between Gupta and Rajaratnam, the newspaper said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and U.S.
Senator Carl Levin fired opening shots ahead of a congressional
hearing this week, releasing conflicting evidence of the
investment bank&#8217;s tactics during the mortgage market&#8217;s collapse. 
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, posted internal Goldman Sachs e-
mails on his website yesterday that he said show the firm &#8220;made
a lot of money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Goldman
Sachs responded with documents indicating the firm lost money on
mortgages in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market
would fall. 
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
current and former Goldman Sachs employees will have to face
questions from Levin&#8217;s panel against the backdrop of fraud
claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
regulator sued the firm on April 16, saying it defrauded
investors when selling a debt instrument tied to mortgages. 
Goldman Sachs, which contests the SEC&#8217;s claims, said
Levin&#8217;s committee has &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; evidence and jumped to
conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
&#8220;Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not simply
market-makers, they were self-interested promoters of risky and
complicated financial schemes that helped trigger the crisis,&#8221;
Levin, 75, said in a statement released with the e-mails. 
One of the e-mails provided by Levin yesterday shows
Blankfein telling colleagues on Nov. 18, 2007, that the firm was
making more money from its so-called short bets on mortgages
than it lost on its investments related to home loans. 
&#8216;Mortgage Mess&#8217; 
&#8220;Of course we didn&#8217;t dodge the mortgage mess,&#8221; Blankfein
wrote in an e-mail dated Nov. 18, 2007, that was among eight
pages of documents made public by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &#8220;We lost money, then made more
than we lost because of shorts. Also, it&#8217;s not over, so who
knows how it will turn out ultimately.&#8221; 
Another document contains an exchange between Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s
president and chief operating officer, about the fixed-income
division&#8217;s profit and loss statement in July 2007. Cohn&#8217;s e-mail
describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage unit is up &#8220;in the index
book,&#8221; while recording writedowns on residential mortgages and
collateralized debt obligations. One method the firm used to
make bets against the mortgage market was to take short
positions on the so-called ABX index. 
&#8220;Tells you what might be happening to people who don&#8217;t
have the big short,&#8221; Viniar replies, according to the
documents. 
Losses Overwhelmed Gains 
Documents released yesterday by Goldman Sachs show that the
firm&#8217;s gains from shorting subprime mortgages in 2007 were
overwhelmed by losses in 2008 when higher-quality mortgages
suffered more than the firm anticipated. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs did not have access to any special
information that caused us to know that the U.S. housing market
would collapse,&#8221; the firm stated in an &#8220;executive summary&#8221; of
its arguments released yesterday. &#8220;As a result of the spread of
the crisis from subprime to all residential mortgages, Goldman
Sachs had overall net losses of approximately $1.7 billion with
respect to residential mortgage-related products for fiscal
2008.&#8221; 
A lawyer for Goldman Sachs wrote a letter to Levin April 23
asking the subcommittee to warn the firm of any information the
panel plans to release so it has a chance to respond. The letter
followed Levin&#8217;s statement at a hearing the same day that
&#8220;investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not market makers
helping clients; they were self-interested promoters of risky
and complicated financial schemes that were a major part of the
2008 crisis.&#8221; 
&#8216;Already Drawn Conclusions&#8217; 
&#8220;The statement suggests that you and the subcommittee have
already drawn conclusions about the conduct of Goldman Sachs,&#8221;
K. Lee Blalack II from the law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP wrote
to Levin. &#8220;We strongly disagree with your statement at today&#8217;s
hearing and believe that, if we were provided an opportunity to
respond to your specific findings, Goldman Sachs could produce
to you information that establishes that your findings are
incorrect.&#8221; 
Blalack, a partner in the Washington office of O&#8217;Melveny 
Myers, is a former chief counsel and staff director of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, according to his
biography on the firm&#8217;s website. 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Making Markets 
Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. 
&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; 
Pecora Commission 
The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre,
are accused of violating in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s suit filed on April 16. 
The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. 
Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell Levin&#8217;s panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. 
SEC Enforcement Chief 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Wall Street Journal reported April 23, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear
whether Khuzami reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related
to CDOs, the newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because
the terms of his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing
Deutsche Bank, John Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg
News. 
Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings may have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. 
Tougher Questioning 
Blankfein may get tougher questioning than he received in
front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by former
California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January, Geisst
said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. 
&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; 
Levin has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. 
&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; 
Blum said the permanent subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels in which senators and their staffs cooperate across
party lines. 
Parade of Critics 
Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; 
Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. 
A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. 
Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at the
permanent subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. 
Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. 
Budget Watchdog 
Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; 
Created in 1948, the panel was led in the 1950s by then-
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who alleged that
communists had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy
later was censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003
&#8220;destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the
infiltration of our government.&#8221; 
In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. 
Enron, Saddam Hussein 
Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. 
The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. 
The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221;

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, the
largest Italian insurer, named Cesare Geronzi, the outgoing
chairman of its largest shareholder, Mediobanca SpA, as its new
chairman and Giovanni Perissinotto as its sole Chief Executive. 
Geronzi, 75, replaces 85-year-old Antoine Bernheim, who was
named honorary president at Generali&#8217;s annual meeting yesterday
in Trieste, Italy. Perissinotto&#8217;s former co-CEO, Sergio
Balbinot, now will lead the company&#8217;s international insurance
units. 
&#8220;We expect the effect of the Geronzi&#8217;s appointment to be
negative for the shares,&#8221; Fabrizio Croce, a Zurich-based
analyst with Kepler Capital Markets SA with a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on
the stock, wrote in a note April 23. &#8220;Investment funds, Anglo-
Saxon investors and ethical funds could have a potential issue
with the appointment and may reduce their positions.&#8221; 
Some investors are concerned with the influence Milan-based
Mediobanca, Italy&#8217;s biggest investment bank, has over the
insurer. Geronzi yesterday said Generali doesn&#8217;t plan a capital
increase, which might dilute Mediobanca&#8217;s 14 percent stake. He
also ruled out a merger with Mediobanca. 
Still, the decision to make Perissinotto, 56, the company&#8217;s
single chief executive &#8220;will satisfy investors worried by
Mediobanca&#8217;s strength on the board,&#8221; Edoardo Liuni an analyst
at NuovoMercato.it said in a phone interview after the
appointments. &#8220;Perissinotto will ensure independent leadership
at the insurer.&#8221; 
&#8216;Punished&#8217; 
Bernheim, who was chairman for eight years, said he
regretted Mediobanca&#8217;s decision to replace him. 
&#8220;Sometimes when you work well, you are punished,&#8221; said
Bernheim, who has spent almost four decades with the company.
&#8220;This is an example.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t elaborate the comment. 
Geronzi, speaking at a press conference after the annual
meeting, said that Bernheim&#8217;s words were understandable given
his long tenure at the insurer. &#8220;I appreciate Bernheim, as
witnessed by his appointment as honorary president,&#8221; he said. 
Bernheim was moved to tears several times during his one-
and-a-half hour speech that was translated from French. He said
he wished &#8220;all the best&#8221; to the new management. 
Geronzi was reinstated as chairman of Mediobanca by
investors in 2007 after a conviction in connection with the
bankruptcy of property and tourism company Italcase. He was
acquitted of the charges in 2009 on appeal. Geronzi, who won&#8217;t
have an executive role at Generali, was also formerly a Bank of
Italy official and chairman of Rome-based Capitalia SpA. 
Nagel, Caltagirone, Bollore 
Generali appointed non-executive deputy chairmen at the
annual meeting: Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel; Francesco Gaetano
Caltagirone, the chairman of publishing and media company
Caltagirone Editore Spa; and French billionaire Vincent Bollore. 
Enel SpA CEO Paolo Scaroni, Banco Espanol de Credito SA
Chairwoman Ana Patricia Botin, Tod&#8217;s SpA Chairman Diego della
Valle, and De Agostini SpA CEO Lorenzo Pellicioli also were
named board members. 
Generali said first-quarter gross premiums rose 16 percent,
boosted by its life-insurance business and a recovery of Italian
operations. 
Total premiums increased to 20.8 billion euros ($27.8
billion) in the first three months of 2010 from the year
earlier, Perissinotto said. Italian premiums rose 22 percent to
5.4 billion euros because of a 34 percent increase in life-
insurance business. 
&#8220;We have seen positive elements in the first quarter,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We hope for a consolidation of the economic recovery
that would allow us to increase our profitability.&#8221; 
Greece, Spain, Ireland 
Generali has declined 11 percent this year, compared with
the 2.2 percent increase in the Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance
Index. The company has a market value of 26 billion euros. 
Generali has 900 million euros of &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece,
Spain, Portugal and Ireland, the company said yesterday. 
Generali, which will release its first-quarter results on
May 12, is expanding in emerging markets, including China and
the Middle East, as it recovers from the economic crisis.
Perissinotto said that the external growth is a priority for
Generali. 
The insurer wants to increase its business in Russia, where
it owns a 38.5 percent holding in Ingosstrakh. Perissinotto said
he aims to resume talks with Oleg Deripaska, who owns the
remainder, about raising the stake. 
Generali doesn&#8217;t plan to boost its stake in Banco Santander
SA, Perissinotto said.

Wall Street&#8217;s smartest will meet
the Senate&#8217;s toughest at a hearing next week that could provide
a seminal moment in the reckoning after the financial crisis. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, and six current and former employees of
his firm will face a grilling from the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Led by Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has
served in the U.S. Senate for more than 30 years, the panel has
a reputation for thorough research. 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. It comes after
regulators sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre,
alleging fraud in the sale of a mortgage-linked investment as
the market for such investments turned, accusations the firm
denies. 
&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; 
The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and Tourre are accused of
violating in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit filed
on April 16. 
SEC Accusations 
The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. 
Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell the panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. 
Levin today released Goldman Sachs e-mails obtained by his
committee that he said demonstrate the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Among them was
an e-mail in which Blankfein said, &#8220;We lost money, then made
more than we lost because of shorts.&#8221; 
&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
today released information on the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
profits and losses in 2007 and 2008. The information shows
Goldman Sachs had net losses of $1.2 billion in residential
mortgage-related products in the period. While the firm
generated more money than it lost on mortgage positions in 2007,
losses overwhelmed gains in the first quarter of 2008, the
documents show. 
&#8220;The U.S. Senate subcommittee has cherry-picked just four
e-mails from the almost 20 million pages of documents and e-
mails provided to it by Goldman Sachs,&#8221; van Praag said. &#8220;It is
concerning that the subcommittee seems to have reached its
conclusion even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
Implications for Regulation 
Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings could have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. 
Blankfein, 55, may get tougher questioning than he received
in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by
former California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January,
Geisst said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. 
&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; 
Levin, 75, has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. 
Homework Done 
&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; 
Blum said the Permanent Subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels with bipartisan cooperation between the senators and
their staffs. 
Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; 
Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. 
A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. 
&#8216;Lose-Lose&#8217; 
The hearing presents a &#8220;lose-lose situation&#8221; for Goldman
Sachs, Geisst said, because the firm is fighting a battle over
its reputation as well as the law. 
&#8220;If they answer with generalities and maintain that they
haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, then it just gets worse for them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If they do admit that they&#8217;ve actually done something
wrong, specifically, it won&#8217;t go well for them.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Making Markets 
Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; 
&#8220;Some of these things Goldman did had no useful
function,&#8221; said Richard Sylla, a financial historian and
economics professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of
Business. &#8220;They have that problem even if they didn&#8217;t do
anything illegal.&#8221; 
Five Goldman Sachs senior executives sold $65.4 million of
stock after the firm received notice of possible fraud
allegations last year from the SEC, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment on the sales when contacted by Bloomberg
News. The firm has said it didn&#8217;t disclose receiving a Wells
notice from the SEC because it didn&#8217;t think it was material. 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Journal reported yesterday, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear whether Khuzami
reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related to CDOs, the
newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because the terms of
his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing Deutsche Bank, John
Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg News. 
Roach, Ashdown 
Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at
Permanent Subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. 
Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. 
Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; 
McCarthy Censure 
Created in 1948, the panel was led by then-Senator Joseph
McCarthy of Wisconsin in the 1950s, who alleged that communists
had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy later was
censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003 &#8220;destroyed
careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of
our government.&#8221; 
In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. 
Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. 
Focus on Taxes 
The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. 
The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221;

White House officials and Democratic
lawmakers, bracing for a Senate showdown on Wall Street
oversight, seized on internal e-mails from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to push for new curbs that would include a ban on
proprietary trading. 
&#8220;These e-mails signify that there are all kinds of
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that Wall Street is
working for its clients and working against its clients in the
same sort of bundled toxic securities,&#8221; Senator Sherrod Brown,
a Democrat from Ohio, said today on ABC&#8217;s This Week. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why we need really strong reform that will separate the
proprietary trading from banking functions.&#8221; 
The e-mails show that the New York-based firm &#8220;made a lot
of money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; said Carl
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations and published the e-mails
yesterday. Democrats are using the revelations to bolster
support for Senator Christopher Dodd&#8217;s financial overhaul, which
faces a test vote in the Senate tomorrow. At least one
Republican vote is needed to open debate. 
A ban on proprietary trading, named the Volcker rule after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who&#8217;s advising the
President Barack Obama, is &#8220;highly relevant&#8221; to ending
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, Austan Goolsbee, a White
House economic adviser, said today on ABC&#8217;s program &#8220;This
Week.&#8221; 
Blankfein at Hearing 
Levin&#8217;s panel is scheduled to question Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six other current and former
Goldman Sachs employees on Tuesday. The firm is battling an
April 16 fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors in
a collateralized debt obligation about the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. in assembling the deal and its intention to
bet against the CDO. 
Goldman Sachs has called the SEC suit &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; The firm responded to Levin&#8217;s publication of the e-
mails with documents indicating the firm lost money on mortgages
in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market would fall. 
&#8220;The CEO of Goldman Sachs is not going to win any
popularity contests, when over a period that ordinary Americans&#8217;
pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were
actually making significant money off of it,&#8221; Goolsbee said. 
The SEC&#8217;s case and the e-mails heighten the need to pass
regulatory reform, Dodd, who chairs the Senate Banking
Committee, said today in an interview on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the
Press.&#8221; Dodd has been working with Richard Shelby, the top
Republican on the committee, since last year to try to broker a
compromise on the legislation. 
Shelby and Dodd 
Shelby, also speaking on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;, said that
while he and Dodd are &#8220;conceptually very, very close&#8221; on the
legislation, he doubts they will reach an agreement by tomorrow.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to end, once and for all, the casino atmosphere on
Wall Street,&#8221; he said. 
Larry Summers, the director of the White House National
Economic Council, said the e-mails underscore &#8220;what is at the
center&#8221; of Obama&#8217;s plan for overhauling financial regulation.
That includes &#8220;the importance of things being in the open,&#8221;
and of knowing &#8220;who&#8217;s got a stake in success, who&#8217;s got a stake
in failure,&#8221; Summers said on the CBS program &#8220;Face The
Nation.&#8221; 
Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and member of
the Senate Banking Committee who helped write parts of the bill,
said the e-mails &#8220;certainly do not read well.&#8221; 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
&#8220;I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed
in the e-mails, but I think we&#8217;re better off waiting to see
exactly what has taken place,&#8221; Corker said. &#8220;There are some
conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked
at, but I&#8217;d rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds
before making any judgments.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a really uncomfortable week, a
challenging week, for CEO Lloyd Blankfein,&#8221; Jon Corzine, the
former Democratic New Jersey governor and senator who ran
Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, said in an interview broadcast
today on ABC News&#8217;s Good Morning America. &#8220;The silver lining is
this is going to reinforce the need for moving forward with
financial regulatory reform.&#8221;

Hunt</headline><body>
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose
exceptional cachet and clout have been enhanced by its role in
public policy, suddenly is a pariah in government and political
circles. 
Let&#8217;s assume, for a moment, that the company prevails in
the fraud suit brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, that no one was misled about the content of the
product it sold, only about the background. 
Also assume that, as Goldman Sachs executives insisted
last week, most of their customers are supportive of the firm,
and any short-term losses will be negligible. 
Still, the Goldman Sachs brand, one of the most
prestigious in the world, corporate or otherwise, is tarnished,
perhaps indelibly. If the company believes it can tough its way
through this, it&#8217;s as insular as critics charge. 
For starters, the fraud suit, which Goldman Sachs says is
without merit, may not be the only problem facing the company.
The Germans and British are already piling on, and reportedly
Goldman Sachs is nervous about the full-scale inquiry into the
Wall Street fiasco by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Getting in the cross hairs of the panel&#8217;s
Democratic chairman, Michigan&#8217;s Carl Levin, one of the
toughest, straightest shooters in Congress, is cause for
concern. 
Stellar Values 
For context, professionally I&#8217;ve known a half-dozen top
former Goldman Sachs executives; they&#8217;re all able and
thoughtful. The one I know well has stellar values. 
Also, despite working for two of the great financial news
organizations in the world for more than four decades, I&#8217;ve
never covered Wall Street; I cover politics, a proud
journalistic hack. 
In this case, the prism of politics is illuminating. The
global Goldman Sachs mystique has been enhanced by the number
of executives tapped for leading government jobs. Treasury
Secretaries Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and
Henry Paulson in the George W. Bush administration were former
Goldman Sachs chairmen, as was Stephen Friedman, the top White
House economic adviser during the Bush presidency. There is a
plethora of Goldman alums sprinkled throughout the Obama
administration. 
Until recently there was no better credential for
government service than a Goldman Sachs background; now the G
is more like the forbidden A in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;The
Scarlet Letter.&#8221; 
Lethal Background 
If there were an opening today for a Federal Reserve
governor or a deputy Treasury secretary or for a prominent
White House economic role, a Goldman Sachs background,
administration officials privately admit, would be lethal. 
&#8220;Clearly, they&#8217;ve become a toxic asset,&#8221; says Simon Johnson, a former International Monetary Fund economist who is
now a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management. 
The fraud charges were the final straw in the building
resentment against Goldman Sachs; synthetic collateralized debt
obligations aren&#8217;t the stuff of backyard barbecue chatter or
debates at a bar. The public and political resentment, as one
crisis manager put it, grows out of the sense that Goldman
Sachs not only hasn&#8217;t &#8220;shared the pain&#8221; experienced by the
rest of America, but has &#8220;profited from it.&#8221; (Goldman Sachs,
which reported record profit last week, did take a government
handout in 2008 and repaid it in full with interest). 
Political Giving 
In this environment, a firm&#8217;s political standing
dissipates. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s political-action committee gave
$290,500 to congressional candidates last month as the
legislature weighed the financial-regulation overhaul.
President Barack Obama shook the Goldman Sachs money tree for
almost $1 million in the last presidential campaign. 
There is now a bipartisan scramble to strike distance from
the Wall Street powerhouse. Mark Kirk, Republican candidate for
an Illinois U.S. Senate seat, says he&#8217;ll refund any
contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. His Democratic
opponents say that isn&#8217;t sufficient. 
In the Arkansas Senate Democratic primary, Lieutenant
Governor Bill Halter assailed incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln
for getting money from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s PAC. Lincoln just
canceled a plan to hold a fundraising lunch at Goldman. In the
California gubernatorial race, opponents are assailing former
EBay Inc. (EBAY) Chairwoman Meg Whitman for being an ex-Goldman Sachs
director. The Whitman camp&#8217;s response: Her critics have Goldman
ties, too. 
Keeping the Money 
Although Obama may be capitalizing on the anti-Wall Street
wave with his regulatory overhaul bill, Republicans such as
South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint are demanding he give back
the big bucks he got from Goldman Sachs in the last campaign;
he won&#8217;t. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the guest of
honor at a private Park Avenue cocktails soiree for wealthy
Obama supporters last weekend, surely wasn&#8217;t pleased it was
reported that a Goldman Sachs partner was present. 
Whatever the legalities of the fraud charge, it looks
awful, more like the doings in a Las Vegas casino than on Wall
Street, and more like Gordon Gekko greed than the legitimate
economic interest to hedge against risk. Goldman Sachs contends
the SEC&#8217;s case boils down to the actions of Fabrice Tourre,
then a 28-year-old vice president, who while putting together
the multibillion-dollar deal was writing e-mails, according to
the SEC, exclaiming that the &#8220;whole building is about to
collapse,&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;surreal&#8221; that no one understands
these instruments. 
If he was the culprit, who was the enabler? 
Goldman Scapegoat 
With no inside knowledge, but based on years of watching
politicians and political institutions respond to such crises,
there are two certainties about what&#8217;s going on in the
corporate suites of Goldman Sachs. There is likely near-
universal consensus that much of this is unfair and the company
is being made a scapegoat by pandering politicians. 
The established order says we&#8217;re going to fight this with
all our considerable resources, while continuing to flourish
financially because we&#8217;re better. 
Deeper, however, there is another, more profound debate.
Others, perhaps privately, realize this is a fantasy. If there
is a way to settle the fraud case without risking huge
financial exposure, it has to be considered. Someone with Paul Volcker-like credibility has to be enlisted to review the
company&#8217;s culture and practices; contrition and change at the
top are unavoidable.

Newly disclosed Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. internal e-mails cast light on how the investment bank
devised collateralized debt obligations called Abacus, including
one at the center of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud lawsuit. 
The e-mails show employees discussed which outside firms
would be &#8220;easiest&#8221; to work with while creating Abacus CDOs to
bet against the housing market. 
The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin,
the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, as the panel prepares to
question Goldman Sachs executives today. In one message, a
Goldman Sachs worker asked which outside firm would most likely
approve assets that hedge fund Paulson  Co. wanted to include
in a CDO and bet against. 
&#8220;The way I look at it, the easiest manager to work with
should be used for our own axes,&#8221; the author wrote in December
2006, using industry jargon that can refer to the firm&#8217;s 
financial interest in a deal. The writer also expressed concern 
that two firms being considered weren&#8217;t likely to sign off on 
Paulson&#8217;s suggested assets. &#8220;They will never agree to the type 
of names [P]aulson want to use[.]&#8221; 
The Senate committee&#8217;s investigators have pored through
about 2 million Goldman Sachs documents as lawmakers prepare to
question Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
other current and former employees. They include Fabrice Tourre,
the banker at the center of the SEC&#8217;s complaint. 
&#8216;Be Sensitive&#8217; 
In one e-mail, Tourre emphasized the firm should focus on
serving Paulson to reap greater profits. 
&#8220;We need to be sensitive of the profitability of these
trades vs. profitability of abacus,&#8221; Tourre wrote in one e-
mail, according to a copy released by Levin. &#8220;We should
prioritize the higher profit margin businesses with Paulson.&#8221; 
The e-mail about picking the easiest manager was part of an
exchange with Tourre, according to a list of exhibits released
by the lawmaker. The author wasn&#8217;t identified. 
In another December 2006 e-mail, Tourre discussed other
business opportunities for Abacus, outlining a strategy in which
Goldman Sachs would &#8220;&#8216;rent&#8217; our Abacus platform to
counterparties&#8221; that wanted to short the market. 
The messages show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its own
interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221;
Levin said. While his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for
determining whether there was any criminal activity, it will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the
SEC or the Justice Department. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, claiming the New
York-based bank misled investors in a CDO about the role Paulson
played in assembling the deal and the fund&#8217;s intent to bet that
its underlying assets would lose value. The hedge fund, run by
billionaire investor John Paulson, wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs is fighting the SEC&#8217;s claims, which it says
are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; In prepared testimony for
today&#8217;s hearing, Blankfein said the firm didn&#8217;t bet against
clients and didn&#8217;t &#8220;make a massive short&#8221; against the housing
market.

The cost to protect the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and two other derivatives dealers jumped for the fourth day as
the U.S. Senate considers a bill that may curb their trading
revenue. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs, the bank facing
fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, jumped to the highest in almost a year. Contracts on
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit reached
the highest since August, and JPMorgan swaps climbed the most in
more than 11 weeks. 
The legislation would damp one of Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable businesses, in which Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of
America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. earned an estimated
$28 billion in revenue last year, according to filings with the
Federal Reserve and people familiar with their income sources. 
The Senate was set to hold a test vote today on legislation
that would force the most actively traded derivatives to
exchanges or trading platforms that resemble exchanges, mandate
banks to hold more capital on other derivatives trades and
require commercial banks to wall off swaps trading desks. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re talking about a pretty significant contributor to
earnings,&#8221; said Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service in New York. &#8220;If they lost a material portion
of that, it obviously wouldn&#8217;t be good. The problem with
exchange trading for dealers is that they would be giving up
profits without a concomitant decrease in risk to compensate for
it.&#8221; 
Test Vote 
Senator Richard Shelby, a lead negotiator on the financial-
reform bill, said Republicans will block Democrats&#8217; efforts to
begin debate on the measure in a test vote today. 
The derivatives provisions are part of a broader financial-
regulation bill intended to prevent a repeat of the credit
crisis that led to the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
the near collapse of Bear Stearns Cos. and the government
bailout of insurer American International Group. 
The legislation includes measures empowering federal
agencies to dissolve failed systemically important financial
firms to prevent their collapse from disrupting the economy. 
JPMorgan alone could lose as much as $3 billion a year in
revenue if it doesn&#8217;t combat the move of derivatives trades to
exchanges, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a March 15 report. 
&#8220;The banking system is on a journey to being much more
utility-like,&#8221; Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive officer at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said today at the Milken
Global Institute conference in Los Angeles. &#8220;What&#8217;s likely to
happen over the next few months is much more emphasis on
stability and less emphasis on efficiency and innovation.&#8221; 
Hearing Tomorrow 
Five-year credit-default swaps on Goldman jumped 23 basis
points to 167 basis points as of 4:35 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. That&#8217;s the highest
since May 2009, CMA DataVision prices show. 
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is set
to question Goldman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former employees of the firm
tomorrow. The SEC says Goldman Sachs and executive director
Fabrice Tourre misled investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation about the role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co.,
which bet the CDO would collapse. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the panel, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. 
Goldman swaps have jumped 76 basis points since April 15,
the day before the SEC announced its fraud suit. 
Swaps on JPMorgan climbed 17 basis points to a mid-price of
89.5 basis points, the most since Feb. 4, CMA prices show.
Morgan Stanley swaps jumped 34 to 184.5. Contracts on Merrill
rose 37 to 193 and Bank of America swaps increased 37 to 162,
CMA prices show. 
Markit CDX Index 
Swaps on Citigroup Inc. rose 21 basis points to a mid-price
of 183, Phoenix prices show. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk rose to
the highest in two months. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index Series 14, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 2.2 basis points to a mid-price of 91
basis points as of 5:23 p.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by shareholders over a collateralized-debt obligation known as
Abacus 2007-AC1 that prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit this month. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the truth about Abacus or the
bank&#8217;s financial condition, investors said in the complaint
filed today in federal court in Manhattan. &#8220;As news of
Goldman&#8217;s misconduct reached the market, Goldman stock
immediately plummeted,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
When the SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, its shares
fell 13 percent to close at $160.70. That case centers on
whether the New York-based firm should have told investors that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying securities in
the CDO -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. 
&#8220;Defendants omitted and/or misrepresented material facts
concerning Goldman&#8217;s participation in structuring the CDO to
help one client who was short the CDO while simultaneously
selling the CDO to another client,&#8221; investors said in today&#8217;s
complaint. 
Investor Ilene Richman filed the lawsuit on behalf of
others who bought Goldman Sachs shares from Oct. 15 to April 16. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment today. 
The securities-fraud suit, filed by San Diego-based law
firm Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP, also names as defendants
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar and President Gary D. Cohn. 
SEC Investigation 
The bank concealed from investors that it was being
investigated by the SEC over the CDO late last year, at the same
time it launched a public-relations campaign touting its
&#8220;responsible business practices&#8221; to combat negative publicity
over $16 billion in bonuses it was scheduled to pay employees,
according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the SEC probe in its third-
quarter filing with the commission on Nov. 4, according to the
complaint. 
On April 22, two investors separately sued Goldman Sachs
officers and directors, including Blankfein, on behalf of the
bank in state court in Manhattan for permitting the company to
enter into a series of CDOs, including Abacus 2007-AC1, tied to
the subprime market. Another so-called derivative lawsuit was
filed against the officers and directors today in federal court
in Manhattan. 
Goldman Sachs fell $5.37, or 3.4 percent, to $152.03 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The case is Richman v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 10-03461,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, made an
estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against
mortgage-linked securities, including some it created, a U.S.
senator said today. 
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released e-mails and
other documents that he said show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its
own interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients.&#8221; 
The documents precede a showdown on Capitol Hill tomorrow
between Levin&#8217;s panel and seven current and former Goldman Sachs
employees. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and
Fabrice Tourre, 31, an executive director who was named in the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud lawsuit
against the firm, are among Goldman employees set to answer
questions. 
&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and we
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said at a briefing for reporters
today on tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. &#8220;We think there are a number of
banks engaged in similar conduct but we had to focus on one.&#8221; 
The subcommittee estimated that Goldman Sachs generated
$3.7 billion from its short bets on a declining mortgage market
in 2007, Levin said. The figure doesn&#8217;t take into account losses
they suffered on mortgage-related securities they held, he said. 
SEC, Justice Department 
Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether there was any criminal activity, although he said the
panel will decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter
to the SEC or the Justice Department. 
Blankfein will tell the committee tomorrow that the firm
didn&#8217;t wager against clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against
the housing market, according to the prepared text of his
remarks. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will say, according to the text. 
While the firm disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;We have to do a better job of striking
the balance between what an informed client believes is
important to his or her investing goals and what the public
believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; 
Among the evidence Levin presented today was an internal e-
mail about a March 2007 presentation to the board of directors
that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk started
the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB- rated
mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; 
An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Daniel Sparks, who
ran the mortgage business at the time and is among those
scheduled to testify, includes the comment &#8220;real bad feeling
across European sales about some of the trades we did with
clients. The damage this has done to our franchise is very
significant. Aggregate loss of our clients on just these 5
trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; 
Michael Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
structured products group who is also to appear tomorrow,
boasted in his 2007 performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to
clients who demanded that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program
as clients tried to gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring
to the name for Goldman&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those
were unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of
millions of dollars.&#8221; 
Ties That Bind 
In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from institutional clients. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
&#8216;Incalculable Harm&#8217; 
&#8220;In a number of ways they contributed to the collapse of
this economy,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman Sachs and
others helped inject into our financial system has done
incalculable harm.&#8221; 
While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package that is set to be considered by the Senate
this week, he said he thinks it could be strengthened. He has
proposed an amendment that would help resolve the conflicts of
interest among Wall Street firms that he said are embodied in
the documents. He also endorsed banning financial firms from
engaging in so-called naked credit default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the credit. 
After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
website on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. 
$68 Million Bonus 
Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a debt instrument tied to
mortgages by failing to inform them of the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. The company said on April 24 that Levin&#8217;s
committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence it released and jumped
to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Pecora Era 
While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. 
&#8220;Looking at this crisis, it&#8217;s hard not to agree with the
conclusion of another congressional committee, which found &#8216;the
result of the unregulated activities of the investment bankers
were enormous,&#8217;&#8221; Levin said in the briefing with journalists.
&#8220;That conclusion came in 1934, when the Senate looked into the
reasons for the Great Depression.&#8221;

Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, will tell a
Senate committee tomorrow that the firm didn&#8217;t wager against
clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against the housing market. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
according to a prepared text of his remarks. 
Blankfein and six other current and former Goldman Sachs
executives will testify in front of the panel about their
practices in the mortgage-securities market leading up to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The firm
faces a fraud lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange
Commission that accuses it of failing to inform investors about
the role played by a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., in the deal. 
&#8220;As you know, ten days ago, the SEC announced a civil
action against Goldman Sachs in connection with a specific
transaction,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the text of his
remarks. &#8220;It was one of the worst days in my professional life,
as I know it was for every person at our firm.&#8221; 
Blankfein will say that New York-based Goldman Sachs has
been a &#8220;client-centered firm for 140 years and if our clients
believe that we don&#8217;t deserve their trust, we cannot survive.&#8221; 
&#8216;Complicated Transaction&#8217; 
While the firm says it disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
&#8220;I also recognize how such a complicated transaction may look
to many people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do
a better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
Blankfein will also say that the firm favors more
transparency for the public and regulators and is supporting the
creation of clearinghouses for eligible derivatives. He also
said the firm recognizes that many in the U.S. are skeptical
about investment banks. 
&#8220;What we and other banks, rating agencies and regulators
failed to do was sound the alarm that there was too much lending
and too much leverage in the system -- that credit had become
too cheap,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the remarks.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, said a bankruptcy court hearing
on its auction process will be delayed five days to give the
company time to consider competing investment plans. 
Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. are each leading groups that want to back General Growth,
which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the
past year. The hearing was postponed to May 4 from April 29,
Chicago-based General Growth said today in a statement. 
The delay will allow General Growth to speak with its
investor committees and &#8220;other parties concerning the full
range of offers, proposals and commitments received and complete
its assessment thereof,&#8221; the company said. 
Simon, spurned in February when it offered to buy General
Growth outright for $10 billion, earlier this month said it
would match the terms of a bankruptcy-exit proposal led by
Brookfield. Each plan would keep General Growth an independent
company, and would need bankruptcy court approval. Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, has said it is still interested in a
full takeover of its rival. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., seeking
to reduce assets tied to the declining U.S. housing market,
urged its sales force in 2006 and 2007 to sell those products to
clients, newly disclosed internal e-mails show. 
The e-mails, including communications from Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, show that employees discussed how to
&#8220;arm&#8221; salespeople to shed bonds the firm found too risky to
hold. The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin
in connection with a hearing where current and former managers
testified about the firm&#8217;s role in the financial crisis. 
Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, grilled the executives
about the firm&#8217;s bets against the housing market and its
disclosure to clients. 
In one of the e-mails, Blankfein asked whether employees
were doing enough to sell bonds backed by home loans including
subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;Could/should we have cleaned up these books before and
are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs in other
books throughout the division,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, wrote in an e-
mail dated Feb. 11, 2007. 
Questioned about the e-mail at yesterday&#8217;s hearing,
Blankfein told senators that his comment didn&#8217;t represent an
opinion of the bonds. 
&#8220;When I use the expression &#8216;cats and dogs&#8217; I mean
miscellaneous stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is part of my normal
point about aged inventory. Part of the discipline of our
business is to manage risk and sell inventory.&#8221; 
Clients&#8217; Questions 
The e-mails show that as early as the fall of 2006 clients
were questioning products tied to the mortgage market. On Oct.
19, 2006, Mitchell Resnick sent an e-mail to two colleagues
asking whether the firm had material about &#8220;how great&#8221; BBB
bonds tied to home loans were. BBB is a credit rating from
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings that indicates an
asset is two levels above junk. 
&#8220;A common response I am hearing&#8221; from potential investors
is &#8220;a concern about the housing market and BBB in particular,&#8221;
Resnick wrote. &#8220;We need to arm sales with a bit more. Do we
have anything?&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar convened
a meeting of mortgage traders and risk managers on Dec. 14,
2006, according to a document prepared by the firm that the
Senate panel released yesterday. 
&#8216;Net Long&#8217; 
At the time, Goldman Sachs had a &#8220;net long exposure&#8221; to
the subprime-mortgage market, meaning the bank was betting the
market would continue to rise. At the meeting, executives agreed
that the firm should &#8220;reduce its overall exposure to the
subprime mortgage market,&#8221; the document said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Stacey Bash-Polley sent an e-mail to
colleagues six days later with the subject line &#8220;Mezz Risk,&#8221; a
reference to lower tranches of collateralized debt obligations
linked to mortgages. Investors in mezzanine tranches are among
the first to lose money when the asset starts souring. 
&#8220;We have been thinking collectively about how to help
people move some of the risk,&#8221; wrote Bash-Polley, an executive
in the Goldman Sachs division that sold bonds. &#8220;We need to make
sure we arm&#8221; salespeople &#8220;with our pricing and have them focus
on the more difficult positions.&#8221; 
Targeting Clients 
In targeting clients, Bash-Polley wrote that Goldman Sachs
should focus on those that &#8220;can possibly do larger size at a
level that would be attractive when you take into consideration
the size of risk we could move.&#8221; 
&#8220;Makes sense to me,&#8221; responded Kevin Gasvoda, a Goldman
Sachs colleague. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson declined to comment
on the e-mails. 
The Senate hearing comes less than two weeks after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm and employee
Fabrice Tourre, 31, on claims they withheld material information
from investors in a CDO. Goldman Sachs said it will vigorously
contest the case, and Tourre told the senators yesterday, &#8220;I
deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations.&#8221; 
Levin said at the hearing that Goldman Sachs &#8220;profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it didn&#8217;t want to succeed, and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
the customers it had pledged to serve.&#8221; 
Making Money 
In a Sept. 26, 2007, e-mail released by the committee, Peter
Kraus, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s then co-head of investment management,
told Blankfein that some clients were expressing concern that
the firm was making money for itself but not its customers. 
Goldman Sachs had reported six days earlier that third-
quarter net income rose 79 percent to $2.85 billion after the
bank bet against mortgage bonds. Kraus told Blankfein he had met
with more than 10 clients and &#8220;individual prospects&#8221; since the
earnings announcement. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur good at making money for urself but
not us,&#8221; wrote Kraus, who left Goldman Sachs in September 2008
after working at the company for 22 years. 
&#8220;The individuals do sometimes, but while it requires the
utmost humility from us in response, I feel very strongly it
binds clients even closer to the firm. The alternative of take
ur money to a firm who is an under performer and not the best,
just isn&#8217;t reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association
with the best is good for them in the long run,&#8221; he wrote.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Senate panel that
market-makers have no obligation to tell clients about their own
position in a security. 
Blankfein, responding to questions from Senator Carl Levin,
chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said
the nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; 
The Senate panel, winding up a probe of Goldman Sachs that
has lasted more than a year, used today&#8217;s hearing to pepper
current and former executives with questions about their duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market as
the bank also sold mortgage-linked securities to customers. 
Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees testified
about the mortgage-securities business in the years leading to
the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, was sued for fraud earlier this month by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company contests the
claim. 
Blankfein said people on Wall Street weren&#8217;t certain that
housing prices would drop before the financial crisis began. 
&#8220;I think we&#8217;re not that smart,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Even the
people who in hindsight knew it, I think they thought it, and
then it turned out they were right. I can tell you for my own
self, at 20 percent down in the housing market, I didn&#8217;t know
whether it would go down 30 percent or rebound up 10 percent.&#8221;

at least one thing during his testimony today before the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221;

Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. 
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said. 
Viniar apologized to Levin a second time after the senator
returned to the hearing room following a vote. &#8220;You were 100
percent right,&#8221; Viniar said.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, boosted
its dividend by 18 percent, almost double last year&#8217;s increase. 
The quarterly payout will rise 10 cents to 65 cents a
share, IBM said today in a statement. The Armonk, New York-based
company also is adding $8 billion to its current stock-
repurchase plan, bringing the total to $10 billion. 
The increases may boost IBM&#8217;s appeal with investors after
the company, led by Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano,
posted its smallest profit increase last year since 2005 as
clients curbed spending amid the recession. Last week, the stock
dropped after IBM reported a decline in first-quarter signings
of service contracts, suggesting corporate spending on larger
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a positive sign,&#8221; UBS AG analyst Maynard Um said of
the dividend boost, noting that investors expected it. He rates
the shares, which he doesn&#8217;t own, &#8220;neutral,&#8221; and said IBM&#8217;s
earnings growth is outpacing sales gains. 
The higher payout reflects the strength of IBM&#8217;s business
more than the economy, Vice President of Financial Management
Jesse Greene said today in an interview. IBM has spent the past
decade investing in its software and services businesses, which
tend to have higher profit margins than hardware. 
Five Acquisitions 
The increases won&#8217;t affect IBM&#8217;s acquisition strategy,
Greene added. The company bought five companies last quarter for
a total of $1 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call last week. Cash flow increased $400
million to about $1.4 billion in the period. 
Sales climbed 5.3 percent last quarter, the largest
increase in more than a year. 
IBM fell $1.91 to $128.82 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 1.6 percent
this year. 
The payout increase marks the 15th year in a row IBM has
raised its dividend, which is payable June 10 to shareholders of
record May 10. Last year was the first time since 2006 the
company didn&#8217;t boost it by 10 cents.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
were grilled by U.S. senators probing the bank&#8217;s mortgage
business as Senator Carl Levin asked why it sold a set of
investments the lender had itself labeled &#8220;shitty.&#8221; 
&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; the
Michigan Democrat asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s
mortgage unit at the time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; 
Levin, who heads the Senate subcommittee that&#8217;s holding
today&#8217;s hearings, was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from
Thomas Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the
Americas at Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a
set of mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying
to sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. 
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. 
Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees including
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein are testifying about the
mortgage-securities business in the years leading to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, had been
sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
contests the claim. 
Tourre Denies Allegations 
As the executives testified, Goldman Sachs shares had one
of three gains among the 79 financial companies in the SP 500.
The stock rose 70 cents to $152.73 as of 12:50 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs employee named by
the SEC, testified today that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied the
allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this false
claim, Tourre, 31, told the standing-room-only hearing of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. 
The transaction referred to by Levin was Timberwolf Ltd., a
$1 billion collateralized debt obligation holding pieces of
other CDOs. The CDO also included optimistic side-bets on the
performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the firm took the
opposite pessimistic side in &#8216;&#8216;many&#8217;&#8217; cases, the panel said. 
Timberwolf&#8217;s 2008 Liquidation 
&#8216;&#8216;Boy that timberwo[l]f was one shitty deal,&#8217;&#8217; Montag, who
is now Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s president of global banking and
markets, said in a June 22, 2007, e-mail. Within five months of
Timberwolf&#8217;s debut, the CDO had lost 80 percent of its value,
and it was liquidated in 2008, according to the statement
yesterday. 
&#8216;&#8216;The message that I took from the e-mail from Mr. Montag
was that my performance on that deal wasn&#8217;t good and I think the
fact that we had lost money related to that wasn&#8217;t good,&#8221;
Sparks said at the hearing. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t use that term in respect
to this deal.&#8221; 
Sparks, 43, who left the bank in 2008, told Montag earlier
on June 22, 2007, that $300 million of Timberwolf securities were
the &#8220;main thing&#8221; left among a group of positions the bank had
bought from an unidentified source, according to the e-mails. In
a June 7, 2007, e-mail, a Goldman Sachs employee said a head of
sales in Korea at the New York-based company felt like he could
&#8220;push&#8221; a buyer whose name was redacted to purchase more of the
debt. 
Blankfein to Speak 
The CDO was among securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the firm needed to reduce its mortgage
holdings, Levin&#8217;s panel said in a statement yesterday. 
Montag, now 53, isn&#8217;t scheduled to appear and didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman
Jessica Oppenheim declined to comment. 
The committee began to release excerpts of the Goldman
Sachs documents yesterday. Today, Blankfein, 55, will tell the
panel his firm didn&#8217;t wager against clients, according to a
prepared text of his remarks. 
&#8220;We believe we at all times worked appropriately with our
clients,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. We did try to manage our
risk, as our shareholders and regulators would expect.&#8217;&#8217; 
Bear Buys Timberwolf 
The Timberwolf CDO was issued in March 2007, following a
Goldman Sachs quarter that ended February 2007 in which one
department of the bank shifted from $6 billion of bets that
mortgage bonds would perform to $10 billion they would default,
according to Bloomberg data and information the panel released. 
Bear Stearns Asset Management, the manager of two hedge
funds overseen by Ralph Cioffi whose collapse in June 2007
roiled global markets, was among the buyers, purchasing about
$300 million, according to the committee. Cioffi&#8217;s funds that
month sold some securities to meet margin calls from lenders. 
Sparks in one e-mail urged &#8220;personnel working on a
potential Korean sale to &#8216;[g]et &#8216;er done,&#8217; and sent a mass e-
mail to the sales force promising &#8216;ginormous credits&#8217; for
selling&#8217;&#8217; the debt, according to Levin&#8217;s statement. &#8216;&#8216;A
congratulatory e-mail was sent to an employee who sold a number
of the securities: &#8216;Great job _ trading us out of our entire
Timberwolf Single-A position,&#8217; &#8217;&#8217; the panel said, potentially
referring to $36 million of A-rated notes. 
Montag&#8217;s Career 
Montag retired from Goldman Sachs in December 2007, and was
recruited in April 2008 by then Merrill Lynch  Co. CEO John A.
Thain to his firm. Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America
in a government-assisted deal at the start of 2009. 
CDOs repackage pools of assets such as mortgage bonds, bank
capital notes and buyout loans into new securities with varying
risks. While Timberwolf was initially intended to be about half
invested in mortgage-bond CDOs and half invested in
collateralized loan obligations tied to company debt, the bank
sold many of its &#8216;&#8216;best-performing&#8217;&#8217; CLOs separately after a
rebound in their values, Levin&#8217;s statement said. 
Levin&#8217;s committee also released e-mails with references to
Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1 and Abacus
2007-AC1, the CDO at the heart of the SEC suit filed April 16. 
The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. -- which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market -- helped the Abacus CDO
manager select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman
Sachs has called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8216;&#8216;completely unfounded.&#8221;
Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. 
Greywolf&#8217;s Role 
CDO managers select the collateral going into the vehicles,
and sometimes reinvest as the underlying positions pay down and
trade in and out of holdings. 
In Timberwolf&#8217;s case, the manager was Purchase, New York-
based Greywolf Capital Management LP. The firm&#8217;s partners
included the late Greg Mount, who joined in 2005 after nine
years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped build its CDOs business,
according to the prospectus and the firm&#8217;s website. 
Greywolf, which focuses on corporate debt and says on its
website it manages $848 million, planned to buy $41 million of
the CDO&#8217;s junior-most tranches, according to the prospectus. In
January 2007, Goldman Sachs underwrote a $502 million CLO
managed by Greywolf tied to high-yield company loans, according
to Bloomberg data. 
Conflicts Disclosed 
The conflicts of interest section of Timberwolf&#8217;s
prospectus said that Greywolf might &#8220;take into consideration
research and other brokerage services&#8221; from investment banks in
its decision-making for the CDO and also make separate
investments with &#8220;interests different from or adverse to&#8221; the
CDO&#8217;s collateral. 
&#8220;Under the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement,&#8221;
Greywolf &#8220;will be permitted to take whatever action is in the
Collateral Manager&#8217;s best interest regardless of the impact on
the Collateral Assets,&#8221; according to the prospectus. 
Mount died last April, the company said in a statement at
the time. Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Greywolf, declined to
immediately comment. 
On Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role, the prospectus said the firm would
act as the sole counterparty for the bullish derivative bets on
CDOs that the vehicle was making through so-called credit-
default swaps, &#8220;which creates concentration risk and may create
certain conflicts of interest.&#8221; 
Matthew G. Bieber, described by the panel as the Goldman
trader responsible for managing Timberwolf&#8217;s issuance, later
characterized the day that the CDO was created as &#8220;a day that
will live in infamy,&#8221; according to an e-mail released today. 
An employee at Goldman Sachs who today answered a number
for Bieber said that he was &#8220;off the desk&#8221; and didn&#8217;t take a
message.

Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, told a Senate subcommittee that
he will defend himself in court against the suit. 
&#8220;I deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations,&#8221; Tourre, 31,
said today at a standing-room-only hearing of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. &#8220;I will defend
myself in court against this false claim,&#8221; he said, adding that
a deal at the center of the suit &#8220;was not designed to fail.&#8221; 
Tourre spoke after protesters dressed in prison garb held
up signs reading &#8220;shame&#8221; and one shouted, &#8220;Too big to fail but
not too big for jail.&#8221; Six other current and former Goldman
Sachs employees including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein are testifying today about the firm&#8217;s mortgage-
securities business in the years leading up to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, contests
the SEC&#8217;s suit, saying it provided investors with all of the
information they needed. 
In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market teetered, Goldman
Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to investors ACA Management LLC and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped
pick the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle,
known as Abacus 2007-AC1, the SEC said. 
In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tourre misled ACA
into thinking that Paulson planned to invest in the equity, or
riskiest piece, of the deal instead of betting against it by
buying credit protection. 
&#8216;Most Important Clients&#8217; 
&#8220;I never told ACA, the portfolio selection agent, that
Paulson  Co. would be an equity investor in the AC-1
transaction or would take any long position in the deal,&#8221;
Tourre told the panel, as media including television crews from
Japan and Russia looked on. &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t recall the exact
words that I used, I recall informing ACA that Paulson&#8217;s fund
was expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior
tranches.&#8221; 
Tourre also told the panel that ACA and IKB were
&#8220;institutions with significant resources and experience in the
CDO market&#8221; and that they &#8220;were two of the most important
clients of my desk.&#8221; 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs also had no economic motive to design the
AC-1 transaction to fail,&#8221; said. 
&#8216;Unfounded Attacks&#8217; 
&#8220;I have been the target of unfounded attacks on my
character and motives,&#8221; Tourre said. &#8220;I appreciate the
opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to answer these
false charges.&#8221; 
The line to get into today&#8217;s hearing stretched down the
corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate office
building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the head of
the line were four protestors dressed in jail stripes holding
&#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for Tourre and Blankfein. 
&#8220;Blankfein&#8217;s not doing God&#8217;s work, he&#8217;s doing the work of
the devil,&#8221; one of the protestors said, referring to a comment
Blankfein made in November while defending the banking industry. 
Tourre was placed on paid leave by Goldman Sachs after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed its suit on April 16.
Joining him on the first panel of witnesses were Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured products group,
Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the same group,
and Daniel Sparks, a former partner who ran the mortgage
department. 
Viniar, Broderick 
Later today, the panel will hear from David Viniar, the
firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick, the chief
risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final witness at the
end of the day. 
Goldman Sachs made an estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by
placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked securities,
including some it created, Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who
leads the investigations panel, said. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t just make money, it profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it did not want to succeed and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
its customers,&#8221; Levin said today in his opening remarks. &#8220;Its
conduct brings into question the whole conduct of Wall Street.&#8221; 
Blankfein, in his prepared remarks, said the firm &#8220;didn&#8217;t
have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly
did not bet against our clients.&#8221; 
Paulson&#8217;s Position 
Tourre &#8220;believes that he indicated&#8221; to investors that
Paulson was interested in taking a &#8220;short&#8221; position on the
deal, meaning he was betting against it, Greg Palm, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said last week. 
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican Senator from Maine, said
in her opening Statement that &#8220;even legal practices can raise
ethical concerns.&#8221; 
&#8220;There is something unseemly about Goldman betting against
the housing market at the same time as it is selling to its
clients mortgage backed securities containing toxic loans,&#8221;
Collins said. 
&#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime now,&#8221;
Tourre wrote to a friend in a January 2007 e-mail, according to
the SEC complaint. &#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous
Fab... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly
leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily
understanding all of the implications of those
monstruosities!!!&#8221; 
&#8216;Not Too Brilliant&#8217; 
In a March 7, 2007, e-mail released by the firm, Tourre
described the U.S. subprime mortgage market as &#8220;not too
brilliant&#8221; and said that &#8220;according to Sparks,&#8221; an apparent
reference to Daniel Sparks who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage
business at the time, &#8220;that business is totally dead, and the
poor little subprime borrowers will not last too long!!!&#8221; 
John McCain, the Republican Senator from Arizona, said he
didn&#8217;t know if anything Goldman Sachs did was illegal. 
&#8220;But from the reading of these e-mails and the information
that this committee has uncovered there&#8217;s no doubt that their
behavior was unethical,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;The American people will
render a judgment as well as the courts.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, has the worst-performing actively traded corporate
bonds from a benchmark offering this year. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due 2020 have fallen
3.9 cents on the dollar since being issued on March 1 to 95.9
cents as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt yields 2.17 percentage points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries. 
The debt has declined 5.18 cents since April 15, the day
before the SEC said New York-based Goldman Sachs created and
sold securities linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying loans and bet against
the vehicles. 
Goldman Sachs executives, including Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, are scheduled to appear today
before a Senate subcommittee. The SEC&#8217;s allegations &#8220;are
completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs said April 16 in a statement. 
Financial company bonds yielded 1.93 percentage points more
than benchmarks as of yesterday, an increase of 0.07 percentage
point from April 15, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Financial Corporate Index.

Morgan Stanley plans to open an
investment unit in Poland, following some of the world&#8217;s biggest
banks seeking to land fees from planned government asset sales. 
The New York-based company will join Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG in vying for advisory work in a
market &#8220;that&#8217;s becoming a leading financial hub in central and
eastern Europe,&#8221; Franck Petitgas, the head of investment
banking at Morgan Stanley, said in a statement today. 
The Polish government this year plans to sell stakes in its
energy, insurance, chemical and phone companies to raise $10
billion to finance the widening budget deficit. Potential
advisory work on those sales is helping draw in foreign banks,
while the economy is the only one in the European Union that has
avoided a recession. 
Marcin Socha, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s executive director in
Poland, will head the Warsaw office. The bank also plans to
become a member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange to give its
customers direct access to stocks traded in the Polish capital,
it said. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is also seeking to open a
branch office in Warsaw, spokeswoman Monika Schaller said on
March 25. Credit Suisse announced in January a plan to open a
brokerage this year after shuttering its Warsaw stock-dealing
business in 2003.

Global demand for dry bulk
commodities will expand 6 percent this year, compared with a
previous forecast of 3.7 percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. 
The bank now expects iron-ore trade growth of 11.2 percent,
from an earlier estimate of 5.7 percent, and coal demand
expansion of 5.7 percent, from 3.8 percent, analysts Jonathan
Chappell and Darren Hicks in New York wrote in a note today. 
The increased trade will coincide with half the ships that
are scheduled to be built this year being delayed or cancelled,
as yards in Asia fail to deliver a record order book on time,
they said. 
&#8220;We do not believe that it is even physically possible for
the shipyards to meet this robust schedule, with or without
financing concerns,&#8221; they added. 
JPMorgan increased its forecasts for what ships will earn
as a result by as much as 33 percent. 
So-called panamax ships, the largest to sail through the
Panama Canal, will average $21,200 a day this year, up from a
previous forecast of $16,000, JPMorgan said. Rates for
capesizes, most commonly used to haul iron ore, were revised up

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, will face off against a U.S.
Senate subcommittee today in a pivotal hearing that could have
repercussions for the future of the financial industry. 
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released documents
that he said showed the company &#8220;put its own interest and
profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221; a conflict he
called on Congress to end. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, will dispute that
assertion and argue the firm was merely managing its own risk. 
The hearing takes place as the Senate debates financial
reform legislation that could prevent banks from trading for
their own accounts and require them to separate derivatives
businesses from regulated depository subsidiaries. It also
follows a U.S. regulator&#8217;s civil-fraud lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre, for misleading investors
in a mortgage-linked investment, charges the firm denies. 
&#8220;This market is not free until it is free of self-dealing
and until it is free of conflict of interest,&#8221; Levin, 75, said
at a press briefing yesterday. &#8220;It is not free until it ends
the gambling operation that results in gambling debts that the
public ends up paying.&#8221; 
Tourre, Blankfein 
The hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. in Washington, will
start with questioning of Tourre; Michael Swenson, a managing
director in the structured-products group; Joshua Birnbaum, a
former managing director in the same group; and Daniel Sparks, a
former partner who ran the mortgage department. 
Later in the day, the subcommittee will hear from David
Viniar, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick,
the chief risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final
witness, facing the panel alone at the end of the hearing. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will tell the committee, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. 
While the firm contests the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do a
better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
Shares Fall 
Goldman Sachs fell 0.4 percent to $151.43 by 12:23 p.m. in
Germany, after dropping 3.4 percent to $152.03 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, before Levin&#8217;s statements
were made public. The shares have tumbled 17 percent from their
level before the SEC filed its suit and are down 10 percent so
far this year in New York. 
Yesterday U.S. Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from
advancing their plan to overhaul Wall Street regulation as the
two sides debate provisions including consumer protections and
derivatives. Both parties are trying to tap into voter anger at
Wall Street and the bank bailouts that took place as Americans
grappled with record home foreclosures and rising unemployment. 
Goldman Sachs would probably be hardest hit among large
U.S. banks if Congress bans firms from trading for their own
account. Viniar, the CFO who&#8217;s scheduled to testify today,
estimated in January that approximately 10 percent of the
company&#8217;s revenue derives from trading that has no connection
with customer business. That would have been about $4.5 billion
last year. 
Employees of Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay
record in 2007 when Blankfein was awarded a $67.9 million bonus,
are among the biggest political donors in the last two decades. 
Campaign Contributions 
Nine of the 10 members of Levin&#8217;s committee have accepted
campaign finance donations from the firm&#8217;s employees, both
individually and through a political action committee, since
1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based research group. The exception is Senator Edward
Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware, who never raised money for an
election because he was appointed to fill Vice President Joseph
Biden&#8217;s former seat and hasn&#8217;t run for a full term. 
Arizona Republican John McCain, who ran for president in
2000 and 2008, has accepted the most of any member of the
subcommittee with $337,065, while Jon Tester, a Democrat from
Montana, has taken just $6,400, the group&#8217;s data show. 
While the spotlight is on Goldman Sachs at today&#8217;s hearing,
Levin emphasized that the firm&#8217;s actions represent practices
that he said are widespread on Wall Street. 
&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;We think there
are a number of banks engaged in similar conduct, but we had to
focus on one.&#8221; 
&#8216;Heavy Bets&#8217; 
Levin, whose committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs in June, estimates that the firm made $3.7 billion
in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked
securities, including some it created. The figure doesn&#8217;t take
into account losses Goldman Sachs suffered on mortgage-related
securities it held, he said. 
&#8220;We respectfully disagree with Chairman Levin&#8217;s
statement,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
said yesterday. &#8220;We did not have a big bet against the housing
market, as our performance in residential mortgages
demonstrates, and we believe we at all times worked
appropriately with our clients.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs released data on April 24 that showed the
firm reaped gains on its mortgage trading activities in 2007 and
then lost money in the same unit in 2008. 
&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; 
Among the evidence Levin released yesterday was an internal
e-mail that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk
started the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB-
rated mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; 
An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Sparks, who ran the
mortgage business and is among those testifying today, includes
the comment &#8220;real bad feeling across European sales about some
of the trades we did with clients. The damage this has done to
our franchise is very significant. Aggregate loss of our clients
on just these 5 trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; 
Swenson, the managing director in the structured-products
group who is also to appear today, boasted in his 2007
performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to clients who demanded
that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program as clients tried to
gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring to the name for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those were
unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of millions
of dollars.&#8221; 
Conveyor Belt 
In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from those of institutional clients. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
Conflicts of Interest 
Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether any crimes occurred, although he said the panel will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the SEC
or the Justice Department. 
&#8220;The SEC and the courts will resolve the legal question of
whether Goldman&#8217;s actions broke the law,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The
question for us is whether Goldman&#8217;s actions in 2007 were
appropriate and whether we should act, legislatively, to bar
similar actions in the future.&#8221; 
While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package in the Senate this week, he said he thinks it
could be strengthened. He has proposed an amendment that would
help resolve the conflicts of interest among Wall Street firms
that he said are embodied in the documents. He also endorsed
banning so-called naked credit-default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the underlying loans or bonds. 
&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; 
After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
Web site on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. 
Goldman Sachs disputes the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a collateralized debt
obligation tied to mortgages by failing to inform them of the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. The company said on
April 24 that Levin&#8217;s committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence
it released and jumped to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a
hearing.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then topped
that in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. 
&#8216;Ultimate Harm&#8217; 
While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. 
&#8220;The ultimate harm here is not just to the clients who
were not well-served by their investment bank, the harm here is
to all of us,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman
Sachs and others helped inject into our financial system have
done incalculable harm to people who have never heard of a
synthetic CDO and who have no defenses against the harm that
such exotic Wall Street creations can cause.&#8221;

Chevron Corp. and its partners in
the Gorgon liquefied natural gas venture off northwest Australia
have awarded about A$20 billion ($19 billion) in contracts, with
Australian companies winning more than a third of the work. 
A Leighton Holdings Ltd. unit is among Australian
contractors that have gained more than A$7 billion in combined
Gorgon orders, Chevron Australia said in its Frontier magazine.
The company plans to add 700 workers in Australia by the end of
this year as the country&#8217;s importance to Chevron&#8217;s global
operations grows. 
Australian gas developments have become the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221;
of Chevron&#8217;s growth strategy as the second-largest U.S. energy
producer advances the A$43 billion Gorgon venture, Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in the publication. 
Chevron expects to employ more than 2,500 people in
Australia by the end of 2010, compared with 1,800 now, the
company said. Gorgon, due to start LNG exports in 2014, has
already generated almost 3,000 jobs, the company estimated. 
The construction of Gorgon on the Barrow Island nature
reserve is proceeding after San Ramon, California-based Chevron,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc approved the project
last year. Unions and contractors reached an agreement on
working conditions in January, Chevron said. 
The venture, Australia&#8217;s largest resources investment, will
spend A$20 billion on Australian &#8220;goods and services&#8221; over the
next five years, Chevron said. The U.S. oil and gas producer&#8217;s
Wheatstone venture, also in Western Australia, is among more
than a dozen proposed LNG projects in Australia targeting rising
Asian demand for cleaner-burning fuels.

An environmental report for Chevron
Corp.&#8217;s plan to upgrade an oil refinery near San Francisco
failed to adequately specify whether heavier and more polluting
crude oil could be processed or disclose measures for mitigating
increases in greenhouse gas emissions, a California court ruled. 
A state appeals court in San Francisco yesterday found that
elements of the report violated requirements of California&#8217;s
environmental quality law. The Richmond City Council relied on
the report when it voted 5-4 in 2008 to issue permits for the
Chevron project in that city, according to the ruling. 
The project, which would replace equipment including a
40-year-old hydrogen unit, was halted after a state court judge
ruled that an environmental permit was inadequate. Groups
including Earthjustice and Communities for a Better Environment
alleged in a lawsuit that the project would increase pollution. 
Chevron is reviewing the ruling, said spokesman Brent
Tippen, in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We feel both the evidence and the law amply supported the
adequacy of the environmental impact report prepared by the city
of Richmond for the renewal project,&#8221; Tippen said in the
statement. &#8220;Chevron believes that the renewal project was
properly analyzed and permitted.&#8221; 
Chevron and environmental groups halted talks on reviving
the project, Chevron said in July. 
The case is Communities for a Better Environment v. City of
Richmond, A125618, Court of Appeal (San Francisco).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which for
years saw no need to play a traditional Washington lobbying
game, is deploying former lawmakers and crisis specialists as it
tries to tamp down the political firestorm threatening its well-
honed brand. 
The firm&#8217;s 12-person government affairs office in
Washington is aiding what one person involved called a franchise
protection strategy in the wake of a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud suit against the firm this month. Advisers
include an ex-House Democratic Leader, a chief of staff to
President Ronald Reagan, President Bill Clinton&#8217;s SEC chairman
and President Barack Obama&#8217;s first White House counsel. 
The first test of the campaign comes today as Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six other current or
former Goldman Sachs employees testify before a Senate panel
investigating the company&#8217;s role in fueling the subprime loan
crisis. The grilling is a turnabout for the firm, which has seen
its former partners become Treasury secretaries, top
presidential aides and even senators. 
&#8220;Goldman relied on their top-level connections so they
wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the public relations and the crisis
lobbying,&#8221; said Mark Corallo, a former Justice Department
spokesman who now provides communications advice to companies.
&#8220;Seemingly they haven&#8217;t learned the lesson of politics: In a
crisis, it&#8217;s every man for himself.&#8221;

Levin, who questioned Goldman Sachs executives during a

JPMorgan Chase  Co. will stop
financing tax-refund loans for about 13,000 independent U.S.
preparers, according to a person at the bank briefed on the
matter, a move that may drive customers toward HR Block Inc. 
The bank decided tax-refund loans don&#8217;t fit the New York-
based company&#8217;s strategic plans, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced.
American Banker, the industry trade journal, reported the halt
earlier today. 
&#8220;Block is the biggest winner in this,&#8221; said John Hewitt,
chief executive officer of Liberty Tax Service, a privately held
company in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that also may benefit. 
Refund-anticipation loans, or RALs, are used to attract
clients who need cash immediately by offering short-term loans
based on the expected amount of their tax refunds. Consumer
groups fault RALs for putting people deeper in debt, with interest rates on some versions that exceed 100 percent on an
annualized basis. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender after Bank of
America Corp., joins banks that have stopped offering refund-
anticipation loans or plan to do so, including London-based HSBC
Holdings Plc and Santa Barbara Bank  Trust. The decision may
give Kansas City, Missouri-based HR Block an advantage through
2013, when its contract with HSBC expires.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Dan Toscano as co-head of global
leveraged and acquisition finance as lending to non-investment
grade companies rebounds. 
Toscano, 45, will join the New York-based firm May 3 and
will lead the group with Gene Martin, according to an internal
memo from Raj Dhanda, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of global capital
markets. A copy of the memo was obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney. 
Toscano was co-head of leveraged and acquisition finance in
the Americas at HSBC Holdings Plc, which he left last year. He
also worked in leveraged finance at Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers
Trust Co. for almost 16 years, according to the memo. 
Leveraged lending has rebounded this year after the amount
of high-yield loans dropped in 2009 to the lowest level since
2001. Companies borrowed $66.8 billion in the U.S. syndicated
leveraged loan market in the first quarter, more than five times
that of a year earlier, according to Bloomberg data. High-yield,
or leveraged, loans are those rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service or BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. led
lenders to CF Industries Holdings Inc. to finance the $4.7
billion takeover of Terra Industries Inc., which was completed
this month. 
Toscano is at least the fourth senior hire for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s capital markets unit in the last six months. The firm
hired John Moore from 3i Capital to serve as co-head of equity
capital markets for the Americas earlier this month, according
to an April 12 memo. 
Last month, the unit hired Wylie Collins a vice chairman
for global capital markets. He was previously head of Americas
debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch  Co. Morgan Stanley hired
David Moffitt, also a former Merrill Lynch executive, in
November as head of global credit solutions. 
Whit Marshall will serve as head of leveraged and
acquisition finance for the Americas, and Matt Naber and Mark
Walsh will continue to lead the unit in Europe, the memo said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Petroleo
Brasileiro SA and other oil producers offered Argentine workers
an 18 percent raise in a bid to avert a nationwide strike that
could lead to fuel shortages, an industry group said. 
The Oil Industry Chamber, which also represents Royal Dutch
Shell Plc in salary negotiations with unions, will discuss the
offer in government-brokered talks with union officials
tomorrow, Executive Director Enrique Pourteau said in a
telephone interview today. The Argentine Federation of Oil, Gas
and Biofuel Workers called a strike for April 30. 
Petrobras, Exxon, Shell, Destileria Argentina de Petroleo
SA and Rutilex Hidrocarburos Argentinos SA refine about 50
percent of the country&#8217;s fuel in the seven cities where the
federation plans the stoppage. A fuel shortage in Argentina
would come at a time when neighboring Chile is boosting imports
from Asia to cover domestic demand after a Feb. 27 earthquake
devastated the country&#8217;s biggest refinery. 
The union hasn&#8217;t named the units that will be affected by
the Argentine strike. Eight refineries in the seven cities have
a combined capacity to process 330,800 barrels of oil a day, or
about 50 percent of Argentina&#8217;s total refining capacity,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Repsol YPF SA&#8217;s Argentine unit said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg News that its three refineries in the country won&#8217;t be
affected by a strike because its workers belong to a different
union. The units have a combined capacity to process 320,000
barrels per day.

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.,
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke beverages, has
surpassed National Bank of Greece SA to become the nation&#8217;s
biggest company by market value after the Greek debt crisis
caused banking stocks to plunge. 
Coca-Cola Hellenic, which is 24 percent owned by the Coca-
Cola Co., has a value of more than 7 billion euros ($9.3
billion), the only such company on the Athens exchange, after
National Bank plunged more than 41 percent this year on concern
over the country&#8217;s debt. Shares in the bottler gained 0.5
percent to 19.80 euros today, for a value of 7.2 billion euros. 
National Bank, the country&#8217;s oldest and biggest bank,
rebounded today for the first time since April 15 after the
country&#8217;s securities regulator banned short selling on the
bourse for two months. The lender gained 8.5 percent to 10.85
euros, valuing the business at 6.5 billion euros. 
Athens-based CCHBC bottles Coca-Cola drinks, teas, water
and juices in 27 European countries, including Russia, and
Nigeria, and its geographical expansion has helped buffer the
company from the effects of the Greek economic crisis. The
company may tomorrow say first-quarter profit jumped to 13.9
million euros ($18.5 million) from 1.9 million euros a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
endured more than 10 hours of congressional grilling in one of
the most public, and most hostile, political lashings in the
firm&#8217;s 141-year history. By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s
market value had risen by $549 million. 
Senator Carl Levin and members of his Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations said evidence they presented made
the case for Congress to pass legislation tightening financial
regulation. Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm, was alone among 79 stocks of the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index in posting a gain yesterday. 
&#8220;Both sides got what they wanted,&#8221; said Robert Hillman, a
securities law professor at the University of California, Davis.
&#8220;The Senate probably did what it felt it had to do, which was
bring Goldman people up and embarrass them. For Goldman, the
goal was to demonstrate that they had not engaged in fraud or
illegal conduct. They probably succeeded in that.&#8221; 
The senators, capping a probe of Goldman Sachs that has
lasted more than a year, peppered Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former executives with questions
about their duty to clients and the ethics of betting against
the housing market as the bank sold mortgage-linked securities
to customers. The hearing came 12 days after the Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the New York-based firm for fraud,
saying the bank misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment
known as Abacus, claims the company denies. 
&#8216;Jarring&#8217; Realities 
&#8220;The cultural realities of what you all do is jarring to
most Americans,&#8221; Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from
Missouri and former prosecutor, told Blankfein during the
hearing. &#8220;This notion of selling a product that you&#8217;re betting
against is hard for people to understand.&#8221; 
Blankfein, who repeatedly insisted the company had done
nothing wrong, said after the hearing that he had &#8220;no
illusions&#8221; about how hard Wall Street must work to win back the
trust of the American people. 
&#8220;Wall Street has a lot of work to do to regain the
confidence of Main Street,&#8221; Blankfein told Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;We have a lot to improve in our communication with
Main Street and we&#8217;re committed to do it.&#8221; 
In a voicemail to employees last night, Blankfein called
the questioning &#8220;rigorous,&#8221; and said he tried to convey the
&#8220;seriousness with which we adhere to the rules and regulations
that govern our business.&#8221; 
&#8216;Continued External Focus&#8217; 
&#8220;Let me remind you that we should anticipate continued
external focus on Goldman Sachs for the foreseeable future,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the message. &#8220;Please do not let this distract
you from your daily responsibilities.&#8221; 
Some senators used the hearing to advertise their position
on a financial regulatory bill that&#8217;s been blocked by
Republicans so far this week. Levin concluded the hearing by
calling for tougher regulation than the bill contains, while
Republicans including Tom Coburn said they felt the measure
fails to address issues such as how to handle companies that are
&#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; 
As the day began, a line to enter the hearing stretched
down the corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate
office building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the
head of the queue were four protesters dressed in black-and-
white convict stripes and holding &#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for
Blankfein and Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Frenchman who was
the only Goldman Sachs employee named in the SEC suit.
Television crews from Russia and Japan were among journalists
who filled the packed room. 
&#8216;Huge Shorts&#8217; 
Disagreements between the senators and the executives
started with how much money the bank earned. Levin said Goldman
Sachs made $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;huge shorts&#8221;
against mortgage-linked securities. Taking into account losses
on securities it held, the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
securities had net revenue of less than $500 million, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said. 
&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; Levin
asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s mortgage unit at the
time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; 
Levin was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from Thomas
Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the Americas at
Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a set of
mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying to
sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; 
&#8216;I Don&#8217;t Recall&#8217; 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. 
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. 
Blankfein, responding to questions from Levin, said the
nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers and market-makers have no obligation
to tell clients about their own position in a security. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; 
Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told Blankfein he&#8217;s
&#8220;troubled&#8221; by his view that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to
understand conflicts of interest. 
&#8216;Troubles Me&#8217; 
&#8220;You can make sure that someone you sell an investment to
knows that you believe it&#8217;s a bad investment,&#8221; Levin said.
&#8220;You obviously don&#8217;t see that. It troubles me that you don&#8217;t
see that.&#8221; 
Levin added, &#8220;It troubles me that you don&#8217;t see that your
client is yourself. Goldman Sachs has turned itself into its own
client.&#8221; 
The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market, helped the Abacus CDO manager
select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman Sachs has
called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; Paulson
wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. 
Tourre, wearing a charcoal-gray suit, white shirt and red-
and-navy striped tie, testified that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied
the allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this
false claim,&#8221; Tourre told the standing-room-only hearing. 
Conveying Risks 
&#8220;The securities weren&#8217;t meant to fail; they succeeded by
conveying the risks that people wanted,&#8221; Blankfein told Senator
Jon Tester about the Abacus deal. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re speaking a different language
here,&#8221; replied Tester, a Democrat from Montana who was a farmer
before he entered politics. Tester said &#8220;it seemed to me more
than just a little bit odd&#8221; that Paulson helped pick securities
even as he was betting against a CDO that later collapsed in
value. 
The politicians expressed frustration over a lack of direct
answers during the first panel, which lasted more than five
hours and featured testimony from Tourre; Sparks; Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured-products group;
and Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the group. 
Levin and Viniar, the chief financial officer, agreed on at
least one thing during his testimony: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221; 
&#8216;Very Unfortunate&#8217; 
&#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate to have on e-mail,&#8221;
Viniar said, drawing laughter from the audience and the press,
after Levin asked how he felt when he read e-mails in which
Goldman Sachs employees described mortgage-linked securities as
&#8220;crap&#8221; or &#8220;shitty.&#8221; 
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t take that the wrong way,&#8221; Viniar said when
pressed by Levin. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate for anyone
to have said that in any form.&#8221; 
Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. 
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest company, posted a smaller gain in first-quarter profit
than analysts estimated as health-care legislation increased
costs and U.S. refineries operated at a loss. 
Net income rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a
share, from $4.55 billion, or 92 cents, a year earlier, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon said today in a statement. Per-share profit
was 8 cents below the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. 
Exxon recorded a $200 million charge to reflect an increase
in health-care costs driven by legislation that President Barack
Obama signed into law last month. The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries
lost more than $600,000 a day as gains in gasoline and diesel
prices failed to keep pace with crude-oil costs. 
&#8220;The costs of health-care legislation are a hit every
company is going to take in one shape or another,&#8221; said Gianna
Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research in Flossmoor,
Illinois. &#8220;In refining, they&#8217;re taking it on the chin because
crude is so expensive and demand for fuel is lackluster.&#8221; 
Exxon fell 53 cents to $68.66 as of the 4 p.m. close of New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has 10 buy
ratings from analysts, 10 holds and 1 sell. 
The profit increase was Exxon&#8217;s first since the 2008 third
quarter. The company benefited from a jump in oil prices and its
biggest gain in first-quarter crude and natural-gas production
since 2000. Revenue climbed 41 percent to $90.3 billion. 
Cash Stockpile Grows 
The company spent $2 billion on share buybacks during the
first three months of the year and intends to maintain that pace
of purchases during the current quarter, according to the
statement. Exxon&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents rose by $3 billion
during the January-to-March period, to $13.7 billion. 
Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 66 percent to $5.81
billion. Exxon was paid an average of $74.21 per barrel of crude
sold outside the U.S., a 77 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to data on the company&#8217;s Web site. 
Exxon increased production 4.5 percent to the equivalent of
4.36 million barrels of crude a day, led by higher gas output in
the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Gas from Exxon&#8217;s
U.S. wells sold for $5.32 per thousand cubic feet, a 15 percent
increase. 
Global oil demand increased enough to fill 83 supertankers
after economies around the world emerged from recession,
according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Refining Margins Narrow 
Exxon&#8217;s worldwide refining profit tumbled 97 percent to $37
million as margins from processing crude into fuels such as
gasoline and jet fuel in the U.S. evaporated. Chemicals earnings
more than tripled to $1.25 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans $28 billion in
capital spending this year to boost production with new wells
from California to the Middle East and to upgrade refineries.
Exxon also agreed in December to buy XTO Energy Inc., the
largest U.S. gas producer, for more than $29 billion. 
Exxon plans to close the purchase of Fort Worth, Texas-
based XTO by the end of June. The acquisition, Exxon&#8217;s largest
since it bought the former Mobil Corp. in 1999, will give the
company access to XTO&#8217;s gas reserves and its expertise in
tapping rock formations impervious to conventional drilling
techniques. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company,
yesterday said its net income climbed 57 percent to $5.48
billion. BP Plc of London said April 27 that its first-quarter
profit more than doubled to $6.08 billion. 
Earnings also more than doubled at ConocoPhillips and
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the third- and fourth-largest U.S.
oil companies by market value, which released their reports
today. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, is
scheduled to report earnings tomorrow.

Options traders are boosting bets
that shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most-profitable
Wall Street firm, will rebound from losses spurred by the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. 
Investors used a butterfly strategy yesterday, spending an
average of $1.56 per trade on contracts expiring in June,
according to a report from Interactive Brokers Group Inc. The
maximum profit of $8.44 per spread is earned should Goldman
Sachs close at $175 on June 18, the brokerage said. The shares
have sunk to $160.24 from $184.27 on April 15, the day before
the SEC announced its lawsuit. 
&#8220;The transaction is a very efficient way to act on bullish
sentiment because maximum loss potential -- $1.56 per contract
in this case -- is scant when compared to potential profits
which are 5.4 times greater,&#8221; Caitlin Duffy of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers wrote in a note yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs fell the most since January 2009 on April 16
after the SEC said the bank misled investors in a mortgage-
linked investment. On April 27, executives endured more than 10
hours of congressional grilling in one of the most public, and
most hostile, political lashings in the firm&#8217;s 141-year history.
By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s market value had risen by
$549 million, and it posted the only gain among 79 financial
institutions in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
June Contracts 
To create the butterfly yesterday, investors bought about
8,000 June $165 calls and 8,000 June $185 calls, while selling
16,000 June $175 calls. More than 108,000 Goldman Sachs calls
traded yesterday, 30 percent above than the four-week average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Interactive Brokers said that traders also used a bullish
butterfly strategy on Goldman Sachs on April 26 and April 27. 
A butterfly spread strategy combines three options with the
same expiration date and different strike prices, with half of
the contracts bought or sold at the middle strike price and the
rest divided among the top and bottom. 
Today, an investor made a bullish bet by selling almost
10,000 calls at the May $170 strike while buying June $165 calls
and selling June $175 calls, Duffy said. 
Goldman Sachs shares rose 2.1 percent today, rallying for
the third straight day.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are among U.S. investment banks that may be
forced to raise an additional $250 billion in capital, cut
executive pay and divest some of their most lucrative assets
under a bill on the U.S. Senate floor today, analysts say. 
A two-page provision tucked inside the 1,558-page bill on
April 21 would change the structure of about 40 of the largest
U.S. investment banks by forcing them to spin off their
derivatives businesses. Another measure added this month would
require derivatives dealers to maintain a &#8220;fiduciary duty&#8221; to
municipal, pension and retirement plan investors, which some
analysts say would wipe out that market altogether. 
&#8220;The bill has moved so far left so hard, that it&#8217;s caught
everybody by surprise,&#8221; said FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia. He said the bill was a &#8220;big, big hot button issue
with voters.&#8221; &#8220;The Street now is just realizing that all of
this stuff is getting in the bill.&#8221; 
The spin-off provision would result in a capital deficit of
$85 billion at eight of the largest global investment banks,
analysts led by Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan Securities in
London estimated in a research note today. It prohibits swaps
dealers from taking any federal assistance, including access to
the Federal Reserve discount window or deposit insurance from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Spinning out Derivatives 
At a minimum, the measure would require banks to spin out
their derivatives business into a separately capitalized
affiliate, analysts say. It was actually designed to force about
40 of the largest U.S. swaps dealers that also have federally
insured banks to divest all swaps activities, said Courtney
Rowe, a spokeswoman for bill sponsor Senator Blanche Lincoln,
who sponsored the bill. 
&#8220;This would be a sweeping change to our financial system
and it was introduced 11 days ago without a hearing, without a
study on its impact,&#8221; said Luke Zubrod of Pennsylvania-based
Chatham Financial Corp., which advises more than 1,000 firms on
derivatives. 
If passed, analysts say the provision would drive business
to foreign broker dealers that don&#8217;t take deposits in the U.S.,
such as Societe Generale, France&#8217;s No. 2 bank by market value.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which
represents Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and other large
derivatives dealers, estimates the provision would require as
much as $250 billion in new capital. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that the proposed regulatory
changes would have a significant impact on global return on
equities, declining from 19 percent pre-regulation to 12
percent,&#8221; Abouhossein wrote. &#8220;Given the political pressure in
various geographies, we believe investment bank compensation
reduction would be a key driver&#8221; to boost profitability. 
&#8216;Banks Should Be Banks&#8217; 
Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, said she may not have the
votes to pass the measure, and several other amendments are
pending in the Senate that would potentially separate certain
investment-banking activities from the traditional business of
taking deposits and lending money. 
&#8220;Banks should be banks,&#8221; Rowe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from
Arkansans, especially our community banks in Arkansas, that they
need a level playing field.&#8221; 
Analysts say they fear that anger over Wall Street may
drive support for more burdensome amendments, like reinstating
Glass-Steagall-like regulations that separated investment and
commercial banking. 
&#8220;There really is a new kind of political model at work
here,&#8221; said Brian Gardner, an analyst for KBW Inc. in
Washington and a former staff director for Louisiana
Representative Richard Baker, who was chair of the House
Financial Services committee sub-committee before he left
Congress in 2008. &#8220;The dissatisfaction with Wall Street and
then the Goldman news has just changed the political dynamic.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has a larger exposure than any of
its peers to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain,
according to Wells Fargo  Co. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure to the five so-called PIIGS countries
is $36.3 billion, equating to 28 percent of the firm&#8217;s Tier-1
capital, a measure of financial strength, Wells Fargo analysts
including Matthew Burnell wrote today. Morgan Stanley holds
$32.4 billion of debt in the region, which equates to 69 percent
of its Tier 1 capital, Burnell wrote. 
&#8220;Regulatory data suggests JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure is largest
in aggregate, but Morgan Stanley held the largest aggregate
exposure to the PIIGS relative to Tier 1 capital,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. Overall U.S. bank &#8220;exposure to Greece is lower than
exposure to Ireland, Italy and Spain.&#8221; 
Bonds and stocks plunged across Europe in the past week on
concern the Greek debt crisis is spreading across the euro area.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s this week cut Greece, Portugal and Spain&#8217;s
credit ratings as concern the nations may fail to meet their
debt commitments increased. 
U.S. banks held a total of $236.8 billion of exposure to
the five nations, including $18.1 billion to Greece, Wells Fargo
said. European banks have claims totaling $193.1 billion on
Greece, according to the Bank for International Settlements,
with another $832.2 billion of claims on Spain.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. met
regulators from the U.K. Financial Services Authority today to
formally discuss how the agency&#8217;s probe into the bank will
progress, two people familiar with the investigation said. 
It was the first time Goldman Sachs and the agency met to
discuss the timetable of the probe, the people said, on
condition of anonymity because the inquiry is confidential. The
regulator has a duty to meet with firms it is investigating at
an early stage to outline what will happen during the probe. 
The FSA said earlier this month that it was investigating
Goldman Sachs&#8217; London office after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over the New York-based
bank&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. Prime
Minister Gordon Brown, facing a May 6 election, called on the
FSA to investigate after the SEC suit. 
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and FSA spokesman
Chris Hamilton both declined to comment. Sky News first reported
the meeting today. 
The bank may be fined or individuals banned if the FSA
finds a breach of its rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president
named in the SEC case, Fabrice Tourre, is employed at the bank&#8217;s
London office. His FSA authorization was suspended at the firm&#8217;s
request. 
Senate Questioning 
Goldman Sachs executives, including Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, were questioned by a U.S. Senate Subcommittee
earlier this week over the bank&#8217;s marketing of CDOs, which the
SEC alleges was fraudulent. Goldman Sachs denies the allegations
and has said it will fight the suit. 
Tourre was also questioned at the Senate hearing. He
started working at the London office in November 2008, according
to the FSA&#8217;s register, and the SEC&#8217;s allegations relate to when
he worked in New York. 
The French markets regulator, the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said today it found no evidence that local fund-
management companies bought the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-AC1,
which is the subject of the SEC lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s BaFin
regulator said this month it will seek information from the SEC
about the case. 
German and British banks both lost money because of the
fraud, according to the SEC suit. The Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, majority-owned by U.K. taxpayers, unwound a position
in Abacus bought by its ABN Amro unit by paying Goldman Sachs
$840.9 million, the SEC said. Germany&#8217;s IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG lost nearly all of its $150 million investment
in the CDO, according to the SEC. 
CDOs bundle bonds or loans, or both, from a variety of
issuers, such as companies or countries. Interest payments on
the underlying bonds or loans are used to pay investors.

Incentives to buy electric cars
such as Nissan Motor Co.&#8217;s Leaf will &#8220;plunder&#8221; government
treasuries and do little to reverse pollution, a coalition of
German environmental groups said today. 
&#8220;A lot of money is going to be handed out to support
electric cars instead of implementing tougher carbon-dioxide
emissions and making gas and diesel cars more efficient,&#8221; said
Juergen Resch, who heads the Berlin-based environmental
organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe. 
Carmakers including Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG should
focus on boosting fuel efficiency and lowering carbon emissions
for vehicles installed with combustion motors, Resch said.
Electric cars often pollute more than gasoline or diesel
vehicles factoring in emissions at coal and natural gas power
plants, he said. 
Powering an electric car using the existing combination of
electricity sources in Germany, including coal and natural gas,
means such vehicles emit at least 120 grams of CO2 for each
kilometer driven, the environmental groups said. That&#8217;s more
than Volkswagen&#8217;s least-polluting Polo at 99 grams and Daimler&#8217;s
Smart car, which has a carbon output of 87 grams. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel is to meet May 3 with
representatives from the automobile and energy industries in
Berlin to discuss the future of electric mobility.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s legal
troubles may be contained to the U.S. as investors in Europe bet
regulation will lead to more stability for banks, said Gary
Jenkins, head of credit strategy at Evolution Securities Ltd. 
Bonds of U.K. banks have returned 0.28 percent since
Goldman was accused of defrauding investors 11 days ago,
compared with losses of 0.75 percent in the U.S., according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate
Index. Securities of New York-based Goldman gave up 3.45 percent
in the same period, making them the worst performers among the
biggest firms in the benchmark. 
&#8220;More intense regulation isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing,&#8221;
Jenkins said. &#8220;Bondholders are concerned about the ability of
banks to repay debt. The more stable financial firms are and the
more focus there is on a steady return over a business cycle,
the better for bondholders.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, became on April 16 the first major bank accused by the
Securities and Exchange Commission of fraud connected to the
collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Investors in the U.S.
have &#8220;woken up&#8221; to the Obama Administration&#8217;s determination to
target investment banks, while regulators in Europe have been
more passive, Jenkins said. 
&#8220;The Goldman Sachs SEC investigation is having much more
of an impact in the U.S. than in Europe,&#8221; he said. 
&#8216;Significant Upside&#8217; 
Investors in Europe are favoring bonds of Barclays Plc,
Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said
Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at LNG Capital LLP, a
London-based hedge fund he co-founded in 2006. Barclays bonds
have gained 0.08 percent since April 15, while debt of Lloyds
returned 0.41 percent, Bank of America data show. RBS bonds
gained 0.44 percent. Debt of ING Groep NV in Amsterdam was the
best bank performer globally, returning 0.65 percent. 
&#8220;There is significant upside in some of the European banks
as a result of the decimation they have taken over the past two
years,&#8221; Gargour said. &#8220;Systemic risks will be minimal for the
next few years and banks are sufficiently profitable in good
times to bear the burden of the proposed global bank tax.&#8221; 
The International Monetary Fund has recommended banks set
aside money to fund future bailouts. 
Bonds of the top five U.S. banks have all lost money for
investors since the SEC suit was filed. Fixed-income securities
of Morgan Stanley gave up 1.13 percent, Bank of America lost
0.72 percent, Citigroup Inc. lost 0.5 percent and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. lost 0.27 percent. 
A sovereign default by a country like Greece remains a risk
to financial firms in Europe, Evolution&#8217;s Jenkins said. European
banks had total claims on Greece including bonds and loans of
$193.1 billion as of Dec. 31, according to the Bank for
International Settlements. 
Lloyds said yesterday that its &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece and
Portugal isn&#8217;t material. RBS chairman Philip Hampton said his
firm has less than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) of Greece
debt.

Warren Buffett, who called Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. an &#8220;exceptional institution&#8221; when he invested
$5 billion in the firm, will have his biggest platform to
discuss the bank after it was sued for fraud by regulators and
pilloried in Congress. 
Buffett, who will host shareholders of his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. at the May 1 annual meeting, was a satisfied
Goldman Sachs client when he extended capital and credibility to
the firm during the credit crisis in 2008. Buffett has since
defended the bank amid public outrage about its pay and conduct,
drawing on a relationship that dates to a visit with a Goldman
Sachs executive in New York at the age of 10. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s more than 60 years of experience with Goldman
Sachs that&#8217;s talking,&#8221; said Jeff Matthews, author of
&#8220;Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Omaha&#8221; and founder of the
hedge fund Ram Partners LP. &#8220;Buffett is not going to be turning
around selling his Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
Buffett said people who feel cheated by the recession have
unfairly lashed out at Wall Street when regulators, mortgage
lenders and politicians should share the blame. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs
offering the apple,&#8221; Buffett said in a March 1 interview with
CNBC. 
The billionaire has &#8220;great confidence&#8221; in his investment,
according to Berkshire Director Thomas Murphy, who told 
Bloomberg Television that he spoke with Buffett after the  
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs on April 
16. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said 
he also spoke privately with Buffett after the lawsuit. 
Shareholder Questions 
Buffett will take about five hours of shareholder questions
at the meeting and, according to Murphy, should expect inquiries
about Goldman Sachs, which was accused of misleading clients on
the sale of mortgage-related investments. About 35,000 people
attended last year&#8217;s meeting at Omaha&#8217;s Qwest Center arena.
Buffett&#8217;s comments from the gathering and subsequent press
conference are read throughout the world. 
Buffett, a critic of Wall Street greed and corruption, has
supported a firm that&#8217;s been a lightning rod for criticism.
Public regard for Goldman Sachs plunged in the year and a half
since Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
bought preferred securities paying 10 percent interest. 
Berkshire makes $500 million a year in interest on the
Goldman Sachs perpetual preferred stock, which the bank may call
at any time by paying a 10 percent premium. The warrants Buffett
negotiated as part of the deal give Berkshire the option to buy
$5 billion of common stock for $115 a share. Berkshire&#8217;s paper
profit on the warrants was about $1.8 billion as of yesterday,
down from $3 billion before the SEC lawsuit was announced. 
Goldman Shares 
Goldman Sachs advanced $3.97, or 2.6 percent, to $157.01
yesterday in New York trading. The bank closed at $184.27 on
April 15. Berkshire rose $675 to $115,625. 
The transaction is reminiscent of a 1987 deal with Salomon
Inc. in which Buffett invested $700 million. 
Buffett was named interim chairman of Salomon in 1991 after
the firm was accused of misconduct in the Treasury debt auction
market, and he worked with regulators to restore the company&#8217;s
credibility. In testimony to Congress, he summarized his message
for Salomon employees: 
&#8220;Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding,&#8221;
Buffett said. &#8220;Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I
will be ruthless.&#8221; 
Senate Hearing 
Goldman Sachs executives endured more than 10 hours of
grilling before the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations on April 27 about their duty to clients and the
ethics of betting against the housing market as the bank sold
mortgage-linked securities. Michigan Democrat Carl Levin said he
was &#8220;troubled&#8221; that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to understand
conflicts of interest. 
Goldman Sachs has said the SEC suit is unfounded. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein told the committee. &#8220;The thing we are
selling to them is supposed to give them the risk they want.
They are not coming to us to represent what our views are.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs posted a record $13.4 billion profit in 2009,
a year after receiving $10 billion in a taxpayer bailout. It
repaid the funds with interest in June. 
Buffett told television interviewer Charlie Rose in
November that the bank didn&#8217;t need the bailout. As politicians
railed about bonuses, Buffett, the world&#8217;s third-richest person,
praised Blankfein and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying for
performance.&#8221; 
Finding a Target 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to expect vilification of banks,&#8221; Buffett
said in a January interview. &#8220;If I lost my job I&#8217;d be mad at
somebody, I&#8217;d probably be mad at everybody. And that&#8217;s human
nature. And it sometimes gets fanned by people to whom it&#8217;s to
their advantage to have a target.&#8221; 
The Goldman Sachs case is the SEC&#8217;s first contested lawsuit
against a major investment bank in more than a decade, and comes
as the regulator seeks to restore a reputation tarnished by its
failure to detect Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
Buffett, who has ridiculed investment bankers for the size
of their fees, relied on Goldman Sachs for some of his biggest
deals, including the $4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings
Inc. in 2008 and the $1.45 billion takeover of McLane Co. Those
deals were facilitated by Byron Trott, the former Goldman Sachs
managing director of whom Buffett said &#8220;I trust him
completely.&#8221; 
An Investing Icon 
At last year&#8217;s meeting, Buffett praised Wells Fargo  Co.
and dismissed the importance of government analysts who were
reviewing banks in an industrywide stress test. The San
Francisco-based bank jumped 44 percent the following week. 
&#8220;Warren Buffett is certainly an icon in terms of picking
the right companies and investing with a long-term strategy,&#8221;
said Jeff Resnick of Opinion Research Corp., a specialist in
brand and reputation consulting. A good reputation &#8220;will give
you a reservoir of goodwill among your most important
stakeholders.&#8221; 
Berkshire rose to first place this month in Harris
Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate reputations. Goldman
Sachs came in 56th out of 60. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s an important client as well as an investor,&#8221;
Blankfein said of Buffett in the April 27 Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for Warren.&#8221; 
Buffett said last year in Omaha that almost everyone
associated with finance, from bankers to regulators to insurers,
contributed to the crisis. 
&#8220;Some of it stemmed from greed, some from stupidity, some
from people saying the other guy was doing it,&#8221; Buffett said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may have
backed itself into a corner by speaking out quickly to counter
fraud claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In the two weeks since the SEC filed its lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs has released multiple written defenses, sent executives to
Capitol Hill for sworn testimony and put Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein on television to explain the firm&#8217;s conduct as
the housing market soured. While broadcasting its story, the New
York investment bank also has given regulators, lawmakers and
law enforcement agencies material to scour for contradictions
that could weaken its defense. 
SEC attorneys are already poring through the April 27
Senate testimony of Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old banker at
the center of the lawsuit, looking for any deviation from sworn
statements he made during the agency&#8217;s investigation, according
to a person familiar with the probe who declined to be
identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. 
&#8220;Going under oath and committing yourself before you have
any idea what kind of a case might be brought against you -- and
more particularly what the evidence in that case might be -- is
going to seriously curtail a defense lawyer&#8217;s ability to find
running room to defend you,&#8221; said Samuel Buell, a former
federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. 
Before the hearing, Tourre and Blankfein, 55, were
interviewed under oath by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
heads the panel, said he&#8217;s looking into whether they &#8220;tried to
fudge&#8221; their responses in the public hearing this week.
Blankfein will appear next week at the annual shareholders
meeting to answer questions related to the lawsuit. 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. 
Khuzami Meeting 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s chief of enforcement, said in a
closed meeting with Congressional staff on April 29 that it
wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate to discuss whether there are settlement
talks taking place, according to one person who attended and
spoke on condition of anonymity because the briefing was
private. Khuzami also declined to comment on why Tourre was the
only individual named in the lawsuit, the person said. 
The SEC&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit revolves around whether the firm
should have told investors in 2007 that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., helped pick the underlying securities for a collateralized
debt obligation -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t
accused of any wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Strategy 
While locking in testimony this early in the litigation
process posed risks, it was part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s strategy,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm&#8217;s
defense. Tourre&#8217;s public statements make it less likely that he
could change his story later and negotiate a lesser penalty with
the SEC in return for information that could be damaging to the
firm or other executives, the person said. 
Tourre, whose legal fees are paid by Goldman Sachs, said he
&#8220;categorically&#8221; denies the SEC&#8217;s allegations. He may have
testified to save his reputation and career, Buell said. 
&#8220;These guys&#8217; considerations aren&#8217;t just legal,&#8221; said
Buell. &#8220;They have to do with public relations, with reputation,
with their ability to continue to function the way they want to
in the business world.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock dropped 13 percent on the day the SEC
announced its case and declined 9.4 percent yesterday after
reports that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
the matter to determine whether to pursue a criminal fraud case. 
Along with two analyst downgrades, the scrutiny &#8220;puts the
pressure&#8221; on Goldman Sachs to try to settle sooner rather than
later, Matt McCormick, an analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in
Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8 billion, said yesterday in
a Bloomberg Television interview. 
In terms of public opinion, McCormick said, Goldman Sachs
has &#8220;already been condemned, the question is the price.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell in
New York trading after reports that federal prosecutors are
weighing criminal fraud charges against Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable firm and the stock was downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; at Bank of America Corp. 
Goldman Sachs dropped $15.04, or 9.4 percent, to $145.20 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares,
which doubled last year, have slumped 21 percent since April 15,
the day before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a civil lawsuit alleging the bank misled investors in
a mortgage-linked investment. 
Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
transactions by Goldman Sachs to determine whether to pursue a
criminal fraud case, according to two people familiar with the
matter. The review, which lawyers say is common in such a high-
profile case, is being done by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on
condition of anonymity. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings
power beyond what is discounted in the share price,&#8221; Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America, wrote in a report today. &#8220;However, it is very
difficult to see the shares making further progress until the
matter has been resolved.&#8221; 
Burden of Proof 
Bank of America also reduced its share-price estimate on
Goldman Sachs to $160 from $220, according to Moszkowski.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s equity analyst Matthew Albrecht cut his
recommendation on the shares today to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; and
reduced his price estimate to $140 from $180. 
The SEC suit said the bank created and sold collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages in early 2007, as
the U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles. The company called the SEC&#8217;s claims
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; 
The burden of proof in a criminal case would be higher than
in the SEC&#8217;s civil case. Criminal allegations have to be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Based on public reports about the SEC matter, a criminal
case may be difficult, said Douglas R. Jensen, an attorney with
Park  Jensen LLP in New York. The case appears &#8220;highly
complex&#8221; and Goldman Sachs would be able to make multiple
arguments in its defense, he said in an interview. 
Blankfein Speaks 
&#8220;In order to proceed criminally in a case, you need to
have very clear evidence of lying, cheating and stealing,&#8221; said
Jensen, a former deputy chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District of New York who
served on that office&#8217;s securities fraud task force. 
Goldman Sachs needs to be more transparent to stave off the
type of criticism the firm has recently endured, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein told National Public Radio. 
&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript dated
yesterday on NPR&#8217;s website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position
where activities seem to people as mysterious as they were at
the start of this crisis.&#8221; 
In an interview with CBS News earlier this week, he said,
&#8220;It is my belief that nothing unethical and nothing illegal has
happened, but I will tell you if I discovered something like
this, or any senior person at Goldman Sachs discovered illegal
or unethical behavior, we would eliminate that from the firm.&#8221; 
Goldman Annual Meeting 
Blankfein will be up for re-election as chairman when the
bank holds its annual shareholder meeting on May 7. Charles
Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested
$5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008, told CNBC today that he
admires Blankfein. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m favorably impressed by him,&#8221; Munger said in an
interview on the news channel. 
The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District
&#8220;pretty consistently&#8221; reviews SEC cases that are &#8220;higher
profile&#8221; such as those involving large dollar amounts or policy
issues, he said. The reviews may begin before the SEC files a
lawsuit. 
Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara, declined to comment. 
Full Cooperation 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the company would &#8220;fully cooperate with any
requests for information.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Given the recent focus on
the firm, we&#8217;re not surprised by the report of an inquiry.&#8221; 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation hasn&#8217;t opened a
criminal investigation, said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity and wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment publicly
on the matter. The Postal Inspection Service, which also could
investigate such cases, doesn&#8217;t have any open probes into
Goldman, said Tom Boyle, a spokesman for the agency in New York. 
Two former prosecutors for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said prosecutors
have their own investigators who may be examining the case
before determining whether to involve the FBI or postal
inspectors. The SEC may have provided documents and other
information to prosecutors gathered as part of its
investigation, allowing them to assess whether a criminal case
could be made, they said. 
Sixty-one House Democrats and one House Republican, led by
Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, sent a letter to
the Justice Department on April 23 asking Attorney General Eric
Holder to investigate Goldman Sachs, if the Justice Department
wasn&#8217;t already. The department will review the letter, Alisa
Finelli, a spokeswoman, said in an April 27 e-mail. 
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
trade and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued
Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president who helped create
the CDOs, known as Abacus.

Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, reported its largest profit increase in at
least a decade, exceeding analyst estimates, after recovering
economies around the world spurred increases in fuel demand. 
First-quarter net income more than doubled to $4.55
billion, or $2.27 a share, from $1.84 billion, or 92 cents, a
year earlier, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in
a statement. Excluding severance costs, per-share profit was
about $2.38, 43 cents higher than the average of 14 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson boosted oil and
natural-gas output by 4.5 percent with new wells from the Gulf
of Mexico to Australia. Watson is selling money-losing assets
and shifting capital to oil and natural-gas fields Chevron has
been working to bring online for years, said Edward Westlake, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. 
&#8220;Production was above expectations so it&#8217;s very hard to
shoot any holes in their story,&#8221; said Robbert Van Batenburg,
head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in New York. &#8220;As
long as they continue to bring new projects on line, it&#8217;s blue
skies ahead.&#8221; 
Worldwide demand for crude rose by 1.84 million barrels a
day during the first quarter, almost three times the growth rate
of the final three months of 2009, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Chevron fell 85 cents to $81.44 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock rose as
much as 1 percent after the earnings report was released this
morning. It has 19 buy and 6 hold ratings from analysts. 
Record Production 
Revenue jumped 33 percent to $48.2 billion, Chevron said.
The company&#8217;s oil and gas production increased to the equivalent
of 2.78 million barrels of crude a day, a company record, as new
wells started output in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Angola and the Gulf
of Mexico. 
Profit from oil and gas wells more than tripled to $4.72
billion as the prices the company was paid for crude and gas
surged 97 percent and 28 percent, respectively. 
Refining and chemicals earnings tumbled 74 percent to $196
million as higher crude prices squeezed margins on making
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 
Watson, 53, announced plans last month to reduce the
company&#8217;s refining workforce by 12 percent, sell Chevron&#8217;s only
remaining European refinery and shed other assets that aren&#8217;t
meeting internal profitability goals. 
Watson, who succeeded David O&#8217;Reilly as CEO on Jan. 1, is
contending with reduced access to some of the world&#8217;s biggest
remaining untapped oil fields. The refining restructuring
announced last month includes plans to sell more than 1,000
gasoline stations and 60 fuel-storage terminals. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 38 percent to
$6.3 billion.

Microsoft Corp., which some
analysts had predicted would make an offer for Palm Inc., won&#8217;t
bid after Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to acquire the maker of Pre
and Pixi phones this week. 
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, asked
whether the world&#8217;s largest software maker planned to make a
counteroffer, replied, &#8220;No we don&#8217;t.&#8221; Ballmer, who was
speaking at a conference in Mexico City, said the company also
will continue to invest in tablet-computer devices. 
Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is used in
Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s smartphones and tablet computers, stands to
lose if the computer maker replaces Windows with Palm&#8217;s
software. Earlier this year, Eric Risley, founder of Architect
Partners, a Menlo Park, California-based merger-and-acquisition
advisory firm, suggested that Microsoft could be a suitor for
Palm. 
Hewlett-Packard has canceled plans for a Windows-based
tablet, expected to go on sale later this year, TechCrunch
reported yesterday, citing a person it didn&#8217;t name. 
Microsoft spokesman Bill Cox declined to comment on
specific products today. &#8220;H-P is a strategic partner of
Microsoft and will continue to be,&#8221; he said. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 47 cents to
$30.53 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needs to
be more transparent to stave off the type of criticism the firm
has recently endured, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
told National Public Radio. 
&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript on NPR&#8217;s
website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position where activities
seem to people as mysterious as they were at the start of this
crisis.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which generates more trading revenue than
any other Wall Street firm, faces a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil fraud lawsuit over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security and is under scrutiny by federal criminal
prosecutors. Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
tried to defend the firm&#8217;s actions this week when he was
interrogated by a U.S. Senate subcommittee. 
&#8220;Someone like Goldman Sachs has never been in the consumer
business and never really had to get out and explain to the
public at large how we do our business,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to the transcript, dated yesterday. &#8220;And now I&#8217;m
afraid it&#8217;s become very, very important for us to do that.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds, played
a role in creating the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, Blankfein told NPR. 
&#8216;Contributed to Crisis&#8217; 
&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So,
for example, Goldman Sachs did transactions for companies that
involved lending them a lot of money, maybe too much money. We
financed real estate that was probably overleveraged.&#8221; 
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 8.4 percent, or $13.42, to
$146.82 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock is down about 20 percent since April 15, the
day before the SEC filed suit. 
In the future, Blankfein said, Goldman Sachs and the
industry as a whole should be better at spotting bubbles in the
markets if they occur and better at absorbing the effects of
those bubbles. 
&#8220;If institutions can&#8217;t absorb it and don&#8217;t have the
financial wherewithal to deal with the problems as they arise,
at least we have to have a system in place where financial
systems can be put out of business in a way that doesn&#8217;t
jeopardize the entire system by creating system risk,&#8221;
Blankfein added, according to the transcript. 
Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s allegations and that it
will &#8220;fully cooperate&#8221; with any requests for information from
federal prosecutors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as federal prosecutors
investigate the firm to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs increased the most
since the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil lawsuit
filing on April 16, as a federal review begins by the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said two people familiar with the matter,
who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bank of America Corp. cut its rating on the shares to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing the probe. 
Credit swaps on Goldman Sachs climbed 25.8 basis points to
157.4 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. Swaps on other
banks, including Morgan Stanley to Bank of America, also rose. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
rose 0.98 basis point to a mid-price of 90.31 basis points as of
10:47 a.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index
typically falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates. 
Swaps on Morgan Stanley rose 10.2 basis points to 162.7
basis points, CMA prices show. Contracts on Bank of America
climbed 8.3 basis points to 135.7, and swaps on JPMorgan Chase 
Co. increased 8 basis points to 82.6. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Goldman also recruited Albert Sagiryan, a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. vice president for debt origination in Moscow, according to
the people, who declined to be identified before the new
positions have been made official. 
Wall Street firms are competing for bankers as Russia&#8217;s
economy recovers from its worst contraction on record. Companies
will probably sell a record 1 trillion rubles ($34 billion) of
domestic bonds this year, according to Trust Investment Bank and
ING Groep NV. Both UBS AG and Renaissance Capital forecast
Russian companies will raise $20 billion in initial public
offerings. 
Goldman hired Christopher Barter to head its Russian office
on Jan. 29 and recruited former OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Tav Morgan to improve its commodities
business in the former Soviet Union. 
Hiring Spree 
Morgan Stanley hired Gergely Voros and Dmitry Avdeev as co-
heads of investment banking for Russia, replacing Yan Tavrovsky,
who left the bank earlier this year, according to a statement
April 27. Avdeev will resign as chief financial officer of
Russian oilfield service company Integra Group to return to
Morgan Stanley while Voros is London-based head of emerging
equity capital markets at the bank. 
Credit Suisse recruited five fixed-income specialists last
month, including three from Deutsche Bank AG, while Renaissance
Capital appointed Credit Suisse&#8217;s Nikolai Yukovich to run its
emerging-markets currency team. Otkritie Financial Corp., a
local brokerage part-owned by VTB Group, in March took on 18
people for its new debt and currency market units. 
Goldman Sachs was the 10th biggest arranger of Eurobonds
for Russian companies in 2007-2009, organizing sales by OAO
Gazprom, OAO Transneft and Russian Agricultural Bank, according
to Bloomberg data. The company missed out on winning a role on
Russia&#8217;s first international bond sale this month since 1989
after making the shortlist of 22 banks. 
Goldman declined to comment and Djumaliev and Sagiryan
could not be reached for comment. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named
ICICI Bank Ltd.&#8217;s Sonjoy Chatterjee as managing director and co-
chief executive officer of its Indian operations. 
L. Brooks Entwistle, who has helmed operations in India for
the last four years, will oversee the Indian unit with
Chatterjee, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
statement today. 
The U.S. lender, which offers investment banking and
research services in India, is seeking a license for commercial
banking in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. 
Goldman Sachs ranks 16th in managing share sales in India
this year, lagging behind rivals such as Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley, according to Bloomberg data. On advising clients
on mergers and acquisitions, it ranks 11th, behind Barclays
Plc&#8217;s investment bank and Standard Chartered Plc, the data show. 
ICICI Bank, based in Mumbai, ranked 11th on managing
share sales and wasn&#8217;t among the top 20 banks in takeover
advisory, the data show. Chatterjee had been an executive
director at the company since 1997. 
India&#8217;s second-largest lender appointed Rajiv Sabharwal to
the board, according to a filing from the Mumbai-based bank to

There is &#8220;no guarantee&#8221; the U.K.
will retain its AAA credit rating and the election campaign has
revealed little about what the next government will do to cut
the budget deficit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
With a U.K. election next week, Goldman Sachs economists
Ben Broadbent and Adrian Paul said the U.K.&#8217;s prospects for
fiscal retrenchment, economic growth and interest rates look a
&#8220;little better&#8221; in general than Spain&#8217;s. Having a free-
floating exchange rate will also benefit the U.K., they said. 
&#8220;While that probably helps to explain why the U.K. has
retained its AAA so far, it is no guarantee that it will over
the future,&#8221; the London-based economists wrote in a note to
clients late yesterday. &#8220;All three rating agencies have
expressed concern about the existing government&#8217;s fiscal plans
and the election campaign has brought us precious little clarity
about what the next government will do.&#8221; 
The U.K. ran a budget deficit of 11.5 percent of gross
domestic product last year and has a government debt of 68.1
percent of GDP, according to the EU&#8217;s statistics office.

Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said a &#8220;callousness&#8221;
toward clients demonstrated in some e-mails released to the
public this week is unacceptable and doesn&#8217;t represent the firm. 
&#8220;There were some e-mails where some people were projecting
I would say, at best indifference, and at worst a callousness,&#8221;
Blankfein, 55, said in an interview on the &#8220;Charlie Rose&#8221;
television show last night, according to a transcript. While he
said those e-mails aren&#8217;t representative of the firm, &#8220;it&#8217;s
inexcusable if 10 people think that way or thought that way.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street firm that generates more
trading revenue than any other, has lost 21 percent of its
market value since it was sued on April 16 by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security. It is also under criminal investigation by
federal prosecutors, said two people familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;The firm is guiltless and this is a big preoccupation for
me and a big preoccupation for our management group,&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. 
Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
defended the firm&#8217;s actions this week under interrogation from a
U.S. Senate subcommittee, which released 901 pages of documents
including e-mail that showed employees disparaging securities
they were offering to clients. 
Most of the complex derivatives the firm developed and
traded had a &#8220;social utility,&#8221; he said, while others may have
gone too far. 
&#8216;Hindsight&#8217; Regrets 
&#8220;If the issuants themselves are too complicated, become
too illiquid as it turns out that they were, notwithstanding the
purpose you may say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s not do those things,&#8217;&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So in hindsight I wish we
had not done some of those things.&#8221; 
The stock fell 9.4 percent yesterday to $145.20, in New
York trading, its biggest drop since the SEC brought the suit on
April 16. The company has lost $21 billion in market value since
the case was filed. 
Blankfein said Goldman Sachs will survive and &#8220;thrive&#8221; in
the future. He said he would step down if his leadership damaged
the firm, calling that scenario unlikely. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here,&#8221; he said, according to the transcript.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my expectation and that&#8217;s my duty.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs must improve communication with the public,
Blankfein said. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge challenge, I would just say it&#8217;s my
deficiency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t exist in the current state
that we&#8217;re in and we understand that. So we have a lot of work
to do.&#8221; 
Stunning News 
News of the SEC suit came as a shock, Blankfein said. 
&#8220;It was in the middle of the morning, it was stunning,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I saw it over the screen. I read it, and my -- it
just -- my stomach turned over. I couldn&#8217;t -- I was stunned.&#8221; 
Blankfein defended the role that Goldman Sachs, and Wall
Street as a whole, plays in making markets. 
&#8220;You could call it a casino, but if it is, it&#8217;s a very
socially important casino,&#8221; he said. 
On congressional efforts to strengthen financial
regulation, Blankfein said he supports many aspects of the bill
proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
The so-called Volcker Rule, which would require banks to exit
the business of trading for their own account, or proprietary
trading, would eliminate about 10 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
revenue, Blankfein said. 
&#8220;There are aspects of the Volcker rule that go too far,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I work very hard for the 10 percent of our revenue.&#8221; 
In an interview to be aired tomorrow on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed
Zakaria GPS,&#8221; Blankfein said parts of the Volcker rule &#8220;are
warranted&#8221; and he &#8221;could&#8221; support them. 
&#8220;If it makes institutions safer, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But if it makes institutions forgo revenue opportunities, that
fact by itself is bad.&#8221; 
Contributing to Crisis 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds,
inadvertently helped cause the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, Blankfein said in an interview with National
Public Radio on April 29. 
&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein told NPR, according to a transcript of
that interview. &#8220;So, for example, Goldman Sachs did
transactions for companies that involved lending them a lot of
money, maybe too much money. We financed real estate that was
probably overleveraged.&#8221; 
Blankfein told CNN the firm must &#8220;regain the trust of the
public&#8221; to survive. &#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to a transcript of the interview. &#8220;We can&#8217;t survive
without people thinking well of us.&#8221; 
In the CNN interview, Blankfein also said former Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson called him during the financial crisis
and that Paulson was being &#8220;very, very careful to be
appropriate.&#8221; 
Blankfein said, &#8220;the conversations would be &#8216;What are you
seeing? What are you hearing? What are your clients saying? How
are the markets?&#8217;&#8221; 
Paulson had been head of Goldman Sachs before going to the
Treasury Department. Paulson isn&#8217;t connected to the hedge fund
by the same name.

Johnson  Johnson is recalling some
liquid infant&#8217;s and children&#8217;s pain relievers and allergy
medicine because the drugs&#8217; quality and potency may be unsafe. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement
JJ&#8217;s McNeil Consumer Healthcare is voluntarily recalling some
liquid Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl because of
&#8220;manufacturing deficiencies&#8221; that could affect quality, purity
or potency of the drugs. 
McNeil said in a separate statement the recall involves
over-the-counter infant and children&#8217;s drops and liquid Tylenol,
Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl in sizes ranging from 0.5 ounces (14
milliliters) to 4 ounces. Some of the products may have more of
the active drug, while others may have inactive ingredients that
didn&#8217;t meet standards or may contain small particles, the
drugmaker said. 
The New Brunswick-based company said the likelihood of any
serious reactions is &#8220;remote,&#8221; although it urged consumers who
have the products not to use them. 
Johnson  Johnson shares fell 71 cents yesterday to $64.30

transcript of the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t survive without people thinking well of us.&#8221; 
The firm is the target of a Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit that revolves around whether it should have
told investors that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., helped select
the underlying securities for a collateralized debt obligation
and then bet against it. Paulson  Co. wasn&#8217;t accused of any
wrongdoing in the matter, which dates back to 2007. 
In the interview, Blankfein said &#8220;I could&#8221; support the
Volcker rule, which would place restrictions on investments

proposal, by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, &#8220;are
warranted.&#8221;

&#8220;We were a lender. We lent money to companies&#8221; and &#8220;real

General Growth Properties Inc. will
support a revised financing proposal led by Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. in bankruptcy court after receiving a new
takeover bid from rival mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. 
Brookfield and its partners, Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LP, made a proposal
with &#8220;significantly enhanced terms&#8221; over the group&#8217;s original
investment agreement, Chicago-based General Growth said in court
documents filed in Manhattan today. General Growth plans to move
forward with the Brookfield group even as it reviews a &#8220;whole
company&#8221; bid received yesterday from Simon, the filing said. 
Simon offered about $6 billion to take over General Growth
and said it would pay down about $7 billion of unsecured debt, a
person with knowledge of the new bid said. The Indianapolis-
based company will drop its offer should the Brookfield group
receive warrants that will be issued if its plan is approved by
the bankruptcy court, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the details of the new offer aren&#8217;t yet public. 
General Growth is scheduled to go before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan May 5 to seek approval of the
Brookfield-led plan. Simon, spurned in a $10 billion takeover
offer for its biggest rival in February, had previously offered
to match the terms of Brookfield&#8217;s proposal while omitting a
provision that would require General Growth to issue stock
warrants. 
&#8216;One-Horse Race&#8217; 
&#8220;General Growth has concluded that accepting a minority
investment from Simon Property Group -- even one without the
warrants -- would likely deter other parties from putting
together a competing proposal and overall create a one-horse
race,&#8221; lawyers for General Growth wrote in the filing. 
Les Morris, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based Simon, said
he had no comment. 
The latest Brookfield proposal has as much as $7 billion in
equity commitments -- $500 million more than the prior one --
and includes an optional backstop for $1.5 billion in debt
financing if the company asks for it, according to court
documents. 
General Growth&#8217;s board favors the Brookfield deal because
it will foster more competitive bidding, including the potential
sale of the company before or after its exit from bankruptcy,
the company&#8217;s lawyers wrote. 
Warrant Changes 
Under the new plan, Brookfield and its partners would get
40 percent of the warrants they&#8217;re seeking once their proposal
is approved by the court. They would receive 20 percent more on
July 12, and the remainder over the course of their commitment
to General Growth. Staggering the warrants would lower the extra
price another bidder, such as Simon, would have to pay should it
make an offer for the company. 
Brookfield and its partners also agreed to increase the
strike price of their warrants. Once General Growth emerges from
bankruptcy, they will have warrants to buy shares of a newly
formed General Growth Properties at $10.50 each, up from $10
under the previous plan. 
Simon estimates the 120 million warrants could cost General
Growth shareholders $895 million, while General Growth has put
their value at about $519 million. Simon Chief Executive Officer
David Simon said last week that the warrants would make General
Growth &#8220;too expensive&#8221; to purchase. 
New Bid 
Under Simon&#8217;s new offer, the company would pay $13.25
a share for the new General Growth Properties -- $10 in Simon
stock, and $3.25 in cash -- and would back-stop the $5-a-share
offering for a company to be spun off, General Growth
Opportunities, said the person familiar with the plan.&#160;Simon
also would pay down about $7 billion in unsecured General Growth
debt and assume more than $20 billion of mortgages, the person
said.
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Simon doesn&#8217;t plan to make any more offers for General
Growth should its latest one be turned down, the person said. 
Brookfield is seeking so-called stalking horse status with
its bid, making it the first to set a value for General Growth. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest

Disney, owner of ESPN, the ABC broadcast network and Disney

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. should
replace its top executives because they failed to understand the
politics of the financial crisis and mishandled regulators&#8217;
claims of fraud against the firm, according to Richard Bove, an
analyst at Rochdale Securities. 
&#8220;Goldman is going to have to pay a high price for its
ineptitude,&#8221; Bove wrote in a note to investors yesterday. &#8220;Its
shareholders already have.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs lost 21 percent of its value on the New York
Stock Exchange in two weeks after the company was sued on April
16 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said
the New York-based company misled investors in a mortgage-linked
investment. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the
matter, people familiar with the matter said last week, and
Goldman Sachs executives were grilled by a U.S. Senate panel. 
Senior management failed to understand that the government
has chosen to make Goldman Sachs &#8220;an example of all of the
evils in the financial system that caused the &#8216;Great
Recession,&#8217;&#8221; Bove wrote. The company behaved defensively and
with technical arguments, rather than proactively by redefining
the debate and talking about the service that Goldman Sachs
provides to the country, according to Bove. 
&#8220;It should have understood the size and enormity of the
forces being brought against it,&#8221; Bove wrote. &#8220;It did not.
Thus, its responses were weak and ineffectual.&#8221; 
$1 Billion Settlement 
Bove wrote that he expects &#8220;high-level executives are
going to have to be removed from their positions both in the
management suite and from the board of directors.&#8221; He also
expects that the firm will pay a fine of at least $1 billion to
settle the SEC&#8217;s suit and will need to replace its legal team
with one that has greater &#8220;Washington know-how.&#8221; Finally, he
expects the firm will develop a new mission statement. 
Still, Bove said he doesn&#8217;t advocate selling Goldman Sachs
stock. 
&#8220;Despite its political naivet&#233;, it is still the best
trading company in the world and the world needs to trade,&#8221;
Bove wrote. 
The shares, down 11 percent this year, rose $4.30, or 3
percent, to $149.50 at 4 p.m.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., buffeted by
a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and a 21 percent decline in market value, is in talks to hire
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its
legal team, said a person briefed on the discussions. 
The talks are likely to lead to an agreement to hire the
firm, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
negotiations are confidential. The intention is to supplement,
not replace, the company&#8217;s current legal advisers including
Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, the person said. 
Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, is seeking additional legal advice as it faces
issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
week, according to the person. Federal prosecutors are also
investigating the firm&#8217;s activities in the area, people familiar
with the matter said last week. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Madelaine Miller, a spokeswoman for
Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s move to hire Paul, Weiss would echo a
similar decision made last year by Bank of America Corp. in
litigation with the SEC in federal court. The bank, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, hired Paul, Weiss to augment a legal
team led by Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton LLP. 
Citigroup, AIG, Spitzer 
Paul, Weiss has also advised clients including Citigroup
Inc., American International Group Inc., former New York
Governor Eliot Spitzer and former vice presidential aide Lewis
&#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby. 
Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said first-quarter profit rose more than analysts
estimated as products added from the acquisition of Wyeth
overcame costs from the U.S. health overhaul. The shares gained. 
Profit excluding certain items was 60 cents a share,
beating the 53 cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income decreased 26 percent to $2.03 billion, or
25 cents a share, from $2.73 billion, or 40 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. 
Pfizer counts the pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and the
depression pill Effexor among the medicines gained in its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth, completed in October. Products from
Wyeth contributed more than $3 billion to Pfizer&#8217;s sales in the
quarter. The health-care law, enacted in March, cut revenue for
the period by $56 million, the company said. 
&#8220;Results came in better than expected, both from slightly
higher sales -- about 1 percent more than we were looking for --
and from cost saves,&#8221; Joel Levington, managing director of
corporate credit for Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in
New York, said in an e-mail. 
Pfizer increased 35 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $17.26 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest gain among companies in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The shares have lost 5.1 percent this year.

Walt Disney Co. said owners of Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad played more than 1.5 million episodes of ABC
television shows since the computer went on sale. 
More than 400,000 copies of the free ABC player have been
downloaded since April 3, Burbank, California-based Disney said
today in an e-mailed statement announcing additional features.
Free shows are sponsored by advertisers. Others are for sale
from the Apple&#8217;s iTunes store, Disney said. 
The world&#8217;s biggest media company is seeking new ways to
deliver TV shows as viewers shift to the Internet and video
games for entertainment. Disney was the first to sell
commercial-free TV shows on the iTunes media store and was the
first to provide ad-supported shows at the ABC website. Disney
is also an investor in the Hulu.com video site with News Corp.&#8217;s
Fox and General Electric Co.&#8217;s NBC. 
Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said yesterday
1 million iPad tablet computers were sold in April after the
device&#8217;s release, outpacing the original iPhone. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs is Disney&#8217;s largest individual
shareholder. 
The new version of ABC&#8217;s player software released today
supports new iPads with 3G wireless Internet and improves the
rewind and fast-forward functions, Disney said. 
Disney fell 85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.72 at 1:51
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Before today
the shares had climbed 16 percent this year. 
Apple slid $6.88, or 2.6 percent, to $259.47 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market trading and had gained 26 percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s execution
and clearing unit agreed to pay NYSE Euronext and the Securities
and Exchange Commission $450,000 to settle allegations it broke
rules governing short sales on U.S. stocks because of a
bookkeeping error. 
Goldman Sachs was censured for violating the SEC&#8217;s
Regulation SHO, which sets rules for handling bearish trades in
equities. The infractions, which are unrelated to the SEC&#8217;s
April 16 mortgage-related fraud suit against the world&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank, involved requirements implemented in
September 2008 to reduce naked short selling, in which firms
sell stock short without intending to borrow the shares required
to complete their obligations. 
An emergency SEC rule implemented after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s collapse in September 2008 forced brokers to
close short sales that didn&#8217;t settle by the morning of the
fourth day after the trade. That regulation, called Rule 204T,
also imposed stricter requirements on subsequent short sales
when failures to deliver shares occurred. The rule was made
permanent in July 2009. 
Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP &#8220;initially responded
to the rule by implementing procedures that were inadequate in
that they relied too heavily on individuals to perform manual
tasks and calculations, without sufficient oversight or
verification of accuracy,&#8221; the SEC said today. 
Updating a Spreadsheet 
The SEC said in its order that New York-based Goldman Sachs
failed to close out positions on Dec. 9, 2008, because an
employee in the firm&#8217;s operations department didn&#8217;t correctly
update a spreadsheet used to calculate market-maker obligations
related to short sales. While the company corrected the mistake
after the market opened that day, two market makers on NYSE Arca
were unable to conduct business in two securities for three
days, the SEC said. 
The SEC also said Goldman Sachs failed to close out market-
maker positions on 46 occasions in 38 securities in January
2009. The commission said the failures resulted from the firm&#8217;s
&#8220;error in calculating its potential T+6 obligations,&#8221; referring
to the requirement that certain trades by market makers be
closed out by the morning of the sixth day after the transaction
occurred. These errors were the result of an employee
incorrectly removing a number used in calculations of short-sale
close-out obligations. 
&#8216;Processing Error&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
&#8220;This was the result of a manual processing error
following the changes in Rule 204T closeout requirements in
October 2008,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday said in a
statement. &#8220;There was no financial impact on our clients. We
now have improved, automated processes in place to avoid future
errors.&#8221; 
The company clears an average of 3 million trades a day,
said Canaday, who added that an automated system began in May
2009. 
NYSE said that from around Dec. 9, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009,
the Goldman Sachs unit failed about 68 times to close out
positions after short sales had failed to settle. Goldman Sachs
also didn&#8217;t notify customers that short sales in particular
stocks had failed to settle on time, the exchange said. 
Goldman Sachs improperly accepted about 385 short-sale
orders from customers over the same time period, NYSE said.
Existing failed positions in specific securities required the
firm to accept only short-sale orders in those stocks when the
shares had been arranged to be borrowed in advance, which it
didn&#8217;t do, NYSE said. The broker also failed to &#8220;reasonably
supervise and implement adequate controls&#8221; to ensure short-sale
rules were met from Sept. 24, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009, NYSE said.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S.
bank by assets, named Michele Colocci head of its merger-and-
acquisition group in Europe, replacing Dieter Turowski. 
Turowski, 44, will become global co-head of the natural-
resources advisory group in London alongside Carl Contiguglia,
who works in New York, said Morgan Stanley spokesman Michael Wang. Charlie Stewart, previously head of Latin American
investment banking, will replace Colocci as deputy head of
European investment banking, Wang said. 
Morgan Stanley was the top-ranked adviser on announced
European deals last year, advising on mergers worth at least
$187 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New
York-based firm ranks seventh this year with about $6.66 billion
of deals, the data show. The biggest transaction in 2010 was
advising flash-chip maker Numonyx Holdings BV on a $1.27 billion
offer from Micron Technology Inc. 
European MA activity plunged in April, which was the worst
month for takeovers in the region for 1 1/2 years, with the
total value of transactions dropping to $32.8 billion from
$106.6 billion in March, according to Bloomberg data. That&#8217;s the
lowest level since November 2008, two months after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
Colocci, 46, joined Morgan Stanley in 2004 from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and was most recently chairman of European MA, Wang
said. He holds a bachelor of economics from Williams College and
an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. 
Turowski, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, had been head
of European MA since early 2009, after replacing Gavin MacDonald. Before that Turowski was head of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
German MA team based in Frankfurt and he also worked in the
bank&#8217;s telecommunications, media and technology team, Wang said. 
Scott Matlock will become chairman of international MA in
London, Wang said. He was previously chairman of Asian mergers
and acquisitions in Hong Kong. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the appointments earlier
today on its website.

Highbridge Capital Management LLC, a
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s asset management unit,
hired David Frey of Stanfield Capital Partners LLC after that
company sold $5.15 billion of leveraged loans and other credits
to Carlyle Group. 
Frey, 43, started at New York-based Highbridge as a
managing director yesterday, according to a statement. Before
joining Stanfield as a portfolio manager in 2004, he oversaw
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans as an analyst at Katonah
Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management LP. 
&#8220;David&#8217;s expertise will enhance our existing loan
activities and further strengthen our ability to serve
investors,&#8221; Scott Kapnick, chief executive officer of
Highbridge Principal Strategies, said in the statement. 
After earning a master&#8217;s of business administration at
Columbia University in 1993, Frey joined Morgan Stanley. As a
principal in the investment banking unit, he managed new issue
transactions including high-yield, high-risk loans and bonds,
bridge financing, convertible and initial public offerings. 
Frey is a board vice chairman of the Loan Syndications and
Trading Association, a New York-based trade group. 
Highbridge, founded in 1992, has about $21 billion of
assets under management, according to the statement. The
Principal Strategies unit manages about $4 billion in mezzanine
debt, loans, public credit securities and growth equity, the
firm said. 
Carlyle, the Washington-based private equity firm, last
week won an auction to buy management contracts on $4.2 billion
of loans, which are packaged inside collateralized debt
obligations, and $950 million of managed accounts containing
similar securities from Stanfield in a bid to capitalize on a
recovery in loan prices and to expand its $13 billion of credit
investments.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s employee
morale remains good and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
received a standing ovation from partners at an April 20
earnings call, analyst Brad Hintz told clients. 
According to the firm, &#8220;employees are pulling together
like a team under pressure,&#8221; Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today after a
meeting with five senior executives at Goldman Sachs. &#8220;The
partnership has closed ranks, too, and at Goldman&#8217;s April 20,
2010, managing directors earnings call, Lloyd Blankfein received
a standing ovation from his partners.&#8221; 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New
York-based firm on April 16, and a Senate panel grilled
executives including Blankfein on April 27. Federal prosecutors
also are investigating the firm, people familiar with the matter
said last week. Analyst Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities LLC
said May 2 the firm&#8217;s top executives should be replaced for
mishandling the financial crisis and fraud claims. 
Hintz, who rates Goldman Sachs stock &#8220;outperform,&#8221; wrote
his note following an April 30 meeting with Goldman Sachs
President Gary Cohn, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Co-
Head of Investment Banking David Solomon, as well as Harvey Schwartz and David Heller, two of the co-heads of the securities
division. 
Stock Reaction 
Goldman Sachs stock dropped 21 percent from its close on
April 15, the day before the SEC filed charges, and its close on
April 30, the day after reports that federal prosecutors are
investigating the company. The stock rose $4.30, or 3 percent,
to $149.50 yesterday, and traded at $148.58 at 9:48 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Hintz is predicting the
stock will reach $210. 
The executives told Hintz that so far they&#8217;ve seen &#8220;no
degradation&#8221; of their client business, although clients keep
asking &#8220;when is this going to stop,&#8221; Hintz wrote. Hintz added
that the SEC case may continue for &#8220;quite a while&#8221; because the
firm doesn&#8217;t want to admit to a violation. 
Goldman Sachs management confirmed to Hintz that Monday
April 19, the first business day after the SEC case was filed,
was the firm&#8217;s largest day for equity commissions so far this
year, Hintz wrote. 
&#8220;Admittedly, Goldman Sachs has incurred reputation damage
and may suffer client fallout due to this case,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
&#8220;It is arguably difficult for a portfolio manager to buy or own
GS in an ERISA portfolio, a separately managed account or in a
mutual fund due to the current public outrage against the
firm.&#8221; ERISA refers to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974. 
Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed that
Blankfein got a standing ovation. Robinson declined to comment
on the rest of Hintz&#8217;s note. 
New Regulations 
The uncertainty of new regulations is the &#8220;greatest
strategic challenge facing Goldman Sachs today,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
Viniar said that the firm is &#8220;war-gaming a bunch of scenarios&#8221;
to prepare for different potential regulatory changes, Hintz
said. 
The firm estimates that about 75 percent to 80 percent of
derivatives that are currently traded over the counter will move
on to exchanges as the result of new regulation, Hintz said. The
rest are the &#8220;highly profitable, tailored segment&#8221; of the
business that will, under the current version of the Senate
bill, have to be originated outside of the company&#8217;s regulated
bank subsidiary, Hintz said. 
&#8220;This would force banks to move their fixed income
derivatives books from the bank subsidiary (that is FDIC
protected and has access to the Fed window) to a new separately
capitalized (and lower rated) derivatives subsidiary that would
likely be guaranteed by the bank holding company,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
&#8220;Goldman already operates its OTC fixed-income derivatives book
out of such a subsidiary and would not have to use new capital
to support this subsidiary.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is also planning a &#8220;fair amount of hiring&#8221;
in every part of its trading business this year, Hintz wrote.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. apologized after
James Glassman, a senior economist at the bank, said members of
the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showed
ignorance of market economics. 
&#8220;The report is from a single economist and does not
reflect the views of our firm,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman
Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4 statement. &#8220;We disagree
with his characterizations, and we&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; 
Glassman, according to a copy of his May 3 note on the
Huffington Post&#8217;s website, criticized the &#8220;low level of
economic literacy&#8221; shown as the panel, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current and former executives from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. on April 27. The panel examined the bank&#8217;s duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market
while selling mortgage-linked securities. 
&#8220;The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while,&#8221; Glassman wrote, according to the note. &#8220;Now that the
financial reform debate is in the final innings, it&#8217;s time for
the grownups to step in.&#8221; 
In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan. The note included a graph
depicting the state&#8217;s employment decline since 2000 compared
with that of other states, which was titled &#8220;People who live in
glass houses shouldn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221; Levin, a Democrat who was
not named in the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. 
Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said the lawmaker
didn&#8217;t plan to issue a statement. Glassman didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment after normal business hours. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment today. 
The Senate is debating a sweeping rewrite of rules
governing Wall Street, intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis that led the U.S. to extend $700 billion in
taxpayer funds to firms including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
Several senators said evidence presented at the April 27 hearing
supported the case for Congress to pass the legislation.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was late in
notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that
trader Fabrice Tourre might be sued for fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar
with the matter. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t update Finra on Tourre&#8217;s status until
this week, more than two weeks after the SEC filed a lawsuit
against him and the firm for allegedly misleading investors
about a mortgage-linked security, the people said. Under Finra&#8217;s
rules, Goldman Sachs should have updated Tourre&#8217;s file within 30
days of his receiving a so-called Wells notice from the SEC last
year. 
Penalties for failing to update Finra can include censure,
fines, suspension or expulsion from the brokerage industry. In
2004, Finra&#8217;s predecessor organization, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, fined 29 firms more than $9.2 million for
more than 8,000 late disclosures of reportable information about
their brokers and prohibited two firms, Morgan Stanley and
Wachovia, from registering new brokers for five business days. 
Goldman Sachs and Tourre are contesting the SEC&#8217;s suit. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the lapse on its website
earlier today. Spokesmen for Finra and Goldman Sachs both
declined to comment.

Microsoft Corp. will start selling its
Kin mobile phones online tomorrow with Verizon Wireless, the
biggest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, as the software company tries
to take back ground in the fast-growing smartphone market. 
The Kin One will sell for $49.99 after a $100 rebate and a
two-year service contract, the companies said in a statement.
The Kin Two, with a larger screen and higher-resolution camera,
will cost $99.99. Both phones go on sale in stores on May 13. 
Microsoft is aiming to use the phones to regain momentum
against Google Inc. and Apple Inc. in the smartphone market.
Devices running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system fell to 7.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone market in the fourth
quarter, down from 12.5 percent a year earlier, according to ABI
Research. Apple&#8217;s iPhone and phones using Google&#8217;s Android
software gained, passing Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. 
The Kin phones are aimed at young mobile-phone users who
like to stay in touch with social networks. Customers will
listen to music through Microsoft&#8217;s Zune system and must sign up
for a Windows Live account to set up the device. 
&#8220;The stage of life and who these people are, they&#8217;re
exploring, sharing and trying to define themselves,&#8221; said Eric
Hermelee, product management director for Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
communications business. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to be authentic to the
brand.&#8221; 
Video Chats 
The company is working on improvements to its Windows Live
products, such as high-definition video chat services that
display social network updates, Brian Hall, general manager for
Microsoft Windows Live, said in an interview last month. 
The phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain and
the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. 
Microsoft dropped 28 cents to $29.85 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 4 p.m. New York time. The shares have declined 2.1
percent this year. New York-based Verizon Communications Inc.,
which co-owns the wireless company with Vodafone, fell 7 cents
to $28.68 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The Kins have slide-out keyboards and let users check
friends&#8217; messages and status updates on Facebook and Myspace
from their home screens. Customers will have to sign up for an
unlimited data contract for $29.99 a month, in addition to a
$39.99 calling plan, to use the phone, boosting Basking Ridge,
New Jersey-based Verizon&#8217;s sales. 
&#8216;Attractive&#8217; Pricing 
The price of the Kin phones may help draw customers, said
Michael Gartenberg, a partner at Altimeter Group. 
&#8220;The pricing of the devices is very attractive,&#8221; said
Gartenberg. &#8220;They&#8217;re competitive with feature phones that do an
awful lot less. The service fee might be much more palatable,
given the initial cost of acquisition is attractive.&#8221; 
Verizon is relying on data plan sales to maintain growth as
the market for mobile customers becomes saturated. There are
more than nine wireless devices for every 10 people in the U.S.,
according to the CTIA wireless industry association. 
Overall, average monthly bills for customers last quarter

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s credit
rating outlook was cut to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable&#8221; by Fitch
Ratings, which said legal actions and regulatory changes could
hurt the firm&#8217;s reputation and ability to earn money. 
The long- and short-term issuer default ratings on New
York-based Goldman Sachs were affirmed at A+ and F+, Fitch said
today in a statement. Fitch said it&#8217;s unlikely that the long-
term rating would be cut below the A category. A+ is the fifth-
highest rating given by Fitch. 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year,
was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
fraud last month and was subjected to a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week that questioned its practices in underwriting
and selling mortgage-linked securities. Federal prosecutors are
also investigating the company, people familiar with the
situation said last week. 
&#8220;The rating outlook revision to negative incorporates
recent legal developments and ongoing regulatory challenges that
could adversely impact Goldman&#8217;s reputation and revenue
generating capacity,&#8221; Fitch wrote in today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;For
financial services companies, particularly those dependent on
the capital markets, reputation is critically important.&#8221; 
Fitch also pointed to regulatory changes under
consideration, including higher capital requirements, central
clearing of derivatives, restricted proprietary trading and
investments, that could &#8220;challenge Goldman&#8217;s current business
model.&#8221; 
&#8220;Absent serious negative legal results, Fitch does not
envision any adverse outcome that would precipitate a downgrade
to Goldman&#8217;s IDR below the &#8216;A&#8217; rating category,&#8221; the statement
said. 
Fitch Ratings is one of the three biggest credit rating
companies. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Goldman Sachs at A1
-- the fifth highest rating -- with a negative outlook, while
Standard  Poor&#8217;s rates Goldman Sachs A -- the sixth-highest
level -- with a negative outlook. 
Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 60 cents to $150.05 as of
11:30 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock is down about 18 percent since April 15, the day before
the SEC filed suit.

Microsoft Corp. is finding some
software pirates remain &#8220;one step ahead&#8221; of its efforts to
clamp down on fake or corrupted programs, the company&#8217;s anti-
piracy enforcement chief said. 
The world&#8217;s largest software producer&#8217;s anti-piracy efforts
are hampered by programs that are difficult to distinguish from
genuine products, David Finn, associate general counsel for
anti-piracy, said by phone. That problem may be exacerbated by
the spread of cloud computing, whereby programs are hosted on
the Web rather than on users&#8217; hard drives, he said. 
The monetary value of unlicensed software worldwide grew by
5 percent to $50.2 billion in 2008, with the most widespread
piracy in countries including Armenia, Bangladesh, and Georgia,
according to data from Interactive Data Corp. and the Business
Software Alliance. Increases in theft are being driven by faster
growth of software in high-piracy emerging markets, they said. 
While Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has succeeded in
combating some groups, &#8220;unfortunately some of the other gangs
are one step ahead of us,&#8221; Finn said. &#8220;As they get smarter and
as the ways of avoiding detection get more elaborate, we have to
raise our game.&#8221; 
Last year, Microsoft joined software companies including
Symantec Corp. in asking the U.S. government to demand that
China curb software piracy. In 2006, the Chinese government
pledged to ensure that all government computers used only
genuine software, a promise the companies said had not yielded
many results. 
The rising popularity of cloud services will &#8220;make our job
tougher&#8221; as more programs are hosted and used exclusively
online, Finn said. Microsoft is competing with rivals including
Google Inc. to offer Internet-based email, word processing and
calendar software.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley are among 20 financial companies competing to manage
Coal India Ltd.&#8217;s initial public offering, in what may be the
nation&#8217;s largest first-time stock sale. 
Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Citigroup Inc. are also seeking the mandate, according to a
statement on the department of disinvestment&#8217;s website. Coal
India, the nation&#8217;s state-owned monopoly producer, may raise as
much as 130 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) in July, two
government officials said April 20. 
Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s second-biggest share sale
arranger, is competing for its first assignment managing a state
offering in India after the government said it will pay higher
fees. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government aims to raise
$9 billion in the year ending March 31 selling stock in one
company almost every month. 
&#8220;This deal is the one to be on if you want to make a
statement in Indian investment banking circles,&#8221; said
Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of equity at SMC Capitals Ltd. in
New Delhi. The amount Coal India aims to raise is &#8220;large and it
is expected to be a historic public issue for India.&#8221; 
Coal India&#8217;s IPO would surpass Reliance Power Ltd.&#8217;s 115.6
billion rupee offering in January 2008 as India&#8217;s biggest,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Sensex Surge 
The government said in January it may sell shares in 60
companies to shrink its budget deficit, after the key Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange jumped 81 percent in 2009,
the most in 18 years. 
Nomura Holdings Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, DSP Merrill Lynch
 Co, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities India Pvt. are
also scheduled to make presentations to the department today and
tomorrow, according to the statement. 
Enam Securities Pvt., India Infoline Ltd., IDFC Capital
Ltd., JM Financial Ltd., ICICI Securities Ltd., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. Ltd., Avendus Capital Pvt., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. are also competing. 
SJVN Ltd., the operator of India&#8217;s largest hydropower plant,
was the first IPO this fiscal year for the government. SJVN&#8217;s
sale was nine times oversubscribed in the institutional part and
three times in the retail portion, bringing &#8220;life back to
public sector issuances,&#8221; Thunuguntla said. It closed May 3. 
The government plans to appoint as many as six book-running
lead managers for Coal India&#8217;s IPO, it said in the release. Iron
ore miner NMDC Ltd., which raised 99.6 billion rupees in the
largest state share sale in 2010 so far, had six book runners.

Morgan Keegan  Co., the 26th-largest
underwriter of U.S. bonds, must repay an investor $1.12 million
plus $153,000 in attorney&#8217;s fees for auction-rate securities
bought in connection with a Jefferson County, Alabama, sewer
project, an arbitration panel ruled. 
The May 4 decision by a Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority panel in Atlanta resolves the first case to test
Morgan Keegan&#8217;s contention it shouldn&#8217;t have to repurchase
auction-rate securities connected with the Alabama deal, said
Kathy Ridley, a spokeswoman for the company. The project has
been tainted by the corruption conviction of Larry Langford, the
former Democratic chairman of the County Commission. 
Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan has yet to buy back
$165 million of auction-rate securities held by its clients,
including $50 million connected with Jefferson County, Ridley
said in a telephone interview today. 
The company&#8217;s clients held as much as $2.2 billion of the
bonds at one point, most of which was either redeemed by the
issuers or repurchased by Morgan Keegan. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Morgan Keegan
in July, alleging the closely held company didn&#8217;t tell customers
about growing risks in the auction-rate market from Nov. 1,
2007, to March 20, 2008, when it sold $1.2 billion worth of the
securities. The instruments became inaccessible when the $330
billion market collapsed in February 2008. That case is still
pending, Ridley said. 
Bond Refinancing 
Auction-rate securities were marketed as a near-cash
alternative that could be liquidated at sales typically held
every seven, 14 or 35 days. The market froze in 2008 when banks
that sold the securities stopped serving as buyers of last
resort at the auctions, causing the transactions to fail. 
A $3 billion refinancing of the sewer debt led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. in 2002 and 2003 nearly bankrupted the county during
the credit crisis. Officials had sought to lower borrowing costs
by issuing floating-rate bonds and entering into swaps through
which the county would pay a fixed rate in exchange for a
variable rate meant to cover the bonds. The financing fell apart
when the companies guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit
ratings, causing the interest rates on the debt to soar. 
&#8220;While we agree whole-heartedly that investors should
recover their lost investments in the auction-rate securities
issued by Jefferson County, Alabama, we strongly believe that
the burden of recovery appropriately lies with the underwriters
of these failed securities, namely JPMorgan, not Morgan
Keegan,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s press release states. 
Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment.

Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. may be
undervalued as U.S. Senate Democrats struggle to muster votes
for legislation to help merchants cut credit-card fees, Morgan
Stanley analyst Adam Frisch said. 
&#8220;The severity of the language in the proposed amendments,
in their current form, increases the potential for a 60-vote
approval requirement,&#8221; Frisch wrote today in a note to clients
before the companies&#8217; shares fell the most since October 2008.
&#8220;We would be buyers on weakness.&#8221; 
Three proposals by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of
Illinois could threaten more than $40 billion a year in
interchange or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees collected by card-issuing banks
including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. MasterCard and
San Francisco-based Visa set the rates. 
Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard fell yesterday
and today after Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, backed an amendment to the
financial industry overhaul bill that would let merchants offer
discounts for cash or a particular card brand, and allow
retailers to set maximum or minimum transaction amounts. 
MasterCard fell 3.2 percent to $230.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares tumbled as
much as 11 percent today when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged the most since 1987, before paring losses. Visa declined
4.1 percent to $82.92 after dropping as much as 12 percent. 
Earnings Surge 
MasterCard also declined as the euro slumped against the
dollar. Europe is MasterCard&#8217;s biggest market outside the U.S.
and the firm may face more competition there as banks plan to
create a rival payments network. Visa doesn&#8217;t process European
card transactions as that role is filled by London-based Visa
Europe Ltd., a separate company. 
In the past week, Visa Inc. and MasterCard said net income
surged in the quarter ended March 31 amid a rebound in card
spending and as more consumers worldwide switch from cash and
checks to plastic. Net income at MasterCard climbed 24 percent
to $455 million, while Visa&#8217;s increased 33 percent to $713
million. Both companies&#8217; results exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. 
&#8220;There has been very little, if anything, in Visa&#8217;s and
MasterCard&#8217;s results to justify the selloff,&#8221; Frisch said. 
The other amendments from Durbin would limit the amount
payment networks can charge for debit-card transactions and
mandate that the government receive the lowest interchange
rates, which average about 2 percent per transaction. Durbin has
said the U.S. is &#8220;a major user&#8221; of credit cards. 
Letter to Senators 
&#8220;There should be a fee associated with the use of credit
cards, but it has reached a point now of unreasonableness,&#8221;
Durbin said yesterday during debate on the overhaul bill. 
Merchants including convenience-store chain 7-Eleven Inc.
have complained to Congress that they are powerless to bargain
with Visa and MasterCard, calling them a duopoly. Finance-
industry groups including the Electronic Payments Coalition and
the American Bankers Association oppose Durbin&#8217;s proposals,
saying the measures would harm consumers, small businesses and
the economy. 
&#8220;Such amendments amount to express government price
setting of business-to-business transactions and would hurt the
ability of local banks to serve their communities,&#8221; the Bankers
Association said today in a letter to senators. &#8220;These
amendments would harm consumers by driving up the cost of credit
and by limiting the benefits consumers have come to expect.&#8221; 
Some state governments have crafted their own rules. 
Vermont&#8217;s senate unanimously approved a bill May 4 to let
merchants decline credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer
discounts for cash or other card brands. Republican Governor Jim Douglas hasn&#8217;t decided whether to veto the legislation, said his
spokesman, David Coriell. 
&#8220;He does have some concerns,&#8221; Coriell said yesterday.
&#8220;You certainly don&#8217;t want to discourage people in any way from
coming to the Green Mountains and going on a ski vacation
because we&#8217;ve passed some regulation that makes it harder for
them to spend their money.&#8221;

Rajat Gupta, the Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. director who is being investigated by U.S. authorities over
his links to Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam, had a
long-standing business relationship with the billionaire hedge
fund manager. 
Interviews, public records, lawsuits and regulatory filings
show a 13-year history of co-investing and other business
collaborations between Gupta, 61, the former worldwide head of
consulting firm McKinsey  Co., and Rajaratnam, 52, the central
figure in the Galleon insider trading probe. 
Rajaratnam has a stake in a fund managed by New Silk Route
NSR Partners LLC, founded by Gupta and three others in 2006 to
invest in South Asian companies, according to a New Silk Route
spokeswoman. The fund owns stakes in at least 11 Indian
companies, including cell phone tower operator Reliance Infratel
Ltd. and the Cafe Coffee Day chain. 
&#8220;Mr. Rajaratnam has had a well-known relationship with Mr.
Gupta for many years, and it is one that he is both proud and
fond of,&#8221; Rajaratnam&#8217;s spokesman, Jim McCarthy, said yesterday
in a statement. &#8220;Their association as investors has led to many
successful ventures around the world and made a large and
positive impact for a long list of worthy businesses and
charities. But just as important, they have always conducted
those efforts with integrity and diligent attention to sound,
ethical practices.&#8221;

James Glassman, a senior economist at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., said it was a mistake for him to call
members of a Senate panel ignorant and to call for &#8220;grownups to
step in&#8221; to the financial reform debate. 
&#8220;It was a stupid thing to do,&#8221; Glassman said today in an
interview after the New York-based bank apologized for his
remarks yesterday. &#8220;I fell into the same trap of getting
emotional about these issues, when what I meant by saying &#8216;the
grownups need to step in&#8217; was that we all need to cool down and
find some common ground.&#8221; 
Glassman, in a May 3 note to clients, criticized the &#8220;low
level of economic literacy&#8221; shown as the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current
and former executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on April 27.
The Senate is debating legislation aimed at restructuring
financial-system oversight to head off a future crisis,
including regulation of derivatives that could eliminate
billions of dollars of revenue from Wall Street firms. 
&#8220;There are political pressures on the bank that limit what
it can say about Congress,&#8221; said Richard Bove, a bank analyst
with Rochdale Securities who left Ladenburg Thalmann Financial
Services Inc. last year after a disagreement over settling a
defamation lawsuit against him. &#8220;There are significant
limitations on the freedom given to analysts to express their
opinions.&#8221; 
GOP Amendment 
Republicans filed an amendment today to remove language
from the bill that would require banks such as JPMorgan to wall
off their swaps-trading operations. Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told analysts last month that the bill would cost
the firm anywhere from &#8220;several hundred million to a couple
billion dollars.&#8221; 
President Barack Obama&#8217;s senior adviser, David Axelrod, and
National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers met with
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Dimon, and about 13 other
executives on April 6 in Washington and pressed them to stop
lobbying against the financial reform bill, people who attended
the meeting said last month. 
JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4
statement that Glassman&#8217;s report &#8220;is from a single economist
and does not reflect the views of our firm. 
&#8220;We disagree with his characterizations, and we&#8217;re
sorry,&#8221; Zuccarelli said in the statement. 
&#8216;Public Face&#8217; 
Glassman, 63, said economists are often &#8220;the public face
of a company,&#8221; even though he doesn&#8217;t speak for the bank.
&#8220;They were right to distance from this and to issue an
apology,&#8221; he said. 
Analysts&#8217; controversial views have created problems for
their employers in the past. 
Bove was sued in July 2008 by BankAtlantic Bancorp, which
said he defamed the company by saying it might fail in a report
titled &#8220;Who is Next?&#8221; Bove said at the time that he left
Ladenburg because it was moving to settle the suit while Bove
thought it had no merit. The case is still outstanding. 
In 1990, analyst Marvin Roffman was fired by Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. after he expressed doubts about the future
of Donald Trump&#8217;s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, prompting
Trump to threaten a lawsuit. The Taj Mahal project was forced
into bankruptcy months after Roffman&#8217;s comments. 
Glassman said he has received positive responses from
colleagues in the financial industry to his note, which he said
reflects the frustration felt as Wall Street is criticized by
politicians and pundits for the housing collapse and financial
crisis. 
&#8216;Singled Out&#8217; 
&#8220;I understand the outrage and I understand why many people
in the industry feel we&#8217;re being unfairly singled out when there
is plenty of blame to go around,&#8221; Glassman said. &#8220;But Wall
Street was a part of the problem and bears some blame, and there
are things that need to be fixed.&#8221; 
Glassman said in the research note that the &#8220;ignorance&#8221;
shown by senators in the Goldman Sachs hearing is also plaguing
reform efforts. The present form of the legislation does little
to resolve the issue of banks being &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; and
rather focuses on issues that didn&#8217;t cause the crisis, he said
in the note. 
&#8220;The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while,&#8221; Glassman wrote in the note. &#8220;Now that the financial
reform debate is in the final innings, it&#8217;s time for the
grownups to step in.&#8221; 
Munger Impressed 
Not everyone shared Glassman&#8217;s view of the proceedings.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charles Munger said in an
interview on May 3 that he was impressed with the senators&#8217;
understanding of the issues involved. 
&#8220;I thought they were the best I&#8217;d ever seen under such
circumstances in my history of watching senators,&#8221; Munger said.
&#8220;I thought it was an unusually intelligent and aggressive bunch
of people.&#8221; 
In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan and included a graph depicting the
state&#8217;s employment decline since 2000 compared with that of
other states, which was titled &#8220;People who live in glass houses
shouldn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221; Levin, a Democrat who was not named in
the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. 
Glassman said today the note was &#8220;unfair&#8221; to the senators
and said his main concern is the unintended consequences that
could arise from quickly pushing a financial reform bill through
Congress. 
Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said yesterday the
lawmaker didn&#8217;t plan to issue a statement. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment yesterday.

General Motors Co. notes, the most
actively traded U.S. corporate bonds today, fell as investors
sell riskier credit amid concerns that Europe&#8217;s financial crisis
may broaden. 
The company&#8217;s defaulted 8.375 percent securities due in
2033 declined 1.75 cent to 33.25 cents on the dollar as of 11:19
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Detroit-
based GM restructured in bankruptcy last year. 
The automaker&#8217;s debt has fallen amid &#8220;a broad pullback
across the distressed market,&#8221; said Timothy Daileader, director
of research at Knight Capital Group Inc. in Greenwich,
Connecticut. High-yield bond spreads rose 23 basis points
relative to similar-maturity Treasuries yesterday, the most
since June 2009, to 591 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. 
GM bonds &#8220;are an easy sell for distressed accounts to
raise liquidity,&#8221; Daileader said. Those investors &#8220;have been
buyers of European bank paper, and that is directly affected by
the pullback in Europe.&#8221; 
High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. Distressed
companies are those in default or with yield spreads of more
than 10 percentage points, or 1,000 basis points.

A Pfizer Inc. unit won a re-trial of a
Pennsylvania lawsuit over its menopause drugs that ended in a
first jury&#8217;s award of $1.5 million in damages, the company said. 
A Philadelphia judge yesterday ruled lawyers for the
plaintiff, Merle Simon, must ask another jury to consider
whether Pfizer&#8217;s Pharmacia  Upjohn subsidiary hid the health
risks of its Provera hormone-replacement drug. In December, an
appeals court reinstated Simon&#8217;s original verdict after it was
thrown out by the trial court, giving the judge the option of
ordering a new trial. 
&#8220;We anticipate we have a good opportunity to win another
verdict on behalf of Mrs. Simon,&#8221; Jim Morris, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;We
intend to push forward with this case until justice is served.&#8221; 
More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats, and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by Upjohn. 
Wyeth later combined the two hormones in Prempro. The drugs
are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
in October. 
&#8216;Appropriate&#8217; New Trial 
 &#8220;We are pleased with the judge&#8217;s ruling as we believe a new
trial is appropriate given the facts of this case,&#8221; Chris Loder, Pfizer&#8217;s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today. 
A three-judge Superior Court panel on Dec. 31 found state
Judge Nitza Quinones Alejandro erred in finding Simon&#8217;s claims
were barred by Pennsylvania&#8217;s statute of limitations on
lawsuits. 
The panel noted it was &#8220;entirely unreasonable&#8221; to assume
women knew the links between hormone-replacement drugs and
breast cancer until the 2002 Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, made it
clear. The study found that women using menopause medicines have
a higher risk of breast cancer. 
The panel sent the case back to Alejandro so she could
decide whether Pfizer was entitled to a new trial, and in the
meantime, ordered the jury verdict reinstated, according to the
38-page ruling. 
The appeals court still must rule on whether to accept
Alejandro&#8217;s decision on the new trial. 
Morris said a new trial would reinstate Wyeth as a
defendant in the case. Jurors in the original case rejected
Simon&#8217;s claims that Wyeth&#8217;s menopause medicine was also a cause
of her breast cancer. 
The case is Simon v. Wyeth, 040604229, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia).

Electric vehicle makers Coda
Automotive Inc. and Fisker Automotive Inc. led a 68 percent
increase in venture capital investments in the clean technology
sector in the first quarter, according to Ernst  Young LLP. 
Venture capital firms invested $733.3 million in clean
technology companies during 72 financing rounds, outpacing the
11 percent gain in among all industries. Almost half went to
early stage financings, the biggest share for seed and first-
stage technology investments since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
&#8220;People are becoming more confident investing in new
technologies,&#8221; said Gil Forer, head of global clean technology
for Ernst  Young, which analyzed data compiled by Dow Jones
VentureSource. &#8220;The electrification of transportation is a huge
opportunity.&#8221; 
Coda Automotive, a Santa Monica, California-based
manufacturer of electric cars, received $100 million in funding
during the quarter to improve batteries and deliver the first
model to the U.S. this year. 
Fisker took in $93 million of venture capital, and last
month won a $528.7 million U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee
to manufacture a plug-in hybrid at a factory in Wilmington,
Delaware. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a significant amount of money moving into
cleantech this year from both government stimulus and private
capital firms,&#8221; Forer said yesterday in an interview. 
Solar manufacturer Solyndra Inc., based in Fremont,
California, received the most venture funds last year with $198
million, followed by $100 million each for car battery maker
A123 Systems Inc. and smart grid developers Silver Spring
Networks and Landis+Gyr AG.

Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Co.,
the drugmaker controlled by China&#8217;s wealthiest couple, jumped in
its trading debut, giving Goldman Sachs Group Inc. a 235-fold
paper return on its investment in the company. 
Hepalink, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the blood-thinner
heparin, climbed to 175.17 yuan on the Shenzhen stock exchange
from its initial public offer price of 148 yuan. Today&#8217;s 18
percent gain values Goldman&#8217;s stake, bought for $4.9 million in
2007, at more than $1 billion. 
The IPO price was the highest by any company in China,
helping Hepalink raise 5.9 billion yuan ($864 million) to expand
production capacity to supply clients including Paris-based
Sanofi-Aventis SA. The stock was one of three that started
trading in China today, with Shanghai Communications Technology
Development Co. surging 70 percent. 
Hepalink&#8217;s &#8220;IPO price is too high and its performance won&#8217;t
be good after the debut,&#8221; said Zhang Kun, a strategist at
Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai. &#8220;The IPO shares were
priced at a time when investors ramped up small-cap stocks on

The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China&#8217;s stock exchanges, fell 4.1 percent and the CSI 300 Index
declined 3.4 percent.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying the Mexican peso against the dollar, saying strengthening
growth in the Latin American country&#8217;s economy will help the
currency recover after an &#8220;irrational&#8221; sell-off. 
The peso added 0.7 percent to 12.9002 at 3:40 p.m. New York
time today and will advance 5.7 percent to 12.2 per dollar,
Fiona Lake, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note today.
The peso has dropped 4.6 percent versus the dollar this week,
its biggest decline since November 2008, on concern the European
debt crisis will derail the global economic rebound. 
&#8220;The global macro picture remains extremely supportive of
a clear pro-cyclical stance,&#8221; Lake said. &#8220;Markets have
displayed a certain degree of irrational behavior in recent
days, which suggests the related price action may have overshot.
The peso outlook has improved very significantly as growth has
strengthened rapidly.&#8221; 
Before this week&#8217;s decline, the peso had risen 6.3 percent
this year against the dollar, the best performance among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as the recovery in the
U.S., Mexico&#8217;s largest trading partner, boosted its exports.
Reports showed today that U.S. payrolls surged by the most in
four years in April, while German industrial production rose
more than economists forecast in March. 
&#8220;Mexico is well placed to benefit from the improving
growth outlook in the U.S.,&#8221; Lake said. 
Central banks have more tools to provide &#8220;liquidity&#8221; to
financial institutions than in 2008 and some reports of
&#8220;sovereign contagion risks&#8221; in Europe have been overstated,
Lake said. 
Investors should exit the trade if the peso declines to
13.2 per dollar, according to the note.

&#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; may top $400 million in
domestic ticket sales, kicking off what is likely to be a record
summer for Hollywood studios, analysts said. 
The film, made by Walt Disney Co&#8217;s Marvel Entertainment and
distributed by Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount Pictures, opens in
theaters today and is projected to take in as much as $155
million this weekend in the U.S. and Canada, according to
Jeffrey Hartke, an analyst with Hollywood Stock Exchange.com. 
Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer&#8217;s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com&#8217;s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely going to have a record,&#8221; Dergarabedian
said in an interview. 
As of May 3, year-to-date receipts totaled $3.36 billion in
U.S. and Canadian theaters, up 6.3 percent from $3.25 billion a
year ago, according to Hollywood.com. 
Studios are scheduled to release seven three-dimensional
films this summer, including Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; on June 18
and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc&#8217;s &#8220;Shrek Forever After&#8221; on
May 21. The average ticket price for 3-D and 2-D movies combined
in the U.S. and Canada is about $7.95, up from $7.45 last
summer, according to Hollywood.com. 
&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; which was not filmed in 3-D, features
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who dons an armored, jet-
powered suit. Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson co-star. 
&#8216;Twilight: Eclipse&#8217; 
The original film, released in 2008, generated worldwide
ticket sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; has taken in $132.9 million since its
release last week outside the U.S. The movie may reach $400
million in domestic sales, Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with
Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in a May 3 note. 
Other films likely to generate significant sales this
summer include Summit Entertainment LLC&#8217;s &#8220;The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse,&#8221; the third film in the series based on the novels by
Stephenie Meyer, Dergarabedian said. The first two movies,
starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, have had
worldwide sales of $1.1 billion, according to Box Office Mojo.

General Growth Properties Inc.&#8217;s board
backed the latest financing proposal from a group led by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in court, rejecting Simon
Property Group Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;best and final&#8221; offer. General Growth
fell as much as 13 percent in New York trading. 
The Brookfield-led plan is better than Simon&#8217;s, General
Growth President Thomas Nolan said in testimony read in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today. Lawyers for Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, said the company will withdraw from
bidding if U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper approves the
Brookfield plan, partly because the stock warrants that
accompany it would make Simon&#8217;s buyout more expensive. 
Under the revision introduced today, Brookfield&#8217;s
investment partner Pershing Square Capital Management LP would
forgo any warrants until General Growth&#8217;s reorganization is
complete, and Toronto-based Brookfield would increase the strike
price on its warrants to $10.75 from $10.50, General Growth
lawyer Marcia Goldstein told Gropper. Another partner, Fairholme
Capital Management LLC, also would get warrants. 
The hearing comes a day after Indianapolis-based Simon
stepped up its three-month quest to acquire General Growth by
making a $6.5 billion bid for the Chicago-based company.
Brookfield&#8217;s rival proposal would leave General Growth an
independent company. 
$20 a Share 
Simon&#8217;s offer is valued at $20 a share, the company said
yesterday in a statement. It consists of $5 in cash, $10 in
shares of Simon stock and the distribution of shares in a new
company, General Growth Opportunities, valued at $5. 
General Growth fell $1.24, or 7.8 percent, to $14.60 at
1:59 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares earlier
traded as low as $13.86. 
&#8220;These offers are best and final,&#8221; Simon Chief Executive
Officer David Simon said in a letter to General Growth&#8217;s board.
Simon &#8220;will not participate in the bidding process in the GGP
bankruptcy proceeding in any way once GGP commits to issue the
warrants associated with the latest Brookfield-sponsored plan.&#8221; 
Pershing Square&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer William Ackman
responded today with a letter to the General Growth board
offering to forgo 17 million interim warrants. Ackman made the
offer in an effort to push through Brookfield&#8217;s plan, saying
Simon&#8217;s bid posed antitrust risks because it would link the
nation&#8217;s two largest mall owners. 
Simon estimates the warrants could cost General Growth
shareholders $895 million. Ronen Bojmel, a managing director at
General Growth&#8217;s financial adviser Miller Buckfire  Co.,
testified today that they would be worth about $688 million. 
Unsecured Debt 
Simon&#8217;s original bid on Feb. 16 would have given General
Growth stockholders $9 a share, including $6 in cash. That was
turned down as too low. Both that plan and the new one pay all
General Growth unsecured creditors, who hold about $7 billion in
debt, in full. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

said today in a court hearing. 
General Growth&#8217;s plan to give Brookfield, Fairholme Capital
Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LP
warrants to buy stock in the reorganized company in exchange for
funding has been changed so that Pershing will waive its share
of interim warrants, and Brookfield will increase the strike
price on its warrants to $10.75 from $10.50, Goldstein told U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan today.

The $3.1 billion merger of UAL Corp.&#8217;s
United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. was only the
year&#8217;s 38th-largest deal. That didn&#8217;t keep some of Wall Street&#8217;s
top rainmakers from getting involved. 
James B. Lee Jr., a vice chairman and veteran merger
adviser at JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
Michael Carr, a senior member of the firm&#8217;s merger leadership
group, advised UAL Chief Executive Officer Glenn Tilton. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Robert Kindler, head of global mergers and
acquisitions, worked with Continental, alongside Lazard Ltd.&#8217;s
Harry Pinson, a banker in the carrier&#8217;s home city of Houston. 
The merger, which creates the world&#8217;s biggest airline with
almost 86,000 employees, was the second effort in two years to
bring United and Continental to the altar. In April 2008, the
airlines were hours away from approving a deal when Continental
pulled out of talks and resolved to remain independent. 
&#8220;The deal executed last Sunday night was virtually the same
transaction we negotiated two years ago,&#8221; Lee said in an
interview with Charlie Rose published in Bloomberg
Businessweek&#8217;s May 10 issue. &#8220;The seeds were planted quite some
time ago.&#8221; 
United and Continental announced the merger on May 3 after
signing the deal the night before at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine  Moore LLP, United&#8217;s legal counsel. 
GE, PepsiCo 
JPMorgan&#8217;s team included Thomas Miles, Christopher Ventresca, co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions,
and David Fox, head of Midwest investment banking. Goldman&#8217;s
Patrick McClymont also advised Chicago-based United. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Nelson Walsh and Josh Connor were part of the group
advising Continental. 
The deal is the latest in a series of high-profile mandates
for Lee and Kindler. Lee, 57, a longtime adviser to UAL&#8217;s
Tilton, helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt holders. 
Kindler, 56, advised PepsiCo Inc.&#8217;s biggest bottler on its
sale to the soda and snack maker last year, and helped CF
Industries Holdings Inc. win a year-long battle to buy Terra
Industries Inc. Carr has been helping Airgas Inc. defend against
a hostile takeover bid from Air Products  Chemicals Inc. 
For legal advice, United is using Cravath&#8217;s Scott Barshay
and George Zobitz. Continental&#8217;s CEO Jeff Smisek is using the
law firm where he once worked, Vinson  Elkins, where Kevin Lewis is working on the deal. Jones Day&#8217;s Robert Profusek and
Mark Metts and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP are also
advising. 
There have been 32 airline deals so far this year, with a
total value of $7.7 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The largest was the $3.3 billion takeover of Japan
Airlines Corp. by Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of
Japan, the state-affiliated fund. 
Goldman Sachs is the biggest merger adviser this year,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan is third, and Morgan Stanley and
Lazard are fifth and sixth respectively.

&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; a sequel based on the
Marvel superhero comics, opened as the top movie in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, kicking off the summer film season with
$133.6 million for Walt Disney Co. and distributor Paramount
Pictures. 
The film posted the fifth-highest opening weekend gross
ever, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. 
The movie marks what is likely to be a record summer box-
office season for Hollywood, Hollywood.com said. The original
&#8220;Iron Man,&#8221; released in 2008, generated total worldwide ticket
sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. 
&#8220;It delivered on what it promised,&#8221; said Jeff Bock,
senior box-office analyst at Los Angeles-based Exhibitor
Relations Co. &#8220;The original film set the bar so high, but this
was on target with all expectations in what it offered.&#8221; 
In the sequel, Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, an
industrialist who dons a jet-powered, armored suit to fight
villains. 
The movie had $10.2 million in sales at Imax Corp.
theaters, a record for the company. 
Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; holds the record for
the highest grossing film with $158.4 million in its opening
weekend in July 2008. It went on to earn $533.3 million at the
domestic box office, Hollywood.com said. 
&#8216;Nightmare on Elm Street&#8217; 
Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer&#8217;s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com&#8217;s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. 
&#8220;A Nightmare on Elm Street&#8221; dropped to second place with
$9.2 million for Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s New Line studio. The film,
which features Jackie Earle Haley as serial-killer Freddy
Krueger, has taken in $48.5 million in two weeks. 
&#8220;How to Train Your Dragon,&#8221; from DreamWorks Animation SKG
Inc., dropped to third place from second with sales of $6.8
million. The film has made $201 million in six weeks of release. 
&#8220;Date Night,&#8221; a comedy starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell, fell to fourth place from third, taking in $5.3 million
for News Corp. 
&#8216;Robin Hood&#8217; 
&#8220;The Back-Up Plan,&#8221; from CBS Corp.&#8217;s film division,
dropped to fifth place from fourth with sales of $4.3 million.
The romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez, has made $29.4
million in three weeks. 
&#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; will debut next weekend and likely won&#8217;t
take the No. 1 spot from &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; Bock said. 
&#8220;It will be tough to beat &#8216;Iron Man,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only
&#8216;Shrek Forever After&#8217; and &#8216;Toy Story 3&#8217; may have a chance. Those
are probably the top three movies of the summer.&#8221; 
Sales for the top 12 films rose 21.9 percent to $173.9
million from $142.8 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said.
Year-to-date receipts total $3.66 billion, up 6.5 percent from
$3.43 billion. Attendance has fallen 0.08 percent this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, said a new tax on executive bonuses in the
U.K. will be &#8220;material,&#8221; without specifying how much it will
cost the company. 
&#8220;The impact of this legislation is in the process of being
quantified, and is expected to be material,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a
regulatory filing today. 
JPMorgan said the charge will appear in the second quarter,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., ranked
first and third in the U.S. by assets, said in separate filings
last week that they expect to pay $465 million and $400 million,
respectively. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has estimated the tax may
cost more than $600 million. 
U.K. officials, seeking to assuage public outrage over
bailout programs, imposed a one-time tax on bonuses of more than
25,000 pounds, or about $37,000 at current exchange rates. The
levy covers bonuses awarded between Dec. 9, 2009, and April 5.
George Osborne, the U.K. Conservative lawmaker in charge of the
party&#8217;s Treasury policy, said in January large cash bank bonuses
are unacceptable at a time when ordinary workers are struggling
to cope with the recession. 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank, said in a
filing last week that it will recognize a charge without saying
how much. 
The U.K. Treasury, which initially said the tax would raise
550 million pounds, has estimated it may net as much as 2
billion pounds, according to a government official who declined
to be identified. 
JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in U.S. aid last year,
remained profitable throughout the financial crisis, relying on
fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending and credit
cards.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche
Bank AG are in talks to provide about $2 billion of financing to
a group led by Centerbridge Partners LP and Paulson  Co. that
is bidding for bankrupt U.S. hotel chain Extended Stay Inc., two
people familiar with the situation said. 
The Centerbridge-Paulson led group, which also includes
Blackstone Group LP, has committed to invest up to $905.4
million into Extended Stay, trumping an early offer from a group
lead by Starwood Capital. A deal with the banks, which would be
backed by Extended Stay&#8217;s real estate, hasn&#8217;t been completed,
said the people, who declined to be named because the
negotiations are private. 
Extended Stay, which filed the largest bankruptcy case by a
U.S. hotel owner in June, withdrew its request for approval of
the Starwood proposal last month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are in talks to provide the Starwood-led group
with about $2.2 billion of financing, a person familiar with the
situation said. 
At an April 8 hearing, Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for
Extended Stay at Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP in New York, said
the company favored the Centerbridge-Paulson offer over
Starwood&#8217;s. Under the terms, the hotelier can seek better deals,
and an auction is planned for May 27, she said. 
Bundling Debt 
The banks plan on bundling the debt to be sold as bonds,
said the people. Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities
plummeted to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $232.4 billion
in 2007 as credit markets seized up, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Even with U.S. government aid, only $3.04 billion
of the bonds were sold last year, and a $309.7 million issue was
the only offering this year. 
David Lichtenstein&#8217;s Lightstone Group LLC bought Extended
Stay in 2007, relying on more than $7 billion in debt financing
to complete the $8 billion deal just weeks before the leveraged-
buyout market imploded. 
Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup
declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Starwood.
Representatives of Centerbridge, Paulson and Goldman Sachs
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The Centerbridge-Paulson offer includes $450 million in
cash, $200 million to backstop a rights offering and as much as
$255.4 million to creditors who elect to take cash at a 30
percent discount to the value of the stock the reorganization
plan otherwise would give them. 
May 17 Deadline 
The $450 million equity injection is for 43 percent of the
new company and the backstop represents another 19 percent. 
The deadline for proposals for investing in Extended Stay
is May 17. Starwood plans to bid for the hotel chain, Bruce Zirinsky, a lawyer for Starwood at Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York, said at an April 22 court hearing. 
Five Mile Capital Partners LLC, an alternative-investment
firm in Stamford, Connecticut, and TPG, a private-equity firm in
Fort Worth, Texas, are part of Starwood&#8217;s investment group. The
talks with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were previously reported
by the Wall Street Journal. 
The case is In re Extended Stay Inc. 09-13764, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s traders
made money every single day of the first quarter, a feat the
firm has never accomplished before. 
Daily trading net revenue was $25 million or higher in all
of the first quarter&#8217;s 63 trading days, New York-based Goldman
Sachs reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. The firm reaped more than $100 million on 35
of the days, or more than half the time. 
Goldman Sachs, which is facing a fraud lawsuit from the SEC
related to the sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
generated $9.74 billion in trading revenue in the first quarter,
exceeding all of its Wall Street competitors. Trading accounted
for 76 percent of first-quarter revenue. The lack of trading
losses could add to the perception that Goldman Sachs has an
unfair advantage in the markets, said one shareholder. 
&#8220;It will reinforce the heads we win, tails you lose
mentality that people think actually exists and promotes the
concept of an unfair advantage,&#8221; said Douglas Ciocca, a
managing director at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood,
Kansas, which oversees about $2 billion in assets including
Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s too politically charged not to, how
is that possible that they only make money?&#8221; 
Record Earnings 
The bank, which reported record earnings last year, is
contesting the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit and the firm&#8217;s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing last month.
Goldman Sachs, which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is
also being investigated by federal prosecutors, said people
familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;This is the first time we have reported zero trading loss
days in a quarter,&#8221; Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
said in an e-mail. &#8220;We believe it shows the strength of our
customer franchise and risk management.&#8221; 
Ciocca echoed that view, saying he thinks the performance
proves the strength of the firm&#8217;s risk-management models and its
ability to make money even in markets with low volatility. 
&#8220;The statistical probability of going through what we did
would never favor them making money every day,&#8221; Ciocca said.
&#8220;It actually speaks very well of their capability to manage
through different types of markets.&#8221; 
Reaching Out 
Ciocca said he&#8217;s had first-hand experience of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s efforts to reach out to clients in the wake of the SEC
lawsuit to answer questions about the matter. He said
representatives from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset-management division
contacted his firm during the last week of April even though
they hadn&#8217;t been in touch for a year before that. 
&#8220;It was tactical, it was appropriate, it wasn&#8217;t
patronizing, it was very sincere,&#8221; Ciocca said. 
In its SEC filing today, Goldman Sachs said it is expecting
further litigation related to sales of collateralized debt
obligations. 
&#8220;We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs,&#8221; the bank said. 
The company also laid out in the filing a worst-case
scenario of what could happen if the firm doesn&#8217;t resolve the
SEC case and can&#8217;t obtain appropriate waivers from relevant
regulators. 
Imposing Restrictions 
The results could include &#8220;an inability to act as a
registered broker-dealer or provide certain advisory and other
services to U.S. registered mutual funds,&#8221; the filing said.
&#8220;In addition, regulators could impose restrictions on the
activities of our banking, commodities, investment advisory or
other regulated businesses.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter earnings were the second-
highest in the company&#8217;s history. 
The firm&#8217;s stock dropped 22 percent from before the SEC
lawsuit was filed on April 16 through May 7, making it the worst
performer among the six largest U.S. banks so far in 2010. 
The shares rose 84 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $143.83 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, as global
stocks soared with the European loan program to end the
sovereign-debt crisis.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit filed by Jefferson County, Alabama, that
claims the bank enticed it into a risky refinancing of about $3
billion of sewer debt by making $8 million in payments to
friends of county officials. 
Circuit Judge Caryl Penney Privett in Birmingham rejected
the New York-based bank&#8217;s arguments that the county is barred by
the statue of limitations, a time limit for bringing action, and
its contention that the county failed to show that JPMorgan was
involved in a conspiracy, in a ruling issued May 7. 
Jefferson County, in the suit filed in November, alleged
fraud, conspiracy and &#8220;unjust enrichment against those who have
brought the county and its citizens to the brink of financial
disaster while lining their own pockets.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, advised
the state&#8217;s most populous county in 2002 and 2003 to enter into
a series of floating-rate bond and interest-rate swaps that
created an &#8220;inherently flawed financial structure that imploded
within just a few years,&#8221; according to the county&#8217;s complaint. 
Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
today. 
Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, also named in the
suit, were the managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan who
oversaw the sewer-debt transactions. LeCroy and MacFaddin are
accused of arranging $8.2 million in illegal payments to local
broker-dealers who were friends of county commissioners, in
exchange for the county&#8217;s business. 
Larry Langford, former mayor of Birmingham and president of
the county commission at the time of the debt refinancing, is
serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison in Kentucky for
accepting $241,000 in bribes from William Blount, of Montgomery
investment firm Blount Parrish  Co. Blount was paid $2.8
million by JPMorgan during the bond transactions. 
Bankruptcy Brink 
Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, has teetered on the
brink of bankruptcy after interest rates on $3.2 billion in
bonds soared in 2008, when companies that insured them lost
their credit ratings because of losses on unrelated mortgage-
backed securities. 
In November, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into derivative sales to the county. 
The bank paid $50 million outright to the county, and
agreed to cancel $647 million in fees the county faced to unwind
the transactions. JPMorgan, which also paid $25 million to be
placed in a fund to compensate affected investors, neither
admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

The zloty may gain 12 percent against
the dollar after European leaders unveiled a loan package to
contain Greece&#8217;s debt crisis, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., which advised investors to buy Poland&#8217;s currency. 
The zloty may appreciate to 2.8 per dollar compared with
3.1250 on 5:20 p.m. in Warsaw, the New York-based bank wrote in
a research note today. The euro may depreciate against the zloty
&#8220;back towards its April lows&#8221; as the aid package creates &#8220;a
solid backdrop for further recovery in risk sentiment,&#8221; it
wrote.

Japan, Australia, Brazil, China, China Economy, Country Economies, Currencies, Emerging Markets, India, Korea, Markets, Pacific Rim, Russia, Specialized Regions, Taiwan" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-10/morgan-stanley-says-china-pboc-has-changed-yuan-language-in-latest-report.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Says China PBOC Has Changed Yuan Language in Latest Report</headline><body>
Morgan Stanley said that China&#8217;s
central bank changed language relating to yuan policy in its
latest monetary policy report, signaling its intention to let
the yuan appreciate. 
Policy makers plan to further improve the managed float
exchange-rate regime and keep the currency broadly stable
&#8220;based on market demand and supply, and with reference to a
currency basket,&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China said in the
outlook section of a quarterly statement today. The previous
report called for improving policies in a &#8220;controllable&#8221; and
&#8220;gradual&#8221; manner. 
&#8220;The change is big, it&#8217;s huge,&#8221; said Wang Qing, chief
economist for Greater China in Hong Kong at Morgan Stanley.
&#8220;They haven&#8217;t used this language of saying the currency should
be determined on a currency basket, and determined by market
demand and supply and a managed-float exchange regime. This
language has been missing for many reports.&#8221; 
China halted the currency&#8217;s 21 percent, three-year advance
against the dollar in July 2008 to help exporters weather
recessions in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Officially its
exchange-rate regime still involves managing the exchange rate
against a basket of currencies including the euro and the
Japanese yen. 
Export Gain 
Before the statement, yuan forwards strengthened the most
this year after China reported a pickup in exports, fanning
optimism policy makers will let the currency appreciate.
Exports rose 30.5 percent in April from a year earlier, the
customs bureau said today, exceeding the previous month&#8217;s 24.3
percent gain and the 28.9 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. 
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.5 percent
to 6.6778 per dollar as of 5:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 2.2 percent from the spot
rate of 6.8265, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s
the biggest increase since Dec. 22. 
The yuan&#8217;s 12-month forwards also climbed after European
Union finance ministers announced an aid package worth as much
as 750 billion euros ($962 billion). Interest-rate swaps
increased before inflation data is released tomorrow. 
China had a trade surplus of $1.68 billion last month, the
customs bureau said, compared with a deficit of $7.24 billion
in March. Economists forecast a shortfall of $550 million,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. 
Banks have interpreted shifts in language before only to
be proved wrong. The central bank scrapped the pledge to keep
the yuan &#8220;basically stable&#8221; in its quarterly monetary policy
report on Nov. 11. Subsequent reports included the language
again.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, is expecting further litigation related to sales of
collateralized debt obligations. 
&#8220;We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs,&#8221; the New York-
based company said in a quarterly filing with the SEC today. 
The bank, which reported record earnings last year, was hit
by a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission last month and the bank&#8217;s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing. Goldman Sachs,
which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is also being
investigated by federal prosecutors, said people familiar with
the matter. 
The company received letters from shareholders &#8220;demanding
the board take action to address alleged misconduct&#8221; by Goldman
Sachs and certain officers and employees, it said in the filing.
The demands are in connection with the 2007 CDO transaction at
the heart of the SEC case, Goldman said. 
Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from trading than any
other Wall Street firm, also disclosed that its traders
generated $100 million or more on 35 days during the first
quarter and lost money on no days. The firm set a record when it
made $100 million or more on 46 days in the second quarter.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may say first-quarter profit surged on
lower writedowns and higher life premiums. 
Net income will probably increase to 477 million euros
($622 million) from 104 million euros a year earlier, according
to the median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 412 million euros to 555 million euros. 
&#8220;Life insurance continues to benefit from a supportive
environment for traditional business,&#8221; Niccolo Dalla Palma, an
analyst at Exane BNP Paribas with a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation
on the stock, wrote in a May 6 report. &#8220;All of the growth
in group premiums is likely to be driven by this line
of business.&#8221; 
Cesare Geronzi, appointed Generali&#8217;s new chairman last
month, wants to boost growth outside Italy. The insurer is
already expanding in emerging markets, including China and the
Middle East, and in eastern Europe as it seeks to recover from
the global financial crisis. 
Analysts including Ralph Hebgen at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Ltd. expect non-life business to be affected by claims related
to winter storm Xinthia, which Generali estimated to fall within
a range of 60 million euros to 80 million euros. Life premiums
are expected to rise 19 percent to more than 14 billion euros. 
The insurer is due to report earnings on May 12 at about
1 p.m. local time and to hold a conference call at 2:30 p.m.
the same day. Following is a table of the analysts&#8217; estimates
and the year-earlier results. The figures are in millions of
euros, except the combined ratio.

Copper is looking &#8220;attractive&#8221;
after the recent selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;Copper fundamentals, which have begun to tighten, will
likely continue to do so as developed markets demand continues
to improve against slowing but still robust emerging markets
demand,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed report. 
Copper will be the first of the metals to hit supply
constraints on a sustained basis, the bank&#8217;s analysts including
Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. 
The metal had its worst week in three months last week on
concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may derail the global economic
recovery. Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.2 percent to $7,100.75 a metric ton
today, after tumbling 6.5 percent last week. 
Copper prices more than doubled last year as government
stimulus packages, including China&#8217;s $586 billion program, drove
demand. Copper has fallen 4.1 percent this year on concern that
China&#8217;s measures to rein in lending and curb property
speculation will curb demand for the metal used in construction
and automobiles. 
The fundamentals for zinc are expected to &#8220;tighten
meaningfully&#8221; in the next 12 to 24 months, &#8220;hastened by mine
retirements,&#8221; the analysts wrote. 
&#8220;These fundamental views suggest that price risk is skewed
to the upside for copper in the near-to-medium term and for zinc
in the medium-to-longer term, especially given the magnitude of
the recent pullback,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Consumers should view price
dips in these metals as buying opportunities, with recent price
action providing a compelling opportunity for copper in
particular.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying a basket of Asian currencies against the yen, saying
there is &#8220;little obvious contagion&#8221; risk from Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis. 
The bank especially recommended the Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah because of &#8220;strong growth,
solid external balances and declining risk aversion,&#8221; according
to a research note today written by analysts including Fiona
Lake and Mark Tan. All 10 Asian emerging-market currencies
gained today versus the yen after the European Union unveiled an
unprecedented loan package to stop Greece&#8217;s fiscal woes from
spreading. 
&#8220;Given that European policy makers have now announced a
credible package to shore up the system in euroland, we expect
the market to turn its attention to trading the macro data,&#8221;
the report said. &#8220;The macro backdrop in Malaysia, Philippines
and Indonesia remains strong.&#8221; 
The ringgit led gains in Asian currencies versus the yen
this year, climbing 7.1 percent, followed by the rupiah with a
3.6 percent advance. The peso has climbed 2.2 percent against
the yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Goldman Sachs targets a basket of currencies including the
ringgit, peso and the rupiah to rise 6 percent against the yen,
without specifying a time frame. It recommended limiting losses
on the trade after a 2 percent decline. 
Regional Growth 
Indonesia&#8217;s economy grew at the fastest pace in more than a
year last quarter, expanding 5.7 percent from a year earlier,
the Central Statistics Office said today. Malaysia&#8217;s gross
domestic product probably expanded 9.3 percent in the first
three months from a year earlier, after growing 4.5 percent the
previous quarter, a government report on May 13 may show,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. 
The yen fell against all 10 Asian major currencies today as
demand for high-yielding assets surged after the Bank of Japan
said central banks from the U.S., Japan and Europe will
participate in temporary U.S. dollar swap agreements to contain
the debt crisis. European Union finance ministers announced an
aid package worth as much as 750 billion euros ($962 billion),
according to Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado. 
The yen is a favorite currency for funding carry trades, in
which money borrowed in a nation with low interest rates is
invested in a country offering higher returns. The risk is that
currency moves erase those gains.

Four of the largest U.S. banks,
including Citigroup Inc., racked up perfect quarters in their
trading businesses between January and March, underscoring how
government support and less competition is fueling Wall Street&#8217;s
revival. 
Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the first, second and fifth-biggest U.S. banks
by assets, all said in regulatory filings that they had zero
days of trading losses in the first quarter. Citigroup Inc., the
third-largest, doesn&#8217;t break out its daily trading revenue by
quarter. It recorded a profit on each trading day, two people
with knowledge of the results said. 
&#8220;The trading profits of the Street is just another way of
measuring the subsidy the Fed is giving to the banks,&#8221; said
Christopher Whalen, managing director of Torrance, California-
based Institutional Risk Analytics. &#8220;It&#8217;s a transfer from
savers to banks.&#8221; 
The trading results, which helped the banks report higher
quarterly profit than analysts estimated even as unemployment
stagnated at a 27-year high, came with a big assist from the
Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank helped lenders by holding
short-term borrowing costs near zero, giving them a chance to
profit by carrying even 10-year government notes that yielded an
average of 3.70 percent last quarter.

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest
media company, said fiscal second-quarter profit climbed 55
percent on a rebound at the film studio. The shares fell after
the television units&#8217; profit missed some analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Programming costs rose at ESPN, which had a &#8220;mid-single-
digits&#8221; percentage increase in advertising sales, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today. The ABC broadcast network
was hampered by lower prime-time ratings and higher expenses. 
&#8220;The cable network margins were a little bit light of what
people were expecting,&#8221; said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen 
Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;Disney had talked about how they were
going to have sports programming-rights expenses, but I think
the magnitude of that caught some people by surprise.&#8221; 
Disney fell $1.20, or 3.4 percent, to $34.56 in extended
trading after the results were announced. The shares gained 47
cents to $35.76 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and have increased 11 percent this year. 
Net income rose to $953 million, or 48 cents a share, from
$613 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, Disney said in a
statement. That beat the 46-cent average of 22 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period ended April
3 gained 6.1 percent to $8.58 billion after the January takeover
of Marvel Entertainment. Analysts expected $8.42 billion. 
Bookings Drop 
Hotel reservations at the theme parks are pacing down 10
percent in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call after the results. The company
is using fewer discounts to lure visitors to parks near Orlando,
Florida, and in Anaheim, California. 
&#8220;To the extent that they had a beat in the quarter it was
driven by film. I think people would rather have seen it
driven by cable and parks,&#8221; Creutz, who rates the shares
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; said in an interview. 
Profit in the cable division led by ESPN totaled $1.18
billion, short of the $1.21 billion estimate of Imran Khan, an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. who has a neutral rating on the
stock. Revenue in the division, including the Disney Channel,
gained 9.4 percent to $2.41 billion, led by increases in
affiliate fees, the company said. 
Ad Revenue 
ESPN&#8217;s ad revenue was up by a &#8220;mid-single-digits&#8221;
percentage in the quarter, Rasulo said. 
Discovery Communications Inc., the owner of Animal Planet,
reported a 9 percent gain in U.S. cable ad revenue last week.
Time Warner Inc., the owner of CNN and TBS, said cable ad sales
gained 9 percent. 
&#8220;Sometimes some of the numbers we see out there are not
apples-to-apples across different companies,&#8221; Rasulo said. He
said Disney reports ad revenue that includes cash sales and
make-goods. 
Profit in Disney&#8217;s broadcast division, including ABC, fell
24 percent to $123 million, while revenue gained 1.1 percent to
$1.43 billion. Khan had expected profit of $170.1 million. 
In the current quarter, prices for commercials on ABC sold
close to air date are up 30 percent from spots sold last year in
advance of the current TV season, Disney said. Ad sales at ESPN
and the TV stations are pacing up by &#8220;double digits&#8221; compared
with a year ago, Rasulo said. 
ESPN Ad Sales 
Worldwide ticket sales of $960.4 million for the 3-D
&#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; revived Disney&#8217;s film profit. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger named Rich Ross, former head of
the Disney Channel, to lead the studio in October and completed
the $4.2 billion purchase of Marvel, maker of &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; in
January. 
Led by &#8220;Alice,&#8221; which was shown in three-dimensional and
standard format, the studio reported a profit of $223 million,
compared with $13 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 7
percent to $1.54 billion from $1.44 billion a year earlier, when
Disney&#8217;s films included &#8220;Race to Witch Mountain&#8221; and
&#8220;Confessions of a Shopaholic.&#8221; 
&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; distributed by Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount, has
collected $323.4 million in global ticket sales as of May 9,
according to Box Office Mojo, a unit of Seattle-based Amazon.com
Inc. &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; from Disney&#8217;s Pixar studio, will be in
theaters on June 18. 
Profit from theme parks fell 12 percent to $150 million,
while revenue gained 1.7 percent to $2.45 billion as higher
guest spending countered a drop in attendance. Pension and
retiree medical costs rose.

Electrical Components International
Inc., a maker of wire harnesses for appliances, won court
approval of its restructuring plan, paving the way for the
company to exit bankruptcy after less than two months. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey gave Electrical
Components approval of its pre-packaged reorganization plan,
which swaps debt for new equity, at a hearing today in
Wilmington, Delaware. 
The plan will reduce the company&#8217;s debt by about half,
according to court documents. Electrical Components expects to
leave bankruptcy protection within a few days, said Stephen A. Youngman, a lawyer for the company. 
Under the plan, lenders with the highest level of
repayment, owed a principal amount of about $261.4 million, will
get 54.7 percent of the new common stock and a $145 million term
loan, court papers show. Some of the lenders elected to receive
$10.4 million in cash rather than stock. 
Investors, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp. and
Sankaty Advisors, will buy the remaining 45.3 percent of the new
stock for about $32.9 million, according to court papers. 
Lenders with a secondary priority of repayment, owed a
principal of about $60 million, will share $10 million, court
papers show. Unsecured creditors won&#8217;t be affected by the
restructuring. 
Francisco Partners 
The St. Louis-based company listed assets of about $363.6
million and debt of about $435.7 million in Chapter 11 documents
filed March 30. The company is owned by San Francisco-based
private-equity firm Francisco Partners LP. 
Electrical Components makes wire harnesses, bundles of
wires or cables fitted with connectors or plugs that deliver
electricity throughout appliances, according to court documents. 
The company said it is the largest supplier of wire
harnesses to the North American white-goods market, a term used
for large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.
The company&#8217;s products also are used in automobiles and
construction and agriculture equipment, according to its Web
site. 
Electrical Components generated about $460 million in sales
for the year ended Dec. 31, court papers show. The company
supplies companies such as General Motors Co., Chrysler Group
LLC, General Electric Co., and the world&#8217;s largest appliance
maker, Whirlpool Corp. 
The case is In re Electrical Components International Inc.,
10-11054, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).

Financial markets are likely to
remain volatile as investors weigh the consequences of Europe&#8217;s
rescue package, said Gary Cohn, president and chief operating
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;We will continue to have relatively volatile markets
until we get a better understanding,&#8221; Cohn said today at a
conference in New York hosted by UBS AG. &#8220;To the extent that
the understanding is that it is a socialization of the risk into
many of the other European economies, we may have continued
negative fallout from that because there is an overall view that
some of those other European economies are not strong enough
themselves to be part of a global bailout.&#8221; 
European policy makers yesterday unveiled a loan package
worth almost $1 trillion and a program of bond purchases in an
effort to stop a sovereign-debt crisis that could jeopardize the
euro. The euro and stocks surged around the world yesterday,
then reversed course earlier today. New York-based Goldman Sachs
generates more revenue from sales and trading than any Wall
Street bank. 
&#8220;I think 24 hours after the realization that there&#8217;s a
solution in Europe, people are more reflective right now on what
does that solution mean longer term?&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;Are we
socializing the risk throughout Europe? What does it mean to
other weaker European countries?&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s infrequent
sales and trading losses are evidence that the division doesn&#8217;t
depend on proprietary trading to generate revenue, President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said. 
&#8220;There is often speculation that proprietary trading
revenues drive our outperformance in these businesses,&#8221; Cohn
said today at a financial services conference hosted by UBS AG
in New York. &#8220;Over the last 12 months we have only recorded 11
loss days. It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from sales and
trading than any Wall Street firm, reported yesterday that it
made at least $25 million trading every single day of the first
quarter, the first perfect quarter in the company&#8217;s history. The
company&#8217;s fixed-income, currencies and commodities business,
known as FICC, and equities unit generate those returns by
making markets for clients rather than betting the firm&#8217;s own
money, Cohn said. 
&#8220;The simple answer is that our FICC and equities
businesses are largely global market-making businesses where we
intermediate flows and commit capital and liquidity and in the
process generate revenue including bid-offer spreads,&#8221; Cohn
said. &#8220;These franchises create numerous opportunities for the
firm.&#8221;

&#8220;The higher beta names are down a little bit today after

Patriot Coal Corp., the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal

$34.71. 
Beta is a measurement of volatility. High-beta stocks are
more volatile. Coal is a measure of the economy as it is used to
generate electricity and to make steel. Metallurgical forms of
the fuel are needed by steelmakers.

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc are considering a sale of natural-gas storage capacity
in Germany as they focus on exploration, according to three
people familiar with the matter. 
The companies may begin the process next month after
deciding what assets to sell from their BEB Erdgas und Erdoel
GmbH unit, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the plans are private. The price would depend on what
parts are sold. 
Shell and Exxon hold equal stakes in the Hanover, Germany-
based gas-storage operator, which has about 2 billion cubic
meters of working storage spread over three facilities in the
north of the country, according to its Web site. 
Energy companies are selling filling stations, pipelines
and refineries as they boost spending on oil and gas production
to take advantage of rising prices. Shell is divesting two
German refineries to curb costs and spending, while Exxon sold a
stake in a Norwegian pipe network in April as it reviews assets. 
The BEB storage assets may attract energy suppliers seeking
to stockpile gas to lessen the impact of price fluctuations. Gas
futures in the U.K., Europe&#8217;s largest market for the fuel,
slumped 43 percent in 2009 and are up 15 percent this year. 
Gas-Price Volatility 
&#8220;The attraction of this kind of asset has risen because of
volatility on the gas market,&#8221; said Christian Kleindienst, an
analyst at UniCredit SpA&#8217;s Munich unit with a &#8220;market weight&#8221;
rating on Shell bonds and no coverage of Exxon notes. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want to be just a middleman -- utilities will be looking
to bolster their margins by securing gas they can use to counter
price fluctuations.&#8221; 
David Williams, a spokesman for Shell, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News today. Gabriele Radke, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil Central Europe Holding GmbH, didn&#8217;t
immediately answer an e-mail seeking comment and a call to her
office went unanswered. 
Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, sold its 9.43 percent
stake in Norwegian gas-pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas
Infrastructure AS last month. 
Shell said May 6 that it&#8217;s in talks with potential buyers
for some of its liquefied petroleum gas assets. The company is
also in discussions with India&#8217;s Essar Oil Ltd. and other
interested parties on the sale of three refineries in Germany
and the U.K. 
Exxon and Shell sold about 3,100 kilometers (1,925 miles)
of gas pipelines in Germany to Dutch grid operator Nederlandse
Gasunie NV in 2007. 
Most of Germany&#8217;s gas storage is located in the north of
the country, where rock formations are suited to holding the
fuel. BEB also sells crude oil and sulfur, according to its Web
site.

China, the world&#8217;s second-biggest
electricity consumer, increased power output by the most in
three months in April because of rising demand from industrial
users including carmakers and steel factories. 
Electricity output climbed 21 percent to 331.6 billion
kilowatt-hours last month, according to data from the Beijing-
based National Bureau of Statistics. Crude-oil output gained 4.2
percent to 16.3 million metric tons. The bureau didn&#8217;t provide
coal production data today. 
Industrial production rose 18 percent in April from a year
earlier, increasing electricity needs from factories in the
world&#8217;s biggest exporter of goods. Baoshan Iron  Steel Co.,
China&#8217;s largest publicly traded steelmaker, is running plants at
full capacity as carmakers including General Motors Co. said
they can&#8217;t build enough vehicles to meet demand. 
&#8220;Demand from industries will keep getting stronger,&#8221; Yi Qiao, a power analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone
from Shanghai. 
Property prices rose by a record 12.8 percent in April from
a year earlier, boosting electricity use by builders and makers
of construction materials. 
&#8220;Power output gained last month as the recovery in high-
energy consuming industries accelerated, Sheng Laiyun, spokesman
for the statistics bureau, said today. 
China, the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy, expanded by 11.9
percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in almost three
years. The economy will grow four times faster than the U.S.
this year, the United Nations said in December. 
Energy-Saving Target 
China is facing pressure to meet its energy-saving targets
as the economy expands, Sheng said today. 
The country&#8217;s energy consumption per unit of gross domestic
product rose 3.2 percent in the first quarter, adding to
pressure to cut power intensity for the rest of the year,
Premier Wen Jiabao said in a statement on May 6. 
The first-quarter increase was caused by &#8220;rapid growth&#8221;
in industries including power generation, steel, non-ferrous
metals, construction materials, petroleum and chemicals, Wen
said. 
China&#8217;s electricity use increased 6 percent last year,
according to official data. The country&#8217;s biggest electricity
generators include Huaneng Power International Inc. and Datang
International Power Generation Co.

Jeremy Gerard</headline><body>
British critics have been set
atwitter that the abundantly laureled stage satire &#8220;Enron&#8221;
expired on Broadway Sunday night after barely three weeks,
losing its entire $3.6 million capitalization. 
In London, the show has been a runaway hit since opening
last January in the West End after a sold-out run at the Royal
Court. Here in New York, &#8220;Enron&#8221; didn&#8217;t receive a single major
Tony nomination other than best score -- and it&#8217;s not even a
musical! 
&#8220;Since 9/11 the insular Americans have become terribly
sensitive to criticism,&#8221; Jerry de Groot wrote in the Telegraph.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t mind when Jon Stewart dumps bucketloads of heavy-
handed political satire on the &#8216;Daily Show,&#8217; but they get tetchy
when the criticism is delivered with an English accent.&#8221; 
Michael Billington, the critic of the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian,
suggested Americans were just too stupid to appreciate a satire
requiring a sense of history and a modest understanding of
accounting legerdemain. 
&#8220;If &#8216;Enron&#8217;s&#8217; melancholy saga proves anything,&#8221;
Billington wrote, &#8220;it is Broadway&#8217;s irrelevance to serious
theatre.&#8221; 
He added this: &#8220;At heart, Broadway is a big, gaudy
commercial shop-window, where fortunes are won and lost.&#8221; Stop
the presses! 
Comic Strip 
Still, the abrupt closing shocked me, too. &#8220;Enron&#8221; isn&#8217;t
a great play. But a big, gaudy commercial entertainment? It&#8217;s
that in spades. 
Rupert Goold&#8217;s production of Lucy Prebble&#8217;s broad-stroke
comic strip was as gimcrack as any American idiot could want. It
had four whimsical LED-eyed Velocirapting humanoids devouring
debt. And hot office sex, starring doughy nerd turned master of
his universe Jeffrey Skilling and his in-house competitor
Claudia Roe, while the flashing stock price raced around them. 
Not since Faye Dunaway moaned ratings numbers during a sex
scene in &#8220;Network&#8221; have lust and power been so entertainingly
entangled. 
I called the show&#8217;s lead producer, Jeffrey Richards, whom
I&#8217;ve known since his first Broadway flop, &#8220;Rex,&#8221; in 1976. For
someone lighter by almost $4 million, he was pretty chipper. 
&#8216;Race&#8217; Survived 
&#8220;Look, I believe the straight play can be viable on
Broadway,&#8221; Richards, 61, said. He&#8217;s had a number of hits
recently, including David Mamet&#8217;s &#8220;Race,&#8221; which, unlike
&#8220;Enron,&#8221; survived mostly tepid reviews this season, recovering
its investment. 
When I asked what went wrong with &#8220;Enron,&#8221; Richards
blamed Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;We opened with a sizable advance, but we ate into it
during previews,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then the Goldman Sachs hearings
began. Suddenly we were competing with reality.&#8221; 
This is something of a stretch, though fatigue with
business malfeasance may indeed be one reason the show didn&#8217;t
catch on. 
Richards also said that the play lacked a &#8220;wow factor.&#8221;
People weren&#8217;t leaving the Broadhurst Theatre bristling with the
need to tell anyone who would listen, &#8220;You must see this
show.&#8221; 
I have a different theory, one more typically applied to
musicals: Don&#8217;t confuse your audience. Tell them what to expect
and then give it to them. They&#8217;ll leave happy. 
This is famously what happened when Stephen Sondheim added
&#8220;Comedy Tonight&#8221; to the beginning of &#8220;A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum.&#8221; It let even the dumbest folks in on
the joke, telling them that they were supposed to laugh. 
&#8216;Addams Family&#8217; 
It&#8217;s also what happened more recently, when composer-
lyricist Andrew Lippa rewrote the opening of &#8220;The Addams
Family,&#8221; turning a show critics hated into one that audiences
can&#8217;t get enough of (and the critics still hated). 
&#8220;Who do you think is gonna win in the end, the greedy or
the inept?&#8221; Norbert Leo Butz&#8217;s Skilling asked, after a
delicious screed about the inevitable showdown between
capitalists and bureaucrats. &#8220;We&#8217;re not perfect, but wait til
you see the other guys.&#8221; 
That prompted a collective gasp -- and nervous titters --
the night I saw the show. No one needed to tell these
theatergoers about the parallels between Enron 2001 and Goldman
Sachs 2010. Such bitter pith merely studded the cartoony script. 
Fatal Mistake 
Richards and his marketing team made a fatal mistake in
selling &#8220;Enron&#8221; as the story of Enron. I&#8217;d have put Skilling
in Devil&#8217;s p.j.s, with the Enron &#8220;E&#8221; as his pitchfork. Bring
in a carny barker hawking its Side Show wares. See the Scaly
Raptors! The Two-Faced Man! The Disappearing Cash! 
Then, perhaps, the New York Times&#8217;s Ben Brantley might have
approached the show in a lighter mood, instead of treating it
like a kvetch, an annoying pain he had to endure. He called it
&#8220;a flashy but labored economics lesson...&#8221; Well, maybe for
him. But anyway, that rang the death knell. 
Ever the diplomat, Richards was having none of it. 
&#8220;It is not fair to blame the New York Times for the
failure of the show. There are plays that make it without the
Times.&#8221; 
Not this one. &#8220;Enron&#8221; promised a memory we&#8217;d rather
forget, instead of a thrill ride most of us could really use
just now.

Microsoft Corp. expects customers to
adopt the new version of Office at the fastest pace in the
software&#8217;s 20-year history, helping reverse a sales slump and
fend off competition from Google Inc.&#8217;s Web-based programs. 
The software has been tested by 8.6 million users,
Microsoft said, more than three times as many as any previous
version, signaling that adoption will be quick. Users also are
likely to upgrade to the new package of business software at the
same time they install Windows 7, released last year, said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president in the Office group. 
&#8220;This version will be the best ever in terms of adoption
speed, both because of the interest we are seeing and the
Windows 7 adoption curve,&#8221; Capossela said in an interview last
week. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, held an event in New York today to mark the
official release of Office 2010 to businesses. 
Microsoft&#8217;s $19 billion business division, which gets most
of its revenue from Office, could use the boost. Its sales will
drop 3 percent in the fiscal year ending in June, UBS AG analyst
Brent Thill estimated. While the new software will spur orders
in the coming year, the comeback will hinge on whether
businesses recommit to technology spending -- something they&#8217;ve
been slow to do in the wake of the recession. 
&#8216;Precarious Recovery&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still a precarious recovery,&#8221; said Sarah Friar, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in San Francisco, who
recommends buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the camp of
expecting a more moderate migration. It&#8217;s kind of, &#8216;steady as
she goes.&#8217; It&#8217;s not a raging rush to upgrade.&#8221; 
Microsoft said last month that a recovery in corporate
spending on personal computers and software was just beginning.
Multiyear contracts, which account for 60 percent of the Office
unit&#8217;s sales, are still taking longer to close because
businesses are keeping a lid on expenses. 
Home-computer shoppers have fueled the PC industry&#8217;s
rebound so far, snapping up laptops and netbooks. 
&#8220;I wish I could predict what business PC adoption is going
to be,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s Capossela said. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to see
consumers buying PCs in such numbers. That sets us up for a
great consumer uptake. The business uptake will also be
excellent, but businesses are certainly slower to start spending
money again.&#8221; 
Microsoft rose 56 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $29.44 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
declined 3.4 percent this year. 
Aging Software 
More than half of Office customers now use a version of the
program that&#8217;s at least seven years old, giving Microsoft an
opportunity to get them to upgrade, Thill said. For the year
starting July 1, the new Office will spur an increase of 12
percent in sales for the business division, he predicts. 
General Electric Co. plans to switch about half of its
desktop computers, or about 175,000 machines, to Office 2010
this year, Capossela said today. Royal KPN NV and its subsidiary
Getronics NV already have put the program on some machines and
will roll it out to more than 45,000 this year. 
For the first time, Office will include Web-based versions
of popular programs like Word and Excel. The company already has
40 million users of Internet-delivered versions of its Exchange
e-mail server and SharePoint server programs, which let
customers&#8217; employees create internal company websites and
collaborate on projects.

Office 2010 also adds the ability to edit photos and videos
in PowerPoint presentations, and co-authoring features let
different people work on one file at the same time. Users can
select an option to save documents on the Internet, so they can
be retrieved when employees are away from the office. 
Customers also can broadcast PowerPoint slide shows over
the Internet to any user with a Web browser. The Outlook Social
Connector turns the e-mail program into a central repository for
data from sites like Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn. 
Adding Internet features gives Microsoft fresh ammunition
against Google, which has targeted Office customers with its
Internet-based Google Apps. 
Businesses that already have Office 2007 should just update
it with Google Apps to add Internet and collaboration features,
Google says. Many workers don&#8217;t need a new version of Office, or
any version at all, said Chris Vander Mey, a product manager at
Mountain View, California-based Google. 
&#8220;Office is a really good product and every company should
have two or three copies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a significant
number of employees that don&#8217;t need it.&#8221; 
Google Apps 
Google says 3,000 businesses sign up each day for its apps.
The company lands a large corporate customer every few weeks,
mostly for the Gmail e-mail service, said Andrew Kovacs, a
Google spokesman. Recent new customers include packaging company
MeadWestvaco Corp. and Air France-KLM Group&#8217;s KLM unit, which
will have its 11,200 crew members use Gmail. 
Capossela said Office programs like Outlook and Word are
used by the bulk of workers at Microsoft&#8217;s corporate customers.
Most employees don&#8217;t want to switch to Google, he said.
Uploading a file to Google Apps often doesn&#8217;t preserve details
and formatting, Capossela said. 
Microsoft&#8217;s push into Web-based programs is motivated more
by customer demand than competition with Google, said Friar at
Goldman Sachs. Growth in software delivered as an Internet
service is going to outpace standard programs by 5-to-1, she
said. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a must for them to have done it -- the world is
moving to software as service,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest
shift in the software market.&#8221;

International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, seeking to boost earnings
by focusing on software and services, said he plans to spend $20
billion on acquisitions in the next five years. 
Operating earnings will jump to at least $20 a share by
2015 from $11.35 or more this year, helped by cost savings and
software demand, Palmisano said in a meeting with investors in
New York today. The company also predicted sales growth that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates, sending the stock higher. 
Palmisano is signaling his pace of acquisitions may be
accelerating. He spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases in
the eight years since taking over in 2002, partly to focus on
the higher-margin businesses of services and software. He has
also bought back shares and cut jobs to make up for slowing
corporate spending amid the recession. 
IBM will keep investing in markets that help customers be
more efficient, such as software that helps analyze or predict
trends and cloud computing, which lets them store and access
information on shared servers, Palmisano said. The company is
also developing services to monitor highways, electrical grids
and other infrastructure so they can be run more efficiently.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, said first-quarter profit surged on lower
writedowns and higher life premiums. 
Net income increased to 527 million euros ($668 million)
from 104 million euros a year earlier, when the results were
affected by 1.5 billion euros of writedowns related to equity
holdings, Generali said in a statement today. That beat the
477 million-euro median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;The group expects a full-year operating profit of about
4 billion euros,&#8221; Chief Executive officer Raffaele Agrusti said
on a conference call. The insurer also forecast &#8220;stable&#8221; non-
life premiums for the year and an &#8220;improvement&#8221; in margins at
the life business. 
Cesare Geronzi, named Generali&#8217;s new chairman last month,
wants to boost growth outside Italy. The insurer is already
expanding in emerging markets, including China and the Middle
East, and in eastern Europe as it seeks to recover from the
global financial crisis. 
&#8220;Although the macroeconomic climate remained difficult,
Generali was able to close the first quarter with strong
growth,&#8221; Geronzi said. &#8220;The group can continue to set
ambitious targets.&#8221; 
Storm Claims 
The non-life business, which was affected by rising claims
including many related to Europe&#8217;s winter storm Xinthia,
recorded gross premiums in the period of 6.6 billion euros. The
combined ratio increased to 98 percent in the three months to
the end of March, showing that the company&#8217;s insurance
underwriting is less profitable. Life premiums rose 19 percent
to 14.2 billion euros. 
Generali had &#8220;better results overall&#8221; because of new
life business and improved operating results at the life unit,
Atanasio Pantarrotas, an analyst at Cheuvreux, wrote in a note
to clients today. 
Generali&#8217;s &#8220;net exposure&#8221; to Greek government bonds is
810 million euros, Agrusti said, adding that the insurer has
800 million euros and 670 million euros of &#8220;exposure&#8221; to
Spanish and Portuguese government debt, respectively. 
Generali rose 0.4 percent to 15.74 euros at 5 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 24.6 billion euros.
The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index has dropped 1 percent
in the past six months, compared with Generali&#8217;s 13 percent
decline.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer services provider, projected
operating profit will jump to $20 a share by 2015, helped by
cost savings and demand for its software. 
Software will contribute almost half of the company&#8217;s
earnings, while new growth initiatives will add $20 billion to
sales, according to presentation slides on the company&#8217;s Web
site. IBM is meeting with investors in New York today. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing the
higher-margin businesses of services and software to boost
profit. He has has spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases
since taking over in 2002. He has also bought back shares and
cut jobs to help boost earnings. 
The company plans to save $8 billion through productivity
gains by 2015, while free cash flow should reach $100 billion.
IBM said it plans to give 70 percent of the cash flow to
shareholders. 
IBM also reiterated that earnings per share will grow more
than 10 percent this year, to at least $11.20. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, climbed $1.90, or 1.5
percent, to $128.79 at 10:24 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares had fallen 3.1 percent this year

As International Business Machines
Corp. meets with investors in New York today, some shareholders
want the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider to go beyond
profit goals and pledge itself to more specific sales growth. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano used the shareholder
briefing three years ago to establish a target of $10 in
earnings per share by 2010, a goal he has already reached. Some
investors expect him to set a similar benchmark this year, and
they want him to lay out specific plans for boosting sales at
more than the current low-single digit rate. 
&#8220;I want to see revenue growth,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, a
Cincinnati-based portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Management, who helps manage $13.3 billion, including more than
$100 million of IBM shares. &#8220;Sam Palmisano has come through the
storm, but where do we go from here? What&#8217;s next, Mr. Wizard?&#8221; 
Though investors give IBM credit for reaching the $10-a-
share profit mark a year early, many have sold shares, saying
profit growth may suffer without higher revenue gains. IBM&#8217;s
sales have been little changed in the past five years, while
sales at rival Hewlett-Packard Co. have risen more than 7
percent annually on average, in part because of acquisitions.
IBM&#8217;s earnings per share have been bolstered by stock buybacks
and jobs cuts, which some investors say may not be sustainable.

tighter fiscal policy will lower U.K. growth and that the Bank

&#8220;Sterling positive factors are now being offset by the

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, lost its challenge to a patent that led to a
change in its Word program and to damages of more than $290
million. 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office affirmed a patent
owned by i4i LP of Toronto after a review requested by
Microsoft, closely held i4i said in a statement yesterday. 
&#8220;Put simply: i4i&#8217;s patent is clearly and unequivocally
valid,&#8221; i4i Chairman Loudon Owen said in the statement. &#8220;Even
though Microsoft attacked i4i&#8217;s patent claims with its full
arsenal, the Patent Office agreed with i4i and confirmed the
validity&#8221; of the patent. 
I4i&#8217;s invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. 
&#8220;We are disappointed, but there still remain important
matters of patent law at stake, and we are considering our
options to get them addressed, including a petition to the
Supreme Court,&#8221; Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, said in an e-mail. 
Microsoft lost a jury trial over the patent last year and
was ordered to alter its Word program or halt sales. A U.S.
appeals court upheld both the verdict and the court order. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it&#8217;s used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files. 
The case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). 
Court Tells Patent Holder to Stop Suing PG, Kimberly-Clark 
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that
bars a Maryland patent owner from filing any new patent-
infringement cases against Procter  Gamble Co. and Kimberly-
Clark Corp. 
The Washington-based court, which hears appeals of patent
cases, told Allegra D. Hemphill that a trial court properly
rejected her infringement claims against the two consumer-
products companies as &#8220;baseless accusations.&#8221; 
Hemphill is the named inventor on patent 4,557,720, for a
disposable vaginal applicator. She claimed that personal hygiene
products such as Cincinnati-based PG&#8217;s Always, and Dallas-based
Kimberly-Clark&#8217;s Kotex and Poise infringed her patent, issued in
December 1985, according to court papers. 
Trial courts determined that the sanitary-napkin products
made by the consumer companies didn&#8217;t constitute &#8220;vaginal
swabs&#8221; as the term is used in the patent. 
Hemphill has made &#8220;hundreds of pages of largely repetitive
filings&#8221; that failed to support her case, and engaged &#8220;in a
vexatious pattern of filing multiple duplicative lawsuits,
forum-shopping among various district and appellate courts&#8221; the
appeals court said. The court said it is &#8220;apparent&#8221; that her
claims are without merit and &#8220;baseless.&#8221; 
The patent owner represented herself in the appeal. 
The case is Hemphill v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 10-01047,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). 
SABMiller Patents Easy-to-Open Beer Can That Doubles as Cup 
SABMiller Plc said it patented an easy-to-open beer can
that doubles as a cup after the entire top has been removed. 
The can is a first in the global beer industry and will be
used at the World Cup soccer tournament that starts in South
Africa next month, Norman Adami, managing director of the
Johannesburg-based unit, told reporters in the city yesterday. 
The brewer, which said it has invested 170 million rand
($22.6 million) in support of the World Cup, said in a statement
yesterday that it expects to sell the equivalent of 30 million
more bottles of beer during the tournament than it normally
sells in June and July in South Arica. 
Pesticide Management Bill Faces Opposition Over Data Monopoly 
India&#8217;s Bjaratiya Janta Party opposes a bill for pesticide
management currently under consideration, the Economic Times
reported. 
The party&#8217;s objection is to a section on pesticide-testing
&#8220;data exclusivity,&#8221; which it claims is the result of pressure
from U.S. chemical companies, the newspaper reported. 
The bill gives researchers a 20-year monopoly over their
data, which the party claims would make it difficult for generic
versions of the product to be created, according to the Economic
Times. 
Permitting data monopoly to go ahead may lead to higher
pesticide prices, a party leader told the Economic Times. 
Prisoner-Restraint Patent Issued to Utah Inventors 
Two Utah inventors received a U.S. patent yesterday for a
method of securing a prisoner to a motor vehicle. 
Patent 7,723,300 covers a device that can be hooked to the
prisoner&#8217;s handcuffs that will keep the prisoner&#8217;s hands behind
his back and prevent his escape from a police vehicle. 
According to the patent, the device can be triggered
remotely, and can be used even if the prisoner is placed in a
vehicle&#8217;s front seat. While the prisoner is tethered to the car
seat, &#8220;the police officer can then go about his other necessary
duties which may include: dealing with other suspects, searching
or inventorying a vehicle, talking with victims and witnesses.&#8221; 
The device can be used in conjunction with an automobile
seatbelt, and, in the event of a collision, can be released by
means of a remote-control switch, or cut with a knife or
scissors. 
The application for the patent was filed in March 2006 with
assistance from the Bateman IP Law Group of Salt Lake City. The
patent was issued to Keith D. Squires of Morgan, Utah, and Omar
L. Issa of Venice, Utah. 
Copyright 
Viacom, Indian Company Accused of Infringing Runyon Rights 
Viacom Inc. was sued for copyright infringement by the
owner of the copyright for a short story by the late Damon
Runyon. 
The lawsuit related to an Indian movie, &#8220;Singh is Kinng,&#8221;
which American Rights Management Co. of New York claims is
derived from Runyon&#8217;s &#8220;Madame La Gimp.&#8221; The 2008 Bollywood
film was directed by Anees Bazmee and starred Akshay Kumar and
Katrina Kaif. 
Viacom was sued as the film&#8217;s distributor. Vipul Amrutlal
Shah, producer of &#8220;Singh is Kinng&#8221; told Agence France-Presse
that he was &#8220;truly baffled&#8221; at the infringement allegations,
and the fact that the rights holder waited two years to file a
complaint. 
The Runyon story, originally published in 1929 in Hearst
Corp.&#8217;s Cosmopolitan magazine, is &#8220;generally recognizable by
the public&#8221; through several derivative films, Frank Capra&#8217;s
&#8220;Lady for a Day&#8221; and &#8220;Pocketful of Miracles,&#8221; and Jackie
Chan&#8217;s &#8220;Miracles,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
American Rights claims that the Bollywood film also
infringes the copyright for the two Capra films. 
The short story&#8217;s copyright holder claims the Bollywood
film is similar in essence, structure, pattern and sequence,
pace, setting, characterization and mood. The defendants
&#8220;purposefully employed immaterial variations or transparent re-
phrasing to produce essentially an update&#8221; of the Runyon story,
according to the complaint. 
American Rights asked the court to order the defendants to
quit infringing the copyright, including barring future
distribution of the film. Additionally, the rights holder
requested an award of money damages, litigation costs and
attorney fees, and extra cash compensation to punish the
defendants&#8217; for their actions. 
The rights holder is represented by Steven M. Hayes, of New
York&#8217;s Hanly Conroy Bierstein Sheridan Fisher LLP, and Clay M.
Townsend and Keith R. Mitnik, of Orlando, Florida&#8217;s Morgan 
Morgan PA. 
The case is American Rights Management v. Viacom 18 US,
1:10-cv-03690-VM, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan)). 
Trademark 
EA to Take Make &#8216;Spore&#8217; Darker, Trademark Application Hints 
Electronic Arts Inc., whose &#8220;Spore&#8221; was the most pirated
game in 2008, is taking the game to the dark side, if recent
trademark applications are any indication. 
The Redwood City, California-based games company filed four
applications to register &#8220;Darkspore&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office on May 3. 
Electronic Arts seeks to register the mark for a wide range
of goods and products including film production, online computer
games, action figures, playing cards, board games, pajamas, T-
shirts, and computer and video-game software. 
Newspaper Reveals Hidden Ownership of Bafana Bafana Brand 
A month before South Africa hosts the World Cup soccer
games, the country&#8217;s Times newspaper reported that Wayne Smidt,
a Johannesburg businessman, owns 49.9 percent of Slam, a company
that controls the trademark rights to Bafana Bafana, the
country&#8217;s national team. 
The South African Football Association owns the other 50.1
percent of the company, according to the Times. 
Smidt told the Times he objected to the newspaper&#8217;s
&#8220;drawing sinister motives&#8221; from his refusal to divulge more
information about the ownership or how much money he expected to
make during the World Cup games. 
Vivian Casaletti, Slam&#8217;s chief executive, said she expected
at least 1.6 million Bafana Bafana items to be sold, and that
the team licensing program  -- under which Slam makes 15 percent
on each item sold -- is &#8220;the most successful licensing program
in Africa,&#8221; according to the Times. 
Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Makeup of Chemical Dispersant Used in Gulf a Trade Secret 
Scientists and Louisiana fishermen say they are worried
about damage chemical dispersants may cause the region&#8217;s
fisheries and their lack of knowledge of the chemicals being
used, the U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph reported. 
More than 325,000 gallons of dispersants have been used on
waters in the Gulf of Mexico in efforts to halt the spread of
the oil that has been spewing from beneath the sea since the
April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig leased
by BP Plc, according to the Telegraph. 
The product used to break up the oil is Corexit, produced
by Nalco Holding Co.&#8217;s Nalco Energy Services, the newspaper
reported. 
LuAnn White, a Tulane University toxicologist, told the
Telegraph &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; what&#8217;s in the product &#8220;because it&#8217;s
a trade secret.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman denied allegations the U.S. bank misled
investors about mortgage derivatives it sold them. 
The firm is being probed by U.S. prosecutors over whether
the bank misled clients when it sold them collateralized debt
obligations as its own traders bet that the value of the
securities would drop, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
The New York-based firm hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the Justice
Department, Gorman told reporters in Tokyo today. 
Wall Street firms are facing unprecedented scrutiny from
lawmakers and prosecutors over whether they missold CDOs linked
to the subprime mortgages that caused the credit crisis. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. is fighting a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm misled investors
about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. 
&#8220;We should expect to see a whole slew of cases appear
through the rest of the year,&#8221; said Ralph Silva, an analyst at
London-based Silva Research Network, which specializes in
financial services firms. &#8220;Because they are near-impossible to
prove, I suspect most are going to be settled on the threat of a
perp walk.&#8221; 
The bank fell to $27.72 at 12:15 p.m. in German trading
from its $28.38 close in New York yesterday. The shares have
dropped 4 percent this year, compared with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financials Index&#8217;s 10 percent gain in the period. 
No &#8216;Substance&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley arranged and sold CDOs backed by home loans,
even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their value
would fall, the Journal said, citing traders. The investigation
is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly represented its
roles, according to the report. 
&#8220;We have no reason to believe there is any substance behind
any supposed investigation that appeared in the Wall Street
Journal article,&#8221; Gorman said at the press conference, convened
to discuss the firm&#8217;s Japanese securities and investment banking
ventures with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. 
Spokesmen for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office and the
SEC declined to comment, the Journal said. 
Government officials in the U.S. are seeking to assuage
public anger over bank bailouts by tightening regulations after
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis that led
to $1.78 trillion in writedowns and losses by financial firms. 
The probe stemmed from an ongoing civil-fraud investigation

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman denied allegations the U.S. bank misled
investors about mortgage derivatives it sold them. 
The firm is being probed by U.S. prosecutors over whether
the bank misled clients when it sold them collateralized debt
obligations as its own traders bet that the value of the
securities would drop, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
The New York-based firm hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the Justice
Department, Gorman told reporters in Tokyo today. 
Wall Street firms are facing unprecedented scrutiny from
lawmakers and prosecutors over whether they improperly sold CDOs
linked to the subprime mortgages that caused the credit crisis.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is fighting a lawsuit from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm
misled investors about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. 
&#8220;We should expect to see a whole slew of cases appear
through the rest of the year,&#8221; said Ralph Silva, an analyst at
London-based Silva Research Network, which specializes in
financial services firms. &#8220;Because they are near-impossible to
prove, I suspect most are going to be settled on the threat of a
perp walk.&#8221; 
The bank fell to $27.72 at 12:15 p.m. in German trading
from its $28.38 close in New York yesterday. The shares have
dropped 4 percent this year, compared with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financials Index&#8217;s 10 percent gain in the period. 
No &#8216;Substance&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley arranged and sold CDOs backed by home loans,
even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their value
would fall, the Journal said, citing traders. The investigation
is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly represented its
roles, according to the report. 
&#8220;We have no reason to believe there is any substance behind
any supposed investigation that appeared in the Wall Street
Journal article,&#8221; Gorman said at the press conference, convened
to discuss the firm&#8217;s Japanese securities and investment banking
ventures with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. 
Spokesmen for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office and the
SEC declined to comment, the Journal said. 
Government officials in the U.S. are seeking to assuage
public anger over bank bailouts by tightening regulations after
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis that led
to $1.78 trillion in writedowns and losses by financial firms. 
The probe stemmed from an ongoing civil-fraud investigation
of more than a dozen Wall Street firms&#8217; mortgage bond businesses
by the SEC that began in 2009, the newspaper said. The Manhattan
U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office is conducting a criminal probe into some

Morgan Stanley is being probed by U.S.
federal prosecutors over allegations it misled investors about
mortgage derivatives, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter that it didn&#8217;t identify. 
Investments known as collateralized debt obligations, or
CDOs, backed by home loans, were arranged and sold by Morgan
Stanley even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their
value would fall, the newspaper said, citing traders. The
investigation is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly
represented its roles, the WSJ said. 
The probe, which is at a preliminary stage, marks deepening
scrutiny of Wall Street firms by U.S. regulators following the
global financial crisis, the Journal said. Rival Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. is contesting a fraud lawsuit from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm
misled investors about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. 
&#8220;We have not been contacted by the Justice Department
about the transactions being raised by the Wall Street Journal,
and we have no knowledge of a Justice Department investigation
into these transactions,&#8221; Morgan Stanley spokesman Nick Footitt
said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News. 
Spokespeople for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office and
the SEC declined to comment, the Journal said.

Bonds sold by U.S. financial firms
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. offer value after a fraud
lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused spreads
to widen, according to BT Investment Management Ltd. 
BTIM, a manager of about A$13.5 billion ($12.1 billion) of
cash and fixed-income assets, has been buying bonds of U.S.
institutions such as Goldman Sachs that mature in about a year,
and is considering buying more, head of income strategies Scott Osborne and senior portfolio manager Jean-Luc Petit said in an
interview in Sydney. 
&#8220;Short-dated U.S. financial notes offer more bang for your
buck than their global peers,&#8221; said Osborne. &#8220;While the
spreads have widened on the recent SEC probe issues, the U.S.
economic recovery will underpin the strength of the financial
system in the medium term.&#8221; 
U.S. financial debt has lost almost 1 percent since the SEC
filed its suit against the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history on April 16, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows,
after handing investors profits in 11 of the 12 months ending
March. The lawsuit sparked concern the government will crack
down on Wall Street and hurt profits, even as the U.S. economy
recovers from the worst global recession since World War II.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
Street firm facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, named E. Gerald Corrigan and J. Michael Evans to oversee a new business standards committee. 
Corrigan, 68, joined the firm in 1994 after a 25-year
career at the Federal Reserve, culminating as president of the
New York Fed. Evans, 52, arrived in 1993 after 10 years at
Salomon Brothers, now part of Citigroup Inc., and is both a vice
chairman of the company and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia. The
panel will make a final report public after a December board
meeting, Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, announced plans to create the committee at
the firm&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting on May 7. He said the
panel, formed after the SEC lawsuit and a U.S. Senate grilling
of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top executives over their treatment of
clients, would make recommendations on how the firm could
reinforce its focus on clients and ethics. 
&#8220;This initiative is consistent with our obligation to
ensure that our standards across our business activities are of
the highest quality and represent the benchmark for the industry
globally,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, said in today&#8217;s statement. 
The committee will have 17 members, the firm said. They
include Chief Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder, who will
serve as the panel&#8217;s chief operating officer, and David Greenwald, the firm&#8217;s international general counsel and deputy
general counsel, who will provide legal advice. 
Cooper, Daffey, Gnodde 
The other members are: Edith Cooper, global head of human
capital management; Michael Daffey, global head of equities
sales and securities distribution in Europe; Richard Gnodde, co-
CEO of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s European business; David Heller, global

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will buy
Nexen Inc.&#8217;s North American natural-gas trading business for an
undisclosed price, reducing volatility in Nexen&#8217;s earnings. 
Nexen Vice President Pierre Alvarez confirmed the sale in
an e-mail today. The trading assets will be sold to J. Aron 
Co., the commodity-trading division of Goldman Sachs, Alvarez
said. Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, confirmed the sale and refused further comment. 
The sale is expected to be cash-neutral, Nexen said in an
April 30 filing, and the Calgary-based company said it would
likely report a $250 million to $290 million non-cash loss
associated with the sale. The company said in the filing its
marketing business has generated about $800 million in cash
during the last 10 years. 
&#8220;They probably had contracts that were loss positions that
these guys had to take, so as a result it was cash-neutral,&#8221;
said Kristopher Zack, an analyst with Raymond James Ltd. in
Calgary. 
While the sale won&#8217;t boost Nexen&#8217;s cash flow, it will
likely remove volatility from the oil exploration and production
company&#8217;s results, Zack said. 
Nexen sold its European gas and power-marketing business
earlier this year. The company was formed by Occidental
Petroleum Corp. when it combined its Canadian units in the early
1970s.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
securities firm that makes about 10 percent of its revenue from
trades on its own behalf, is ceasing proprietary trading in one
type of structured debt, according to a person close to the
firm. 
A group of traders who were focused on making bets on
collateralized loan obligations with the New York-based firm&#8217;s
own money are now handling trades for clients, the person said,
speaking anonymously because the plans aren&#8217;t public. CLOs are
bonds backed by pools of corporate loans. Andrea Rachman, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm, merged
the proprietary trading desk with the team that handles
transactions for clients as it wound down the positions in the
proprietary trading book, the person said. Both groups were run
by Gerald Ouderkirk, who was promoted to managing director in
October 2006. 
Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported on the
changes in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s CLO trading division in its May 14
issue. 
CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation, debt
instruments that repackage loans into securities of varying risk
that pay investors different yields. The market boomed in the
first half of the last decade, helping fuel a spree of leveraged
buyouts by providing demand for loans that helped reduce the
cost of funding. The market dried up in 2007 and 2008 as the
mortgage market crisis caused investors to flee from structured
credit into simpler and safer securities. 
The fair value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s retained interests in
CDOs and CLOS dropped to $367 million at the end of November
2008 from $1.97 billion two years earlier, according to company
filings.

who fielded a call from Dimon after helping lead protests
against his selection as commencement speaker. &#8220;Otherwise, it&#8217;s

More than 1,200 Syracuse students, alumni and supporters

General Motors Co. said slowing
growth in China won&#8217;t prompt the company, the largest overseas
automaker in the nation, to revise its 2010 sales forecast. 
GM sales in China will exceed 2 million vehicles this year,
said Kevin Wale, president of the company&#8217;s China operations, in
Ningbo, China, reiterating an earlier projection. Carmakers will
sell a combined 15.5 million vehicles in China in 2010, he said. 
China&#8217;s monthly car-sales growth slowed in April to the
lowest level since March 2009 amid rising consumer and property
prices. Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles increased 33 percent to 1.11 million from a year
earlier, compared with a 63 percent jump in March, the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said on May 10. 
Slowing growth is &#8220;a natural part of the industry cycle,&#8221;
Wale said today at a conference in Ningbo, a city in the eastern
part of China. &#8220;People need to manage it so they don&#8217;t end with
excess inventory. The market is still very strong. Underlying
demand is very strong.&#8221; 
China, which overtook the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest auto
market last year, has become GM&#8217;s largest market. The carmaker
aims to sell 3 million vehicles a year in China by 2015. It
plans to introduce 25 new or updated models in the country by
the end of 2011. 
In April, Detroit-based GM sold 213,115 vehicles in China.
The company and its ventures sold 1.83 million vehicles in the
country last year. 
The Chinese car market is &#8220;stabilizing, it&#8217;s not
continuing to grow at the rapid rate&#8221; of last year, Wale said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a good year for the industry, and a good year
for General Motors&#8221; in China.

malignancy, the authors said. That data, though, was flawed, the
authors concluded, saying that more study would be needed to
establish a definitive link. 
The report by the World Health Organization&#8217;s International
Agency for Research on Cancer is the latest in a series of
conflicting studies exploring whether a connection exists
between mobile phones and cancer. Most have failed to identify a
link. The debate has turned on the fact that the phones emit
radio waves and, at higher levels than that released by phones,
the emissions heat body tissue and spur tumors, according to the
National Cancer Institute&#8217;s website. 
&#8220;An increased risk of brain cancer is not established,&#8221;
said Christopher Wild, director of the International Agency for
Research on Cancer, in a statement. More studies are needed to
definitely rule out a link in the heaviest mobile-phone users to
malignancy, the researchers said. 
Brain Tumors 
The study participants included 5,117 patients who had
either a meningioma, a slow-growing brain tumor, or glioma, a
deadly type of brain tumor. They were matched with comparison
subjects who didn&#8217;t have brain cancer, and all were questioned
on their mobile phone use. 
Researchers found &#8220;suggestions&#8221; of a 40 percent higher
risk of glioma in those who were in the top 10 percent for the
longest cumulative call time, the study authors said. That risk
was greatest in people with brain cancer who reported that they
often held their phones on the same side of their head as their
gliomas developed, the authors said. 
The higher cancer risk seen in heaviest users may not be a
reliable finding because it was based on the amount of time
people remembered talking on their phones, according to the
study. Brain tumors can confuse thinking and affect memory,
which could influence the results. Researchers said a higher
proportion of people with gliomas were judged by their
interviewers to have poor memory. 
&#8216;Too Early&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still too early to say if there is a higher risk
because cancer, particularly brain cancer, can take years to
develop,&#8221; often longer than the 10 years of phone use in some
participants of the WHO study, said Henry Lai, a bioengineering
researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, in a
telephone interview. Lai, who has studied mobile phone safety,
wasn&#8217;t involved in the WHO research. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not beyond the realm of possibility that there&#8217;s a
link&#8221; between mobile phone use and cancer, said Peter Inskip,
senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Maryland. 
More study is needed to look at a possible link between
brain cancer and growing use of mobile phones by children,
Inskip said. &#8220;What we might have considered heavy use 10 years
ago might not be considered heavy use now,&#8221; he said. 
People in the study reported spending a median time of 2 to
2.5 hours a month on their mobile phones, the study said. The
heaviest users -- about 10 percent of the total -- said they
spent 1,640 cumulative hours on the phone. Participants reported
their use for periods ranging from one year to more than 10
years, according to the research. 
FDA Statement 
The study&#8217;s findings show little or no risk of brain tumors
for most long-term users of cell phones, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said today in a statement. 
&#8220;There are still questions on the effect of long-term
exposure to radio frequency energy that are not fully answered&#8221;
by the WHO study, Abiy Desta, network leader for science at the
FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said today in
the statement. &#8220;However, this study provides information that
will be of great value in assessing the safety of cell phone
use.&#8221; 
The FDA has the authority to require manufacturers to
notify consumers and repair, replace or recall mobile phones if
they are ever found to emit radiofrequency energy at a hazardous
level, according to a fact sheet on the agency&#8217;s website. 
Young People 
&#8220;Today, mobile phone use has become much more prevalent,
and it is not unusual for young people to use mobile phones for
an hour or more a day,&#8221; the WHO researchers said in a
statement. The increased use is partially offset by younger
people&#8217;s preference for hands-free calling, texting over phone
calls and lower emissions of some newer phones, the researchers
said. 
The study&#8217;s findings &#8220;are consistent with conclusions
reached in an already large body of scientific research on this
subject,&#8221; John Walls, a spokesman for CTIA-The Wireless
Association, a Washington-based trade group for the wireless
industry, said today in a statement. 
More than one-third, or $6.8 million, of the study&#8217;s $23.7
million cost came from the mobile-phone and other industry
sources, according to a news release from the World Health
Organization. The researchers came from 13 countries, including
Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel,
Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. No one
was involved from the U.S. 
&#8216;Not Established&#8217; 
The number of wireless accounts grew to 285.6 million in
December from 109.5 million in 2000, according to CTIA. The
number of U.S. households that only have wireless phones was
almost 23 percent in December, up from 8.4 percent in 2005, the
CTIA said. 
Previous studies include a December report by investigators
from the U.S. National Cancer Institute using cancer registries
in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, covering more than 16
million adults, to track the number of people diagnosed with
brain tumors since 1974, when mobile phone use in those
countries began seeing widespread use. The researchers found no
surge in brain cancer cases. 
A study of 420,000 Danish people who used mobile phones for
an average of 8.5 years, reported in December 2006, also found
no increase in cancers. 
Ramon Llamas, a phone-industry analyst at Framingham,
Massachusetts-based International Data Corp., suggested studying
the use of mobile phones going forward was a moving target. 
&#8220;No one wants to do something that endangers their health,
but consumer behavior on mobile phones is changing dramatically
already,&#8221; Llamas said in an interview. &#8220;Every carrier has seen
a dramatic change toward people texting and using data more,
which brings the phone away from the ear.&#8221; 
The newest study &#8220;illustrates how difficult it is to
identify and corroborate, or definitively rule out, any possible
association,&#8221; said John E. Niederhuber, director of the U.S.
National Cancer Institute.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
ended talks to hire Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP
to bolster its legal team. 
The discussions, which started earlier this month, were
terminated last week and Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t plan to hire
another law firm instead, a person briefed on the matter said,
speaking anonymously because the talks were private. 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
that the firm isn&#8217;t hiring Paul, Weiss. Madelaine Miller, a
spokeswoman for Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking
comment. 
Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, was seeking additional legal advice as it
faces issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
month. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the firm&#8217;s
activities in the area, people familiar with the matter said
last month. 
The plan was to supplement, not replace, the company&#8217;s
current legal advisers including Sullivan  Cromwell LLP. 
Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of the Senate
hearing from K. Lee Blalack II of O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has
previously worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s chief counsel and staff
director. Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White
House counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. 
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 59 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$142.64 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
has dropped 15.5 percent this year, the most of the biggest six
banks in the U.S. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. reverse-
convertible note paying 64 percent annualized interest plunged
in value on May 14, three days after being sold, showing the
risks of these products usually bought by individual investors. 
The structured notes offered 10.7 percent in interest
payments over their two-month term and a return of principal, as
long as shares of TiVo Inc. didn&#8217;t fall more than 25 percent,
according to a prospectus. TiVo dropped 42 percent on May 14
after an adverse court ruling, triggering a provision that will
leave investors holding the possibly depressed stock at
maturity. 
Banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc
sold $656 million of reverse convertibles in the U.S. last
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities,
which combine features of bonds and stock options, are often
sold to individuals who don&#8217;t understand the risks, said Jake Zamansky, a New York-based attorney who represents investors. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s being sold as a bond, an income-generating product,
and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s being explained to people that you can
get stuck with the stock,&#8221; the securities lawyer at Zamansky 
Associates said in a telephone interview on May 14. He has
represented investors in lawsuits related to the products. 
Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
The prospectus&#8217;s listing of risk considerations includes the
statements &#8220;your investment in the notes may result in a loss&#8221;
and &#8220;your protection may terminate on any day.&#8221; &#8220;Protection&#8221;
refers to the feature where the principal is returned unless, on
any day, the stock closes 25 percent below its initial price. 
Receiving Stock 
Because that level was breached, noteholders will receive
at maturity as many shares of the stock as their investment
would have bought at the initial price, hence the name &#8220;reverse
convertible.&#8221; 
&#8220;Individuals should be buying reverse convertibles on
stocks that they otherwise would consider owning outright,&#8221;
said Keith Styrcula, chairman of the New York-based Structured
Products Association, in a telephone interview today. 
Investors in JPMorgan&#8217;s notes could make money if TiVo&#8217;s
share price recovers. The stock was up 5.8 percent, to $10.75,
at 1:09 p.m. today in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange,
compared with $16.88 when the notes were issued. 
JPMorgan sold $800,000 of the TiVo-linked products, it said
in the prospectus. The 64 percent interest rate was the highest
offered on any reverse convertible in months, according to Craig McCann, a Fairfax, Virginia-based litigation consultant who&#8217;s
preparing a study of the market. 
&#8216;Ridiculous&#8217; Commission 
The price of the securities included a 1.75 percent sales
commission, of which JPMorgan received 0.75 percentage point,
according to the prospectus. That&#8217;s 10.5 percent on an
annualized basis, which is much higher than the commission
charged on comparable investments, according to Seth Lipner, a
Garden City, New York-based attorney. 
&#8220;A 10.5 percent commission is ridiculous,&#8221; Lipner said in
a telephone interview on May 14. &#8220;The cost would be much
lower&#8221; for investors to make the same kind of market bet using
various options rather than reverse convertibles, he said. 
Structured notes generally include other costs, such as to
offset risks related to the security, as well as a profit for
the issuer. The built-in costs of the TiVo-linked note were
limited to the 1.75 percent commission, according to the
prospectus. 
Each $1,000 TiVo note was worth $945 on the day it was
offered, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s reverse-convertible pricing
model. McCann said his model came up with an initial value of
$960. Prices generated by the models vary based on the source of
market data and assumptions about liquidity and volatility. 
Court Case 
TiVo&#8217;s decline came after an appeals court said on May 14
it would reconsider the company&#8217;s victory over Dish Network
Corp. and EchoStar Corp. in a digital-video recording patent
case. Dish and EchoStar had asked on April 5 for the full panel
of the appeals court to rehear the case. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think something with a major development about to
take place, positive or negative, should be put into a reverse
convertible,&#8221; Zamansky said. &#8220;There&#8217;s just too much
volatility.&#8221; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s prospectus states that TiVo&#8217;s stock &#8220;has
experienced significant fluctuations.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mention the
pending patent case. 
Many investors who lost money on reverse convertibles have
filed arbitration claims against their brokers, according to
Zamansky. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a trade
group, said in a February letter to its members that reverse
convertibles can be &#8220;difficult for retail investors and
registered representatives to evaluate.&#8221; Brokers&#8217; sales pitches
must be &#8220;fair and balanced,&#8221; it said. 
Brokers often market reverse convertibles as a way for
individuals to take advantage of the sophisticated derivatives
trading that banks use, according to Chris Vernon, a Naples,
Florida-based attorney who represents structured-note investors. 
&#8220;The pitch with these complex structured products is that
this is what the big boys are doing and now you can do it too,&#8221;
Vernon said in a telephone interview on May 14. &#8220;But the big
boys aren&#8217;t paying 10 percent-plus commission per year.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. agreed to settle a
wrongful-death lawsuit alleging its Neurontin epilepsy medicine
caused a retired minister to commit suicide two months after he
started taking the drug. 
Lawyers for New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, told a judge in Nashville, Tennessee, they resolved
claims by the family of Richard Smith, which were set to go to
trial today. It&#8217;s the second settlement of claims that officials
of a Pfizer unit knew the epilepsy drug posed a suicide risk and
failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased the case has been resolved,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Aleta Trauger told lawyers for Smith&#8217;s family and
the company today. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Smith, 79, was a
retired Church of Christ minister, according to court papers. He
was taking the drug to deal with chronic pain, not epilepsy, the
filings show. 
Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. In March, a Boston jury ordered
Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to an insurer
over its marketing practices in connection with the drug. Pfizer
has denied any wrongdoing in connection with its handling of
Neurontin. 
&#8216;Great Sympathy&#8217; 
Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a $430
million fine. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. 
&#8220;We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the
Smith family to resolve this case as it avoids the time and
expense of a trial,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We have great sympathy for the Smith
family and respect their desire for privacy regarding the
outcome of the case.&#8221; 
By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Smith&#8217;s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. 
As part of the guilty plea, Warner-Lambert officials
acknowledged the company engaged in &#8220;deceptive off-label
marketing&#8221; of Neurontin, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said in 2004. 
&#8216;Snake-Oil List&#8217; 
A former Warner-Lambert medical liaison testified in an
earlier Neurontin suit he was trained to market the drug to
doctors for uses beyond those approved by regulators. Dr. David
Franklin, who won a $25 million whistleblower suit against the
drugmaker over the medicine, said he was given a &#8220;snake-oil
list&#8221; of unapproved uses to help pump up Neurontin&#8217;s sales.
Franklin had been set to testify in Smith&#8217;s case. 
Smith, who worked part-time as a service manager at a
Nashville office-machines store, began taking Neurontin in March
2004 to deal with chronic pain tied to back and neck surgeries,
according to court filings. Lawyers for his family say in the
filings that Warner-Lambert officials didn&#8217;t properly warn
Smith&#8217;s doctors the drug had been found to cause depression and
suicidal thoughts in some users. 
&#8216;Forgive Me&#8217; 
In May, Smith killed himself with a gunshot to the head,
according to the filings. In a note he left to his family, Smith
indicated he was tired of being in pain. 
&#8220;Forgive me; I cannot go on like this, I cannot have my
body, the temple of the Holy Spirit, cut on anymore,&#8221; Smith
said in the note. &#8220;I have talked to God all night and he
understands.&#8221; 
Lawyers for Smith&#8217;s family said he&#8217;d told relatives prior
to his suicide that the Neurontin &#8220;was making him feel not
himself,&#8221; according to court filings. &#8220;Mr. Smith&#8217;s death was
inexplicable to family members because Mr. Smith was a godly man
and he knew suicide was wrong,&#8221; they added in the filing. 
Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers countered in their filings Smith suffered
through &#8220;numerous surgeries&#8221; which left him dealing with
&#8220;increasing pain.&#8221; The retired minister told his family he
&#8220;wished he could die because of the pain and the depression,&#8221;
the filing added. 
The case is Ruby Smith v. Pfizer Inc., 05-cv-11515-PBS,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville).

Supertanker shipping rates may more
than double to $50,000 a day as the premium the third-month
futures contract holds over the front month encourages traders
to use the tankers to store crude, Morgan Stanley said. 
&#8220;With the forward price of crude oil surging, the amount
of vessels used for floating storage should coincidentally
increase, cutting available supply to the market and driving
freight rates up,&#8221; Ole Slorer, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said
in a report yesterday. 
The premium the third-month Brent crude contract holds over
the front month, a formation known as a contango, rose to $2.31
a barrel on May 13 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest level since Oct. 15, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s up from 55 cents on March 17. The contango was
$1.84 today. 
&#8220;At current contango levels, we calculate that the current
spread justifies VLCC rates above $50,000 per day,&#8221; Slorer
said. 
The average shipping rates for very-large crude carriers,
or VLCCs, was $22,281 a day as of May 14, according to the
London-based Baltic Exchange. The rate to ship oil to Japan from
the Middle East using VLCCs was $30,225. 
VLCCs can haul about 2 million barrels of oil.

of units.&#8221; 
The units were &#8220;getting back to normal&#8221; by midmorning

&#8220;It took some time for the power to be restored and then
it took us a little while to get the plant up and running
again,&#8221; Bailey said. &#8220;It does have a short-term impact, but
we&#8217;re not anticipating any measurable supply impacts out in the

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, is upgrading Hotmail to make it easier to manage
the flow of photos, videos and social-networking updates to a
user&#8217;s inbox. 
The new version, scheduled to be released in July or
August, is designed to allow easier document sharing and provide
a quick view of photos and videos at the top of e-mails. The
upgrade also helps users easily send photos, videos and other
media, along with Web links, to their contacts. 
Microsoft, which sells ads next to Hotmail inboxes, is
updating the service to attract users from rivals such as Yahoo!
Inc. and Google Inc. While Hotmail is the leading e-mail service
worldwide, it&#8217;s No. 2 in the U.S. behind Yahoo Mail, according
to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google&#8217;s Gmail, the
fastest-growing of the leaders, was third. 
&#8220;This update, I think, is the most significant one we&#8217;ve
ever done,&#8221; said Chris Jones, a corporate vice president at
Microsoft. &#8220;We are already second. We hope this is a product
that can take us to first.&#8221; 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 21 cents to
$28.60 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The shares have fallen 6.2 percent this year. 
With the Hotmail upgrade, users can quickly see whether
they have e-mails from friends and social networks, along with
messages about package shipments or appointments, without
sorting through the inbox. Another feature, called &#8220;sweep,&#8221;
lets users clean out or move a block of similar e-mails with a
few clicks of the mouse.

Morgan Stanley shareholders voted
against a proposal that would have required the chairman be an
independent director who hasn&#8217;t previously served as an
executive officer of the company. 
Shareholders rejected the plan today at the company&#8217;s
annual meeting in Purchase, New York, where they approved all of
management&#8217;s proposals and voted against all of the measures
proposed by shareholders, Chief Legal Officer Gary Lynch said. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s board of directors unanimously opposed the
idea, saying in the proxy that investors are best served by
&#8220;maintaining the flexibility to have any individual serve as
chairman of the board.&#8221; The proposal was submitted by the
Laborers National Pension Fund. Current Chairman John Mack, 65,
was also chief executive officer until this year, when James Gorman, 51, took over. 
In response to a shareholder at the meeting who said it
appeared Mack was still running the company, Mack said he would
quit if Gorman ever told him he was an obstacle. 
&#8220;I made it very clear to James Gorman that at any point if
I&#8217;m in his way, he needs to let me know and I&#8217;ll resign,&#8221; Mack
said. 
The meeting was held at the headquarters of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s wealth-management unit. Fewer than 75 outside
shareholders attended the one-hour meeting, including one woman
who was knitting throughout the proceedings. 
Board Re-Elected 
Shareholders voted to re-elect board members, and approved
38 million additional shares to be used for equity-based
compensation during the next year. Morgan Stanley said in the
proxy that the shares are needed to address calls from
regulators that a greater proportion of pay be comprised of
stock. 
Morgan Stanley executives have sent letters to shareholders
in the past month asking them to vote in favor of the proposal
on approving new shares. Two proxy advisory groups have come out
in opposition and four institutional shareholders have sent in
their votes against it, according to the website Proxy
Democracy. 
Shareholders approved 25 million shares at last year&#8217;s
meeting as the firm added thousands of employees from Smith
Barney, and Morgan Stanley said in a letter that it will likely
be back to request more shares in 2011. 
U.S. Rescue 
Morgan Stanley last month reported its largest quarterly
profit since 2007, as it recovers from the financial crisis that
included a $10 billion bailout from the government in 2008 and
the bank&#8217;s first annual per-share loss in 2009. Last year, it
repaid the taxpayer funds and took a controlling stake in a
joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage. 
The firm and competitors remain embroiled in a Securities
and Exchange Commission probe, started at least a year ago,
that&#8217;s examining whether Wall Street misled investors when
selling mortgage-linked securities. 
Gorman said today in an interview after the meeting that
the company hasn&#8217;t received any Wells notices or recent
subpoenas from the SEC and hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the
Department of Justice. Wells notices are issued by regulators to
inform companies of completed investigations that may have
discovered infractions. 
&#8216;Across the Spectrum&#8217; 
The agency has been looking for abuse &#8220;across the
spectrum,&#8221; enforcement chief Robert Khuzami said April 16, when
the SEC sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accusing the company of
fraud in the sale of a collateralized debt obligation. While
federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the market, Morgan Stanley
isn&#8217;t the subject of a formal criminal investigation, a person
familiar with the government&#8217;s review said last week. Goldman
Sachs is contesting the lawsuit. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s operating environment is &#8220;extremely
fluid&#8221; because of regulatory reform legislation being debated
in Congress and &#8220;various industrywide&#8221; regulatory probes,
Gorman said. He said regulators looking into practices from
several years ago is a &#8220;necessary consequence&#8221; of the
financial crisis and is &#8220;appropriate.&#8221; 
The financial industry needs to &#8220;acknowledge the mistakes
that were made in recent years&#8221; and work to regain trust of the
public, Gorman said. 
&#8220;We need to understand why people are so angry at Wall
Street,&#8221; he said. 
Morgan Stanley fell 38 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $26.73 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. The
shares have declined 9.7 percent this year, compared with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index&#8217;s 3.6 percent gain.

Pfizer Inc. will close eight
manufacturing plants and scale back operations at six other
sites worldwide, eliminating 6,000 jobs as part of a previously
announced plan to trim its workforce. 
The drugmaker plans to shut manufacturing operations over
the next five years at plants in Puerto Rico, Ireland, and
Rouses Point, New York. Operations at plants in Germany,
Ireland, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and U.S. will be cut back, the
New York-based company said in a statement today. 
The cuts are part of the more than 19,000 jobs Pfizer said
it would eliminate after its $68 billion acquisition last year
of Wyeth. Pfizer said it has spent the past six months reviewing
how to reduce the combined company&#8217;s manufacturing operations. 
Pfizer is slashing costs as it braces to lose patent
protection next year on the company&#8217;s top-selling Lipitor
cholesterol pill, which generated about a quarter of Pfizer&#8217;s
sales last year. The drugmaker has eliminated 48,000 positions,
or 38 percent of its total workforce, over the past six years. 
Pfizer fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $15.81 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its lowest price
since Aug. 14. 
The plants that will be closed include those in Caguas,
Puerto Rico; Carolina, Puerto Rico; Dublin; Loughbeg, Ireland;
Shanbally, Ireland; Rouses Point, New York; Richmond, Virginia;
and Pearl River, New York. 
Wyeth said in 2005 that it would sell the Rouses Point,
site. Research operations in Pearl River and Richmond won&#8217;t be
affected by the manufacturing cuts, Pfizer said. 
Operations will be downsized in Guayama, Puerto Rico;
Newbridge, Ireland; Andover, Massachusetts; Sanford, North
Carolina; Havant, U.K.; and Illertissen, Germany. 
&#8220;The restructuring of our global plant network is critical
to our efforts to remain competitive so that we can continue to
meet patient needs and expand the access and affordability of
our medicines,&#8221; said Pfizer&#8217;s head of manufacturing Nat Ricciardi in the statement.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, said its plan to drill a deep-water oil
well in the Gulf of Mexico called Hadrian has been delayed by a
U.S. moratorium on offshore drilling permits. 
Exxon moved a rig to a site in 6,941 feet (2,116 meters) of
water in anticipation of drilling the well before the moratorium
was imposed earlier this month, halting any additional work on
the project, said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based company. 
A U.S. Interior Department report issued today that
included Hadrian in a list of deep-water projects that began in
the week ended May 17 may have been referring to Exxon&#8217;s
preparatory work, Jeffers said. The moratorium on new permits
was declared after an April 20 explosion and fire aboard a
Transocean Ltd. rig that killed 11 workers and triggered subsea
oil leaks. 
Caryl Fagot, a spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s Minerals
Management Service, which produced today&#8217;s report, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a telephone message seeking comment. 
The agency&#8217;s weekly deep-water activity report also showed
Newfield Exploration Co. and ATP Oil  Gas Corp. began drilling
deep-water oil wells in the Gulf in the past week. 
Pyranees Drilling 
Keith Schmidt, a spokesman for Newfield, confirmed drilling
has begun on a well at the company&#8217;s Pyranees project in 2,095
feet of water. Isabel Plume, an ATP spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment on
the deep-water report. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Exxon dropped 48 cents to $62.79 as of 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Newfield fell
$1.07, or 2 percent, to $51.44. ATP declined 42 cents to $14.71
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
There are at least 37 deep-water drilling projects
operating in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico, the report
showed. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled
explorer, is overseeing the deepest, Chinook, in 8,850 feet of
water. 
BP Plc, the London-based company that was leasing the rig
that exploded, burned and sank last month, is drilling a relief
well to halt leaks in the one damaged in the disaster that
claimed 11 lives. It&#8217;s BP&#8217;s only active deep-water project,
according to the report.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. shareholders
rejected a proposal to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer currently held by Jamie Dimon, who gave
investors an upbeat outlook on the U.S. economy. 
The resolution to separate the positions failed to pass
with about 34 percent of the vote, according to a preliminary
tally given to investors at today&#8217;s annual meeting in New York.
All members of the board standing for election received at least
89 percent of the vote, said General Counsel Stephen Cutler.
More than a dozen homeowners with Chase mortgages and consumer
advocates, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson appealed to Dimon to
do more for borrowers seeking loan modifications. 
Dimon, 54, who has led the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets and its board for more than four years, told shareholders
&#8220;there&#8217;s a chance down the road&#8221; that the lender would
reinstate a stock-buyback program. When asked whether the firm
would consider repurchasing shares, he said &#8220;not quite yet.&#8221;
He said he hoped to reinstate the quarterly dividend, which was
cut to 5 cents in 2009, at 30 percent to 40 percent of earnings. 
&#8220;The economy is growing as we speak,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think
it&#8217;s better to wait when things are stable so we can pay a
dividend you can count on.&#8221; It was the company&#8217;s first public
meeting since posting a 55 percent increase in net income for
the first quarter to $3.33 billion. 
Votes on Proposals 
Shareholders also approved a resolution for an advisory
vote on executive compensation by more than 95 percent. They
backed by 54 percent a measure allowing investors to take
actions outside of the public-meeting process if they have the
written consent of a majority of shares outstanding. 
A proposal allowing anyone with at least 10 percent of
outstanding common stock to call shareholder meetings lost while
attracting 44 percent of the vote. Another proposal seeking more
detailed derivatives disclosures and stricter collateral
requirements won about 34 percent of the vote. 
&#8220;We already do substantially some of the things you&#8217;re
talking about, not all of them, but some of them,&#8221; Dimon told
Sister Barbara Aires, who spoke on behalf of the groups of nuns
and priests who submitted the derivatives proposal. Aires said
in an interview that the same proposal received similar support
from shareholders at Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Bank of America Corp. 
About two dozen borrowers came to the meeting and appealed
for help on their home loans. Dimon referred them to mortgage
specialists sitting outside to answer questions about specific
foreclosure cases and pending modifications. 
&#8220;This is a government program, so it&#8217;s not always up to
JPMorgan&#8221; in deciding who qualifies and who doesn&#8217;t for the
Home Affordable Modification Program, Dimon said.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., fighting a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the company of
misleading investors, is trying to persuade more Americans to
trust the firm with their retirement funds. 
The New York-based company is promoting alternative asset
funds and designing target-date funds that provide guaranteed
income to grab a bigger piece of the $2.7 trillion 401(k)
market, said Bill McDermott, a managing director at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management and head of its defined-contribution
business. 
&#8220;We understand risk and we understand asset allocation,&#8221;
said McDermott, who joined the firm in February to strengthen
its retirement-plan products and marketing. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking to
leverage that for the 401(k) market.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s 401(k) plan assets totaled $17.5 billion as of
March 31, according to the company. Fidelity Investments, the
largest 401(k) asset manager, had $347.8 billion as of December
31. Assets in 401(k) plans are estimated to increase 41 percent,
to $3.8 trillion, by the end of 2014, according to data from
Cerulli Associates in Boston. 
Goldman and BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s largest asset
manager, don&#8217;t administer retirement plans and have been seeking
more 401(k) business. The business has been dominated by firms
such as Boston-based Fidelity and Vanguard Group, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, which administer plans as well as
manage assets.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, agreed to pay VirnetX Holding Corp. $200 million
and license technology to communicate privately over the
Internet, ending a patent dispute. 
&#8220;We believe that this successful resolution of our
litigation with Microsoft will allow us to focus on the upcoming
pilot system&#8221; for a virtual private network, Chief Executive
Officer Kendall Larsen said yesterday in a statement. 
VirnetX, which won a $105.8 million jury verdict in its
patent-infringement lawsuit in March, was seeking a court order
to block Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft from continuing to
use the technology in its Windows operating system and
Communications Server. The jury award also could have been
tripled by the court&#8217;s judge. 
Microsoft argued at trial that the patents were valued at
no more than $15 million. Investors bet the patents were worth
more, driving Scotts Valley, California-based VirnetX&#8217;s share
price up almost 300 percent in the past 12 months. VirnetX had a
market value of $267.9 million, based on the May 14 price. 
VirnetX had been public in its desire to be bought to
resolve the dispute. The agreement in which it obtained the
patents from defense contractor SAIC Inc. included a provision
that SAIC would get 10 percent of any proceeds if VirnetX were
acquired by Microsoft, according to a company regulatory filing. 
The patents relate to use of a domain-name service to set
up virtual private networks, through which a website owner can
interact with a customer in a secure way or an employee can work
at home and access a company&#8217;s files. The technology stemmed
from work performed for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to
develop secure communications, VirnetX said. 
After winning the trial, VirnetX filed another lawsuit
against Microsoft in the same court, arguing that Windows 7 also
infringed the patent. 
The Windows 7 case is VirnetX v. Microsoft Corp., 10cv94,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). The
older case is VirnetX Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 07cv80, in the
same court. 
Hyundai Motor Wins Reversal of $34 Million Patent Verdict 
Hyundai Motor Co. won its appeal of a $34 million verdict
that said South Korea&#8217;s largest automaker infringed a Texas
company&#8217;s patent for computerizing the sale of car parts. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit yesterday
said Orion IP LLC&#8217;s patent was invalid and vacated the verdict.
The opinion was posted on the court&#8217;s website. 
&#8220;There is insufficient evidence to support the jury&#8217;s
verdict&#8221; in Orion&#8217;s favor on the question of validity, the
three-judge court panel ruled. 
Orion, a patent-licensing firm based in Longview, Texas,
had sued 20 automakers, claiming infringement of a patent for a
way to help a salesperson select auto parts without relying on
catalogs or order forms. The other auto companies settled before
the 2007 trial in Tyler, Texas. 
Hyundai argued that companies other than Orion had come up
with the idea of electronic parts catalogs in 1987, and the
patented computer-assisted system a year later wasn&#8217;t different
enough to be considered a new invention. The Federal Circuit
agreed. 
Following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Leonard Davis
ordered Seoul-based Hyundai to pay a 2 percent royalty on parts
revenue generated through its website or dealer communication
system after June 19, 2007. 
The case is Orion IP LLC V. Hyundai Motor America, 2009-
1130, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Orion IP LLC v. Mercedes-
Benz USA LLC, 05cv322, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas (Tyler). 
Sanofi-Aventis Wins Patent Case Against Mylan in Delaware Ruling 
Mylan Pharmaceutical Inc. extended-release bladder tablets
will infringe on asserted claims of a patent held by Sanofi-
Aventis known as the 491 patent, according to May 14 decision by
a federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. 
The May 14 decision concerned Mylan&#8217;s proposed 10 mg
extended release alfuzosin hydrochloride tablets. The drug is an
alpha1-blocker that relaxes the smooth muscle in the lower
urinary tract, including bladder neck and prostate, to treat
illnesses of the prostate. 
The 491 patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
office April 28, 1987, to Synthelabo, a predecessor of Sanofi-
Aventis, the court wrote in the decision. 
Mylan filed its application in 2007. The court found that
Sanofi-Aventis showed by weight of the evidence that Mylan
&#8220;literally infringes&#8221; the asserted claims of the 491 patent. 
The case is In re Alfuzosin Hydrochloride Patent
Litigation, 08-md-1941, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). 
Chrysler Seeks to Block Imports of China&#8217;s Jeepzter Knockoff 
Chrysler Group, the U.S. automaker run by Fiat Spa, filed a
trade complaint to block U.S. imports of the Jeepzter, a car it
calls a knockoff of its Jeep off-road vehicle. 
Chrysler filed a complaint May 14 with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington against Xingyue
Group Co., claiming the Chinese company is making a vehicle that
copies a patented design for the Jeep Hurricane. The Hurricane,
shown as a concept car by Chrysler at the 2005 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit, was never mass produced. 
The Jeepzter &#8220;is the same or substantially the same to the
eye of the ordinary observer as the ornamental design&#8221; covered
by the patent, Chrysler said in the complaint. 
Chrysler, whose U.S. sales plummeted 36 percent last year,
is refreshing models including the Jeep Grand Cherokee as part
of a turnaround of its Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands. 
Chrysler also filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit in
federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 11 against
three companies selling Jeepzters in the U.S. That case claims
the companies are selling vehicles that copy the grille design
of the Jeep Wrangler. 
Noel Farbman, president of USA Wholesale Scooters in
Florida, said he took ads for the Jeepzter off his website as
soon as he heard of the lawsuit. He said he sold three of the
vehicles before learning of Chrysler&#8217;s complaint. 
Wade Liu, manager of Excalibur Motor Sports in Chino,
California, one of the companies named in the ITC complaint,
said he hadn&#8217;t yet received any of the Jeepzters and planned to
pull ads off his company&#8217;s website. 
Also named in the ITC case were three other businesses in
Tennessee, Texas and North Carolina that advertised the
vehicles, as well as importers connected to Xingyue. Efforts to
reach Xingyue&#8217;s U.S. offices in California were unsuccessful. 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Automotive
Vehicles and Designs Thereof, 2734. The civil suit is Chrysler
Group LLC v. USA Wholesale Scooters Inc., 10cv60774, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).

Coach Reaches Settlement in Suit on Alleged Design Infringement 
Coach Inc. said it settled a copyright infringement suit

defendant, was filed in federal court in New York. Terms of the
settlement are confidential, according to a statement released

Cable Companies Lose at High Court on Must-Carry Rule 
The U.S. Supreme Court, refusing to reconsider a
longstanding cable industry complaint, left intact a federal
requirement that providers include local broadcast stations in
their channel lineups. 
The high court yesterday rejected an appeal from New York-
area cable provider Cablevision Systems Corp., which objected on
free-speech grounds to a requirement that it make a local
station available to customers on Long Island. 
The appeal sought to overturn 1994 and 1997 Supreme Court
decisions that upheld the must-carry rule, which Congress
enacted in 1992 to protect the broadcasting industry from the
growing power of cable TV networks. Cablevision, backed by Time
Warner Cable Inc. and an industry trade group, said the
rationale behind the must-carry rule no longer exists, in part
because satellite services have captured more of the TV market. 
The issue is pitting the cable industry and some program
providers against broadcasters and the Obama administration,
which is defending the must-carry requirements. 
In urging the high court not to hear the case, U.S.
Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued that cable systems now have
far greater channel capacity than they did in the 1990s. 
The case is Cablevision Systems v. FCC, 09-901, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington).

Morgan Stanley co-chief global
economist Joachim Fels said there&#8217;s a risk of some nations
eventually breaking away from the 16-member euro region should
the response to the debt crisis lead to &#8220;fiscal instability&#8221;
and sustained pressure on the currency. 
If there&#8217;s &#8220;further weakness and a rise in inflation
pressures, then some of the more stability-minded European
countries might decide to break away,&#8221; Fels told Bloomberg
Television in an interview from London today. &#8220;Clearly that&#8217;s a
long-term story, not a story for now.&#8221; 
The euro remained close to a four-year low against the
dollar today, partly on concern that the almost $1 trillion aid
package European Union ministers agreed to last week won&#8217;t keep
the fiscal crisis from spreading. The EU today transferred 14.5
billion euros ($18 billion) to Greece, the first installment to
help restore investor confidence and prevent a sovereign
default. 
The euro fell as much as 0.7 percent today to $1.2315 and
was little changed at $1.2420 at 12:16 p.m. in London. 
Greece has pledged to implement austerity measures of
almost 14 percent of gross domestic product in exchange for the
rescue funds that EU officials hoped would stem declines in the
euro and stop the crisis from spreading to other countries such
as Spain and Portugal. Luxembourg&#8217;s Jean-Claude Juncker, who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said today that
there are &#8220;good reasons to believe&#8221; Greece is on the right
path. 
Still, Fels said that the rescue package may &#8220;create more
emergencies&#8221; over the medium term. If governments know that
there&#8217;s a &#8220;fund to bail them out eventually,&#8221; they&#8217;ll &#8220;pursue
a more expansionary fiscal policy,&#8221; he said. 
Europe is on a &#8220;slippery slope now toward more fiscal
instability,&#8221; he said. 
Spain and Portugal this month announced additional budget
cuts to tame the region&#8217;s third- and fourth-biggest deficits
after their bonds plunged. 
&#8220;What I am worried about is that those countries that are
tightening fiscal policy account for less than 20 percent of
euro-area GDP,&#8221; Fels said. &#8220;I think we have to look at the
large countries in the core, especially France and Germany,
where I see no signs whatsoever of fiscal tightening and these
countries account for more than half of euro-area GDP.&#8221;

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks to sell
its Australian service stations after a proposed A$300 million
($262 million) deal with Caltex Australia Ltd. was blocked by a
regulator. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not our business model,&#8221; Exxon Mobil Australia
Chairman John Dashwood said in an interview in Brisbane today.
&#8220;I guess the distinction I make is, are you an oil and gas
company or are you a groceries company? The industry has changed
to the point where the two meld, and some have used the shop to
move fuel. We&#8217;re not in the business of being a shop.&#8221; 
The deal to buy 300 filling stations would have increased
Caltex&#8217; ability to compete for fuel sales with BP Plc and
supermarket chains Woolworths Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd.&#8217;s Coles.
Exxon Mobil Australia wants to focus on natural-gas projects,
with plans to spend &#8220;many billions of dollars&#8221; in Australia
and Papua New Guinea in three to five years, Dashwood said. 
The biggest U.S. energy company is operator of a $15
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea and is
a partner in the $38 billion Gorgon venture in Australia led by
Chevron Corp. Exxon is also developing the Turrum and Kipper gas
ventures, which it estimates will cost A$3 billion. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a substantial amount relative to what we&#8217;ve been
investing here&#8221; over the past five years, Dashwood said,
declining to give a specific figure for the company&#8217;s spending
in Australia. &#8220;It&#8217;s a re-energizing of the organization.&#8221; 
Kipper, Turrum 
Exxon aims to decide in 2010 how to develop the Scarborough
gas field 300 kilometers (185 miles) off the coast of Western
Australia, he said. The project is a joint venture with BHP
Billiton Ltd. 
The budgets and schedules for Turrum and Kipper off
southeastern Australia are &#8220;under review,&#8221; partner BHP
Billiton said in April. Santos Ltd., which owns 35 percent of
Kipper, said this month that first gas from the project has been
delayed until the second half of 2011 due to &#8220;design issues.&#8221; 
While the timeline has &#8220;probably shifted a little bit,&#8221;
Exxon has not strayed from its 2011 target, Dashwood said today
on the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and
Exploration Association conference. 
Caltex Australia, the nation&#8217;s biggest oil refiner,
scrapped plans to buy Exxon Mobil&#8217;s filling stations after the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission opposed a
transaction that would have given the company an estimated 22
percent of the country&#8217;s branded fuel market. The regulator said
in December it was concerned the deal would lead to higher
prices. 
&#8220;We jointly decided we wouldn&#8217;t proceed with that deal,&#8221;
Dashwood said. &#8220;In the meantime we&#8217;ve got to operate those
facilities. We&#8217;ll see where commercial discussions take us.&#8221; 
He declined to reveal the potential buyers.

Microsoft Corp. filed two lawsuits to
combat what it says is a previously unknown form of pay-per-
click fraud on its adCenter network that has cost advertisers
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
The company alleged that RedOrbit Inc., a Texas operator of
a website about science-related topics, its president and
unidentified defendants have used technical measures to make
invalid ad clicks appear to have originated from legitimate
sources, according to a Microsoft statement. 
With click fraud, a company inflates the number of times an
ad is clicked on, often boosting advertising costs for a
competitor. In some cases, a website operator uses the technique
to increase its own revenue. Microsoft said RedOrbit&#8217;s actions
represent &#8220;click laundering,&#8221; a form of the practice designed
to evade fraud detection systems. 
&#8220;These are indications of the increasing sophistication&#8221;
of click fraud, said Jim Jansen, an associate professor of
information sciences at Penn State in University Park,
Pennsylvania. &#8220;It highlights that the ad platforms cannot get
complacent.&#8221; 
In the past, advertisers have sued companies, such as
Google Inc., that make money based on the number of times Web
users interact with online advertisements. Google, the most-used
Internet search engine, agreed in 2006 to pay $90 million to
settle a lawsuit with companies that said they paid for clicks
on ads that had no chance of generating sales. 
&#8216;Best Defense&#8217; 
Microsoft&#8217;s legal moves suggest Internet companies are
taking a more proactive role in cracking down on click fraud,
said Laurence Pulgram, a lawyer at Fenwick  West in San
Francisco. 
&#8220;This is a case of the search engine deciding the best
defense is a good offense, so the advertisers won&#8217;t be blaming
them,&#8221; Pulgram said. 
Microsoft said investigators uncovered the fraud following
&#8220;dramatic and irregular growth in click traffic&#8221; on two sites
within its adCenter network. 
RedOrbit.com click traffic increased from 75 clicks a day
to 10,000 clicks over a three-month period, according to one of
two complaints filed in federal court in Seattle by the Redmond,
Washington-based company, the world&#8217;s largest software maker. 
&#8220;It is RedOrbit&#8217;s policy not to comment on pending
litigation,&#8221; said Eric Ralls, founder of RedOrbit, listed as
the defendant in one of the lawsuits. &#8220;However, we do not, nor
have we ever, engaged, assisted in, or condoned click fraud. We
are disappointed that Microsoft has made these completely
baseless allegations, and intend to defend against them
vigorously.&#8221; 
Mask the Masking? 
Richard Boscovich, a senior attorney with Microsoft, says
Ralls figured out how to trick adCenter into making clicks that
weren&#8217;t valid look as though they had come from a legitimate
site. 
&#8220;We found that he&#8217;d done something that was thought to be
technically unfeasible,&#8221; Boscovich said. While many websites
have used methods to mask the true source of traffic, &#8220;he was
able to mask the fact that he was masking.&#8221; 
Google said it has taken steps to root out click fraud,
including in cases where the traffic is automated. 
&#8220;We design our systems to catch bot-related attacks,&#8221;
said Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
based Google. &#8220;Because a significant amount of malicious
traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds
of attacks.&#8221; 
The cases are Microsoft v. Eric Ralls, 10-818, and
Microsoft v. John Does, 10-820, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington (Seattle).

The move by General Electric Co. and
several Wall Street banks to salvage a Chicago lender with White
House ties prompted Republicans to demand that the Obama
administration answer questions about any role it may have
played in the rescue. 
ShoreBank Corp., which needs about $200 million in
additional capital to stave off regulators, also is receiving
help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., the Chicago Tribune
reported. Representative Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican
on the House Financial Services Committee, said they were doing
so to gain favor with the administration. 
&#8220;Some believe that ShoreBank was really saved because of an
assumption that high-ranking officials in the Obama
administration favored a bailout of this failing institution
with deep political ties,&#8221; Bachus, an Alabama lawmaker, said in
a letter he sent to President Barack Obama. 
General Electric said yesterday it&#8217;s investing $20 million
in the community bank, which is based on Chicago&#8217;s South Side
and has long-standing ties to the president. After Obama was
elected, former ShoreBank executive Robert Weissbourd served on
the president-elect&#8217;s transition team. 
&#8220;There is no way a bank without ShoreBank&#8217;s political
connections would receive this kind of attention,&#8221; Bachus said
in a statement. 
White House Question 
Administration officials haven&#8217;t met with ShoreBank about
its efforts to raise capital nor asked other lenders to provide
it with &#8220;financial assistance,&#8221; Amy Brundage, a White House
spokeswoman, said in a statement. 
The bank, a 1970s-era pioneer in lending to low-income
neighborhoods, has raised more than its target of $125 million
in private capital, said Brian Berg, a ShoreBank spokesman. The
remaining money may come from government funds, he said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re still looking into what Bachus is asking for,&#8221;
Berg said. 
Bachus&#8217;s letter to the president also was signed by
Republican Representative Judy Biggert of Illinois. They said it
is unfair for a &#8220;politically connected hometown bank&#8221; to get
assistance as others are closed by regulators. 
The Republicans urged the White House to release all
communication records that may exist between the administration
and financial executives involved in helping ShoreBank. 
&#8220;The investment is consistent with our focus on small- and
medium-sized businesses, and it is a valuable community bank,&#8221;
GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson said yesterday. GE Capital, the
Stamford, Connecticut-based unit of GE, makes loans to
businesses through its commercial lending and leasing division. 
Goldman&#8217;s Role 
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment. 
Goldman has agreed to invest $20 million in ShoreBank and
never had contact from the White House on the matter, said a
person familiar with Goldman&#8217;s involvement. The firm&#8217;s
connections were through Ellen Seidman, who is on ShoreBank&#8217;s
board and is a founding member of the advisory council of a
Goldman small-business initiative, as well as former U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and Sheila Bair,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the person
said.

Roy Bostock, the Morgan Stanley
director whose re-election was opposed by proxy advisory groups,
received the highest percentage of negative shareholder votes
among directors elected at the annual meeting. 
Bostock, the chairman of Yahoo! Inc., faced opposition from
35 percent of shareholders&#8217; votes yesterday, the New York-based
firm said today in a regulatory filing. Last year, about 29
percent of shares were voted against his re-election. 
About 27 percent of shareholders&#8217; votes supported a
proposal that would have required the company&#8217;s chairman be an
independent director who hasn&#8217;t previously served as an
executive officer of the company, the bank said. Current
Chairman John Mack, 65, was also chief executive officer until
this year, when James Gorman, 51, took over. 
Shareholders approved all management proposals and rejected
all measures proposed by shareholders at the meeting in
Purchase, New York. 
Bostock&#8217;s re-election was opposed by Glass Lewis and
RiskMetrics because he serves on the nominating and governance
committee even though his son-in-law, Daniel Waters, is co-CEO
of FrontPoint Partners, an asset-management division of Morgan
Stanley. Bostock has served on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s board since
2005. 
About 35 percent of shares were voted against approving 38
million additional shares to be used for equity-based
compensation during the next year. That compares with 36 percent
that were voted against approving 25 million shares at last
year&#8217;s meeting.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Global
Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said that while Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has
eased the euro&#8217;s &#8220;overvaluation,&#8221; policy makers may have to
take coordinated steps to shore up the currency. 
&#8220;People need to remember that for the past couple of years
the euro&#8217;s been very expensive,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill told Bloomberg Radio
from London today. Still, the euro&#8217;s recent slide indicates
expectations that monetary union could unravel, &#8220;so, there
needs to be something done by European policy makers to
stabilize the euro in the near future,&#8221; he said. 
The euro has shed 15 percent against the dollar this year
on concern a Greek fiscal crisis will spread across the 16-
member currency region. While European leaders last week pledged
a rescue package worth almost $1 trillion and the European
Central Bank started purchasing government bonds, investors
remain concerned about nations&#8217; ability to push down deficits. 
The euro remained near a four-year low against the dollar
today, trading at $1.2292 at 1:45 p.m. in London. It dropped as
low as $1.2144 today, the lowest level since April 17, 2006. 
Greece on May 18 received the first installment of a
European Union aid package allowing it pay back 8.5 billion
euros of bond maturing today and avoid default. The government
pledged 30 billion euros of budget cuts to secure the aid and
pledged to reduce the budget gap to 8.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 13.6 percent in 2009.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. racked up
trading profits for itself every day last quarter. Clients who
followed the firm&#8217;s investment advice fared far worse. 
Seven of the investment bank&#8217;s nine &#8220;recommended top
trades for 2010&#8221; have been money losers for investors who
adopted the New York-based firm&#8217;s advice, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from a Goldman Sachs research note sent
yesterday. Clients who used the tips lost 14 percent buying the
Polish zloty versus the Japanese yen, 9.4 percent buying
Chinese stocks in Hong Kong and 9.8 percent trading the British
pound against the New Zealand dollar. 
The struggles for analysts at Goldman Sachs, which is 
fighting a fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the
company of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked security, 
show the difficulty of predicting market movements as widening 
budget deficits, a fragile global economic recovery and tighter
financial regulations increase volatility. Stock and currency
fluctuations rose to the highest in a year this month as Europe
pledged about $1 trillion to stop a debt crisis in the region. 
&#8220;This says that Goldman&#8217;s guys are only human,&#8221; said Axel Merk, who oversees $500 million as president and chief
investment officer of Merk Investments LLC in Palo Alto,
California. &#8220;No one is always right. There are a lot of cross
currents in this market.&#8221; 
Gia Moron, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
China&#8217;s Bear Market 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading profits come from capturing bid-
offer spreads when its traders act as intermediaries for
clients, Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s president and chief operating
officer, said last week in New York. Proprietary trading isn&#8217;t a
main driver of earnings, he said. 
The trade advice for customers is distributed by Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s global markets economic research group. It tracks the
performance of the trades in a daily research note. The time
period of the recommendations is 12 months. 
The performance this year is a reversal from 2009, when
nine of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 11 trading recommendations made money.
Investors saw a 22 percent return owning Chinese stocks and a 12
percent gain buying the British pound versus the dollar,
according to a Goldman Sachs note on Dec. 1. 
Goldman Sachs analysts made eight trade recommendations for
this year in December, including telling clients to buy the
British pound against the New Zealand dollar. On April 1,
Goldman Sachs added a ninth &#8220;top&#8221; trade, telling clients to
buy Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong and predicting the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index would rise 19 percent to 15,000. 
Tough Analysis 
Since then, the gauge has slid 9.4 percent to 11,426.18.
The Shanghai Composite index has entered a bear market, losing
about 21 percent this year. That&#8217;s the third biggest decline in
the world after Greece and Cyprus. The decline accelerated this
month on concern Greece, Spain and Portugal will struggle to
finance their budget deficits and dismantle the euro. 
The Chinese stock recommendation was made by a group led by
Dominic Wilson, a senior Goldman Sachs economist in New York.
Wilson cited inexpensive valuations and &#8220;robust&#8221; economic
growth. He also said investors have already factored in the risk
of higher interest rates in China. 
Wilson wasn&#8217;t available to comment because he was out of
the office traveling, according to an e-mail. 
Exit Calls 
&#8220;Emerging markets appear superior to the developed world,
but the market isn&#8217;t trading that relationship,&#8221; said Eric Fine, who manages Van Eck Associates Corp.&#8217;s G-175 Strategies
emerging-market hedge fund. &#8220;It may be that some assets are
mispriced, but if the market starts to discount the end point of
the game, such as the collapse of the euro, it&#8217;s not that
mispriced.&#8221; 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs recommended investors exit two
trades in February, one involving interest-rate swap rates in
the U.K. and another advising clients to buy credit-default
swaps in Spain and sell similar contracts in Ireland. The first
trade had a potential loss of 24 basis points and the other had
a return of 2.9 percent, according to figures issued in the
appendix of the research note in February. 
Owning currencies that are tied to growth is the only
remaining trade that has increased in value this year, according
to Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs FX Growth Index
has climbed 3.4 percent since the firm made the recommendation
in December. 
Betting on Markets 
Goldman Sachs makes more money from trading than any other
Wall Street firm. In the first quarter, the bank&#8217;s $7.39 billion
in revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities
dwarfed the $5.52 billion made by its closest rival, Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. In equities, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s $2.35 billion in revenue was about 50 percent higher
than its nearest competitor. 
Cohn told investors at a May 11 conference in New York that
the firm lost money on only 11 days in the last 12 months. He
said that uncanny streak of success refutes suspicions that the
bank depends on proprietary bets with its own money. 
&#8220;It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time,&#8221; Cohn said.
Instead, he said the &#8220;simple answer&#8221; is that the firm makes
money by capturing bid-offer spreads when acting as an
intermediary for client trades. 
Goldman Sachs executives have grappled before with
questions about whether they&#8217;re better at making money for the
firm than for their clients, according to an internal e-mail
dated Sept. 26, 2007, that was released by a U.S. Senate
subcommittee last month. 
U.S. Lawsuit 
The e-mail to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein from
Peter Kraus, who was then co-head of the company&#8217;s investment-
management division, explains that individual investors, unlike
institutional clients, occasionally make &#8220;comments like ur good
at making money for urself but not us.&#8221; 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit
against Goldman on April 16 accusing the company of misleading
investors in a mortgage-linked asset. Goldman denies those
allegations and said it will fight the charges.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit
Suisse Group Inc. cut profit and share-price estimates for
Chinese property companies, citing a government clampdown on
speculation to avoid asset bubbles. 
Goldman Sachs, ranked second for Asian property coverage by
Institutional Investor magazine, lowered its 2010 net income
estimates by an average 13 percent and reduced earnings
forecasts for the next two years by 25 percent, analysts led by
Yi Wang wrote in a report today. Credit Suisse pared earnings-
per-share estimates by as much as 15 percent for 2010 and 20
percent for 2011. 
The MSCI China Real Estate Index&#8217;s 16 companies have
slumped an average 23 percent this year as the central bank
raised bank reserve requirements three times, while the
government raised down payment requirements for second homes and
banned loans for third homes. The slump in property stocks
outpaced the 9.5 percent drop in the broader MSCI China Index
that tracks mostly Hong Kong-traded stocks. The brokerages also
slashed share-price targets by as much as 57 percent. 
&#8220;In view of the revised tightening measures since mid-
April, we turn more cautious on the property sector,
particularly on transaction volumes for the remainder of the
year,&#8221; Credit Suisse analysts led by Jinsong Du wrote in a
report yesterday. 
Falling Transactions 
Property transaction volumes will tumble by about 15
percent on average this year from 2009, the brokerage estimated,
keeping an earlier forecast that prices will slump 30 percent
from current levels. There are signs the government may &#8220;adopt
a more cautious stance on tightening&#8221; amid the European
sovereign-debt crisis, according to the report. 
China&#8217;s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has slid 21
percent this year, Asia&#8217;s worst performer. 
Goldman Sachs predicted volumes will fall 40 percent
between May and December from a year earlier, while home prices
will fall as much as 30 percent from current levels, according
to a note today. 
&#8220;A number of developers with funding gaps may face
refinancing issues if banks tighten credit to developers
further,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &#8220;We suggest
investors avoid such secondary real estate brokers due to their
high leverage to transaction volumes.&#8221; 
Guangzhou RF, Sino-Ocean 
Sales of new homes in Shanghai fell to a five-year low last
week as tightening measures took effect, property consultant
Shanghai UWin Real Estate Information Services Co. said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Sales from May 10 to May 16
fell 16 percent to 60,000 square meters from the week before,
the lowest level for the same period since 2005. 
Goldman Sachs cut its ratings for Guangzhou RF Properties
Co., Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., Sino-Ocean Land Holdings
Ltd. and Yanlord Land Group Ltd. to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; It
downgraded IFM Investments Ltd., Shanghai Forte Land Co. and
Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Holdings Co. to &#8220;sell&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; while upgrading China Resources Land Ltd. to
&#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;sell.&#8221; 
Credit Suisse lowered its recommendation for Greentown
China Holdings Ltd. to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
downgraded Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. and Hopson
Development Holdings Ltd. to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
Standard Chartered Bank also downgraded Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. and Sino Land Co. today to &#8220;in-line&#8221; from
&#8220;outperform,&#8221; citing a &#8220;less visible outlook&#8221; for Hong
Kong&#8217;s residential prices, according to an e-mailed note by
analyst John Chan. 
Guangzhou RF, the largest developer in the southern
Chinese city, fell 1.9 percent in Hong Kong trading, pacing a
retreat among property stocks. Shimao declined 1.2 percent while
Sino-Ocean Land lost 2.3 percent. Greentown China fell 2.2
percent while Hopson dropped 2.3 percent. Evergrande, China&#8217;s
second-biggest developer by first-quarter sales, tumbled 6.6
percent.

Pfizer Inc. and Celldex Therapeutics
Inc.&#8217;s said 70 percent of patients getting their experimental
brain tumor vaccine were alive without their cancer worsening
about eight months after diagnosis, a study found. 
Cancer typically progresses in about 50 percent of patients
during that time period, said Tom Davis, Celldex&#8217;s chief medical
officer. The finding, involving 40 patients, is from an interim
analysis of a study reported today by the American Society for
Clinical Oncology. The full results will be presented June 5 at
the group&#8217;s annual meeting in Chicago. 
New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
licensed rights to the drug last year from Needham,
Massachusetts-based Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus
royalties. If approved for brain cancer, the vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, said Joseph Pantginis, an analyst with Roth Capital
Partners LLC. 
Some investors may be disappointed because previous,
smaller studies appeared to show a greater benefit with about 90
percent of patients alive without their cancer worsening after
the treatment, called CDX-110, Pantginis said. That may be a
misinterpretation of the data because the studies aren&#8217;t
&#8220;apples-to-apples&#8221; comparisons, he said. 
Celldex fell 8.9 percent to $6.99 at 7:06 p.m. New York
time in extended trading after the close of the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Pfizer fell 13 cents to $15.10 in extended New York
trading. 
More Data Needed 
Further data on the vaccine&#8217;s survival benefit will be
needed to draw definitive conclusions on the treatment, said
Pantginis, who has a &#8216;buy&#8217; rating on Celldex shares. 
&#8220;There might be some disappointment out there because you
have erosion to the progression rate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is still
a positive progression number, but the data are immature.&#8221; 
The treatment is designed to ramp up the body&#8217;s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well, though none of
those indications are in human testing, Celldex said. 
The drug is in the second of three stages of testing
required to get U.S. regulatory approval. Pfizer hasn&#8217;t
announced plans to start final-stage testing. The next step
likely will be a placebo-controlled study looking at about 200
patients worldwide, Davis said. 
In the research, newly diagnosed patients received
injections of CDX-110 along with radiation therapy and Merck 
Co.&#8217;s Temodar until their tumor progressed. All patients
received the experimental treatment, rather than giving the
medicine to half of the participants while the other half
received placebos. 
Final results from 65 patients enrolled in the trial should
be available by year&#8217;s end, Davis said.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall operator, finished restructuring its
$15 billion secured-debt load, clearing an obstacle from its
path out of bankruptcy. 
Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan today approved
a restructuring agreement on a $95 million loan tied to a
Louisiana mall. It&#8217;s the last of the Chicago company&#8217;s secured
debt that needed to be restructured in bankruptcy, Anup Sathy, a
lawyer for General Growth, said in court. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to report, your honor, that our last loan is
done,&#8221; Sathy, an attorney with law firm Kirkland  Ellis, told
the judge. 
Today&#8217;s ruling by Gropper marks a milestone in General
Growth&#8217;s bankruptcy case. The mall operator has spent months
obtaining court approvals for restructuring deals on its secured
debt. 
Gropper said he was &#8220;delighted&#8221; that General Growth and
creditors reached a deal. A unit of Citigroup Inc. represents
holders of the loan, according to court documents. 
&#8220;I think everyone has benefited from the restructurings of
all the loans,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;The company is now on an
entirely different economic footing than when the case
started.&#8221; 
Extended Maturity 
General Growth reached agreements with lenders on a total
of 108 loans worth $15 billion, Sathy said. The debt is tied to
144 properties. The deal approved today, on the Oakwood Center
mall in Gretna, Louisiana, extends the maturity of the loan to
June 1, 2014, according to court papers. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
With agreements on its secured debt in place, General
Growth can now turn its attention to the final phase of its
reorganization: cementing an agreement for new financing
commitments that will fund the company&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy
protection. 
Earlier this month, the company won court approval to move
forward with an investment proposal from Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management LLC, and Pershing
Square Capital Management LP. They have agreed to invest $6.5
billion into the company, subject to higher bids from other
investors. The company plans to seek court approval of the
financing commitments in September, according to court
documents. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Chevron Corp., the energy producer
fighting lawsuits over drilling in Ecuador, must wait until
May 31 before proceeding with a subpoena seeking outtakes from a
movie about oil exploration, a judge ruled. 
Chevron won a court ruling May 6 ordering filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the
San Ramon, California-based company&#8217;s drilling in Ecuador. The
company argued that footage shot for &#8220;Crude: The Real Price of
Oil&#8221; may be relevant in a lawsuit brought by Ecuadorians, in
Chevron&#8217;s arbitration against Ecuador, and in criminal
proceedings in the South American country. 
A Chevron subpoena required Berlinger to surrender his
outtakes by tomorrow. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New
York today granted a 10-day postponement so that Berlinger may
appeal the judge&#8217;s May 6 ruling to the Court of Appeals in New
York. 
Berlinger&#8217;s lawyer, Maura Wogan, argued yesterday that
Kaplan&#8217;s earlier ruling will compromise the rights of other
documentary makers not to disclose unpublished material. 
Also today, lawyers for Berlinger filed an appeal of
Kaplan&#8217;s May 6 order.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s contract
to serve as financial adviser to New York&#8217;s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority won&#8217;t be renewed, according to a person
familiar with the matter. 
The decision to drop Goldman wasn&#8217;t related to a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the firm last
month, accusing it of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked
security, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the decision wasn&#8217;t public. The agency, which carries
8.5 million passengers a day, went through its normal process of
requesting proposals and found a better deal, said the person,
declining to be more specific. 
The advisory assignment with the MTA, one of the biggest
issuers of U.S. municipal debt, is among the market&#8217;s most
lucrative. The MTA, the largest mass-transit system in the U.S.,
plans to sell about $9 billion in bonds for capital projects in
the four years through 2013. 
Goldman became the MTA&#8217;s financial adviser in 2000, and its
contract was renewed in 2004. The firm earned about $21 million
advising the agency on bond issues, based on its fee of 65 cents
per each $1,000 unit sold since early 2002. The agency has
issued more than $31 billion in debt since March 2002, according
to audited financial statements. 
The MTA&#8217;s finance committee will recommend the board change
advisers on May 24, the person said. 
The MTA&#8217;s decision not to renew Goldman&#8217;s contract was
reported earlier by the New York Post and New York Times. 
Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the MTA, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
mall operator reorganizing in bankruptcy, clashed with lenders
on a $400 million loan over whether the company must disclose
now any plan to convert the debt to equity. 
General Growth said in court papers filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the lenders are improperly
demanding to be told if the loan will be converted as part of
the company&#8217;s plan to restructure its debt. 
The Chicago-based mall owner said the request constitutes
&#8220;an attempt to extinguish General Growth&#8217;s bargained-for
contractual rights&#8221; under the loan, which allows the company to
convert some or all of the debt to common stock when it exits
bankruptcy. 
David Feldman, an attorney for Law Debenture Trust Co. of
New York, which represents the lenders, declined to comment. 
In a court filing today, Law Debenture said General
Growth&#8217;s obligation to provide notice was triggered when the
company won approval earlier this month for new financing
commitments from a group of investors. General Growth loses the
option to convert the debt if it doesn&#8217;t provide notice within
one day, the Law Debenture said. 
The lenders specifically negotiated the right to know
whether they will be repaid in cash or stock, Law Debenture said
in its court filing. The lenders will incur &#8220;significant
risks&#8221; if they don&#8217;t know for certain how their debt will be
treated, it said. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper is scheduled to hold a
May 27 hearing on the dispute. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt

Johnson Controls Inc.&#8217;s unsolicited
$1.25 billion offer for bankrupt Visteon Corp.&#8217;s interiors and
electronics businesses may delay the company&#8217;s emergence from
creditor protection, an analyst said. 
Visteon said today in a statement that Johnson Controls,
the largest publicly traded U.S. auto-parts maker, is a
competitor and stands to benefit from introducing &#8220;delay and
complexity&#8221; into its reorganization. The cash offer for the
former Ford Motor Co. unit was made yesterday in a letter,
Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said in a separate statement. 
&#8220;This creates competition for these assets in the court,&#8221;
David Leiker, an analyst with Robert W. Baird, said in e-mailed
comments today. &#8220;At the end of the day, the creditors want to
maximize how much they get from the assets.&#8221; 
Johnson Controls&#8217; offer lacks &#8220;important information and
remains highly conditional and vaguely defined,&#8221; Visteon said.
The two companies have had &#8220;extensive and difficult
experiences&#8221; in prior transactions, Visteon said. 
&#8220;Although Visteon anticipates further dialogue with
Johnson Controls, the company will continue on its path toward
emerging from Chapter 11,&#8221; Visteon said. 
Johnson Controls rose 32 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $28 at
3:09 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 48 percent in the past year. 
Visteon is proposing to give 95 percent of its equity to
company bondholders in return for a $1.25 billion investment.
The arrangement would cancel Visteon&#8217;s current stock, the
company said May 7. 
Bondholder Investment 
Visteon is scheduled to ask the judge overseeing its
bankruptcy to approve the bondholders&#8217; investment on May 24.
That deal is opposed by shareholders, who say Visteon is solvent
enough to pay its debts and return the company to them. 
The company&#8217;s secured lenders also oppose the plan, saying
it would require Visteon to pay about $100 million in
unnecessary fees. 
The combination of the interior and electronics business of
both companies may mean revenue in China exceeding $7 billion,
Johnson Controls said. 
&#8220;Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics businesses would be
an excellent strategic fit with our Automotive Experience
business,&#8221; Johnson Controls Chief Executive Officer Stephen A. Roell said in the statement. &#8220;This acquisition would
significantly expand our automotive interior technologies and
capabilities.&#8221; 
China Presence 
The purchase would give Johnson Controls a larger presence
in China and more offerings in vehicle audio, Leiker wrote in a
report today. Johnson Controls reported $28.5 billion in revenue
with a net loss of $338 million in the fiscal year that ended in
September. About $12 billion of the sales came from its
automotive unit. 
Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics business generated
revenue of $4.1 billion in 2009 and an estimated $230 million in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
said Leiker, who rates Johnson Controls shares &#8220;buy.&#8221; 
The offer represents less than five times the Visteon
businesses&#8217; estimated 2010 Ebitda, he said. 
Johnson Controls said it has approached Van Buren Township,
Michigan-based Visteon twice before about the businesses.
Johnson Controls hired Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz and
JPMorgan Securities to assist in a transaction. 
Visteon, spun off from Ford in 2000, filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, listing assets of $4.58 billion and debt of $5.32
billion in Chapter 11 documents. 
Visteon&#8217;s 7 percent bonds due in 2014 were unchanged today
at 106 cents on the dollar after falling 6.2 percent yesterday,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Johnson Controls Inc., the largest
publicly traded U.S. auto-parts maker, made an unsolicited offer
of $1.25 billion in cash for bankrupt rival Visteon Corp.&#8217;s
interiors and electronics businesses. 
Johnson Controls made the offer yesterday in a letter to
the former Ford Motor Co. unit, the Milwaukee-based parts
company said today in a statement. The combination of the
interior and electronics business of both companies may mean
revenue in China exceeding $7 billion, Johnson Controls said. 
&#8220;We believe that Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics
businesses would be an excellent strategic fit with our
Automotive Experience business,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Stephen A. Roell said in the statement. &#8220;This acquisition would
significantly expand our automotive interior technologies and

The purchase would give JCI a larger presence in China and
more offerings in vehicle audio, David Leiker, an analyst with
Robert W. Baird, wrote in a report today. Johnson Controls

$338 million in the fiscal year that ended in September. About
$12 billion of the sales came from its automotive unit. 
Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics business generated
revenue of $4.1 billion in 2009 and an estimated $230 million in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
said Leiker, who rates Johnson Controls a buy. 
Visteon Responds 
The offer lacks &#8220;important information and remains highly
conditional and vaguely defined,&#8221; Visteon said in a statement
today on PR Newswire. Visteon has had &#8220;extensive and difficult
experiences with Johnson Controls in prior transactions,&#8221; the
company said in the statement. 
&#8220;Although Visteon anticipates further dialogue with
Johnson Controls, the company will continue on its path toward
emerging from Chapter 11,&#8221; Visteon said. 
Visteon is proposing to give 95 percent of its equity to
company bondholders in return for a $1.25 billion investment.
The arrangement would cancel Visteon&#8217;s current stock, the
company said May 7. 
Visteon is scheduled to ask the judge overseeing the
company&#8217;s bankruptcy on May 24 to approve the equity investment
by bondholders. That deal is opposed by shareholders, who say
Visteon is solvent enough to pay off all its debts and return
the company to them. 
The company&#8217;s secured lenders also oppose the bondholder
investment, saying it would require Visteon to pay about
$100 million in unnecessary fees. 
Past Offers 
Johnson Controls said it has approached Van Buren Township,
Michigan-based Visteon twice before about the businesses.
Johnson Controls hired Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz and
JPMorgan Securities to assist in a transaction. 
Visteon, spun off from Ford in 2000, filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, listing assets of $4.58 billion and debt of
$5.32 billion in Chapter 11 documents. 
Johnson Controls rose 88 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $28.56
at 12:38 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 48 percent in the past year. 
Visteon&#8217;s 7 percent bonds due in 2014 were unchanged today
at 106 cents on the dollar after falling 6.2 percent yesterday,

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a southern
Appalachia coal producer, led miners higher on speculation a
sell-off prompted by the European debt crisis was overdone. 
Walter climbed $5.81, or 8.8 percent, to $71.91 as of 11:47

Co., the sixth-biggest U.S. coal producer, jumped $2.07, or 6.9

Each of the coal companies has fallen at least 17 percent

Analysts predict Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. will pay $1 billion or more to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission fraud suit that triggered a 26 percent drop
in the firm&#8217;s stock. Extracting such a record-setting penalty
may be easier said than done. 
When it comes to presenting a settlement for court
approval, the SEC will have to &#8220;have a good explanation and
justification for the number,&#8221; said Donald Langevoort, a former
SEC attorney who teaches securities law at Georgetown University
in Washington. 
Looming over negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street&#8217;s
most profitable investment bank is a reminder from Judge Jed Rakoff that courts can reject settlements -- even when the SEC&#8217;s
adversary is willing and able to pay. Rakoff, a U.S. district
court judge in Manhattan, refused to sign off on a $33 million
accord with Bank of America Corp. in September, noting that the
SEC didn&#8217;t adequately explain how it came up with the dollar
amount. 
A sanction in the range of $1 billion would be hard to
support based on the allegations in the Goldman Sachs complaint,
according to James Coffman, a former SEC enforcement official
who retired in 2007. That figure would be more than double what
any Wall Street firm has agreed to pay as part of a civil
settlement with authorities. 
Under one formula outlined in securities laws, the SEC
could impose a maximum $15 million penalty on the bank to
resolve fraud allegations that it misled buyers of mortgage-
backed investments. That formula has been routinely ignored in
enforcement cases and the SEC will seek more from a firm
depicted as an icon of Wall Street greed at congressional
hearings, Coffman said. 
$1 Billion &#8216;Goalpost&#8217; 
The SEC&#8217;s April 16 complaint accused Goldman Sachs of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation linked
to home loans. The firm concealed the fact that Paulson  Co., a
New York-based hedge fund, picked components of the CDO and bet
it would collapse, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, which
underwrote and marketed the product in 2007, collected about $15
million in fees and Paulson reaped a $1 billion profit. The
remaining investors lost more than $1 billion, according to the
complaint. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has denied wrongdoing. Paulson hasn&#8217;t been
accused of any impropriety and the firm&#8217;s founder, John Paulson,
has said it didn&#8217;t market the transaction or have authority to
select securities in the CDO. 
The $1 billion loss for investors has become the minimum
&#8220;goalpost&#8221; that the public expects the SEC to reach, according
to James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in
Durham, North Carolina. 
&#8216;Whatever it Takes&#8217; 
A settlement would cost the firm &#8220;at least $1 billion, if
not more, which they can easily pay,&#8221; Matt McCormick, an
analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about
$2.8 billion, said in an April 30 Bloomberg Television
interview. The firm &#8220;will do whatever it takes to get this
away, or at least they should.&#8221; 
As the agency&#8217;s first effort to punish a bank for creating
and selling securities tied to subprime mortgages, the Goldman
Sachs case will be dissected by the industry, in Congress and in
the media, Coffman said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of attention paid to this on Capitol
Hill and in the press,&#8221; said Coffman, who predicts Goldman
Sachs will pay about $100 million. The SEC will consider &#8220;how
much public interest there is in sending a strong message and
coming up with a settlement that shows the cops are on the
beat.&#8221; 
SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment. 
Softening Its Tone 
Public statements from Goldman Sachs have softened in the
month since the SEC announced its case as the firm&#8217;s image and
stock price have taken a beating. 
In an April 16 press release, Goldman Sachs called the suit
&#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; and pledged to &#8220;vigorously&#8221; defend
its reputation. Four days later, co-General Counsel Greg Palm
broached the idea of resolving the case, saying on a conference
call with investors that &#8220;you always have the option&#8221; of
settling if both sides forge an agreement. 
In the days following an April 27 Senate hearing where
Goldman Sachs managers were accused of putting the firm&#8217;s
interest ahead of clients, two executives at the firm who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the company was eager to settle
the SEC case in an attempt to contain the reputational damage. 
Ramifications of Accord 
The subject of how much money the firm may pay hasn&#8217;t been
raised during early discussions between the SEC and Goldman 
Sachs, according to a person briefed on the matter, speaking
anonymously because the talks were private. 
Negotiations are more likely to stall over the way the SEC
ultimately describes the firm&#8217;s conduct, rather than the size 
of any fine, said two people familiar with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
thinking. Goldman would resist agreeing to a settlement that
includes an allegation of fraud, because doing so could hurt
the firm&#8217;s business, they said. 
Settling a fraud case would restrict Goldman Sachs and its
employees from managing investment companies registered with the
SEC, unless the bank got an exemption from the agency. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset management unit currently oversees
mutual funds, money-market funds and bond funds, according to
its website. Goldman Sachs would also risk losing its ability to
raise money quickly through securities sales without meeting
certain regulatory burdens. 
The SEC and New York-based Goldman Sachs will have to
litigate if they can&#8217;t agree on an accord. 
&#8216;Pecuniary Gain&#8217; 
The SEC suit cites the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both laws limit their most
severe fines to either $650,000 per violation or the &#8220;pecuniary
gain&#8221; reaped by the defendant. 
SEC investigators don&#8217;t have to follow those limitations if
they can persuade companies to pay more, a majority of agency
commissioners vote to approve the settlement and a judge signs
off on the accord, said former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s basically what the two sides hammer out,&#8221; he said. 
Goldman Sachs argues the $15 million in commissions it
received for putting the CDO together were offset by more than
$90 million the firm lost on its own stake in the transaction. 
ABN Amro Bank NV lost more than $840 million and
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost
most of its $150 million investment, according to the SEC. 
The SEC typically requires defendants in a settlement to
pay a fine and return ill-gotten profits to victims. 
Citigroup&#8217;s 2003 Settlement 
Citigroup Inc. paid $400 million in 2003 to settle SEC and
state allegations that its analysts hyped telecommunications
stocks that its researchers privately thought were
underperformers. 
The SEC said in its complaint that Citigroup made $790
million in revenue from underwriting telecom securities from
1999 through 2001, relying on analysts to &#8220;generate substantial
profits&#8221; for the company&#8217;s investment bankers. 
Citigroup agreed to a $150 million fine, returned $150
million of ill-gotten gains, and paid $100 million to provide
clients with independent research and investor education. 
Bank of America, in the second-biggest agreement between
the SEC and a bank in the past decade, paid $375 million in 2004
to settle claims the company didn&#8217;t disclose that some of its
mutual funds allowed clients to make trades detrimental to other
investors. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America paid a $125
million fine and $250 million in disgorgement. Its fine was 10
times the $12.5 million in revenue the SEC said it received from
one of the hedge funds making improper trades. 
Prudential&#8217;s Choice 
Prudential Securities Inc. agreed in a 1993 settlement
with the SEC and state regulators to pay $371 million in
restitution and fines, and to fully compensate all investors who
lost money in oil, gas and real estate partnerships it sold
without disclosing the risks. Over time the company paid more
than $1 billion to resolve claims dating back to the 1980s. 
Goldman Sachs remains the most profitable firm in Wall
Street history. It earned $13.4 billion in 2009 and an
additional $3.5 billion in the first three months of 2010. 
&#8220;Money hurts but limitations on business can hurt in a lot
more ways and that can be the hurt that keeps on giving,&#8221;
Coffman said.

Coda Automotive, which makes
batteries in China for its electric cars, plans to open a
factory in Ohio as a hedge against a possible rise in the yuan,
Senior Vice President Mark Atkeson said. 
Coda of Santa Monica, California, paired with Tianjin
Lishen Battery Co., majority owned by Chinese energy producer
Cnooc Ltd., to make batteries in Tianjin. Coda also gets auto
parts from a plant in northern China, to be assembled in
California for sale in the U.S. later this year. 
&#8220;We feel in the long-run there is a need for a global
manufacturing base,&#8221; Atkeson told reporters on May 22. One
reason is that &#8220;the renminbi will go up,&#8221; he said, using
another name for the Chinese currency. That would increase the
costs of goods exported to the U.S., he said 
The yuan&#8217;s value has been fixed to about 6.83 to one U.S.
dollar for almost two years, and China is being pressed by
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to let the value of the
currency appreciate to boost domestic demand and control
inflation. Geithner met with Chinese officials in Beijing
yesterday as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. 
Closely held Coda, which has former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson on its advisory board, aims to sell 14,000
electric cars by the end of next year, Atkeson said in an e-mail
exchange on May 23.

Microsoft Corp. is less optimistic
about China as a market than India or Indonesia because of the
country&#8217;s lack of progress in stamping out software piracy,
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. 
&#8220;India is not perfect but the intellectual property
protection in India is far, far better than it would be in
China,&#8221; the head of the world&#8217;s largest software maker said in
an interview in Hanoi, Vietnam, yesterday. &#8220;China is a less
interesting market to us than India, than Indonesia.&#8221; 
Ballmer&#8217;s concerns underscore growing dismay among U.S.
companies toward operating in the world&#8217;s third-largest economy.
Google Inc. in March moved its Chinese service out of the
mainland to avoid censorship rules, and the American Chamber of
Commerce in Beijing said last month its members face an
increasingly difficult regulatory environment. 
China has implemented more than 1,000 measures related to
the protection of intellectual property and the government will
continue such efforts, said Chen Rongkai, a media officer at the
nation&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s effort at strengthening protection of
intellectual property is universally recognized,&#8221; Chen said. 
Lack of progress in protecting intellectual property has
led China, which may overtake the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest
personal-computer market in a year, to generate less revenue for
Microsoft than India and South Korea, Ballmer said. China&#8217;s
gross domestic product is twice the two economies combined.

Morgan Stanley hired Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s David Heaton, an investment banker to fund managers
including Legg Mason Inc., said a person with direct knowledge
of the matter. 
Heaton, 43, will join in August and run investment banking
for asset-management companies, said the person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because Heaton hasn&#8217;t joined the firm
yet. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. 
Heaton has worked on some of the biggest asset-management
deals, helping Merrill Lynch  Co. sell its investment
management unit to BlackRock Inc. in 2006 and helping Legg
Mason, the Baltimore-based money manager, raise capital from
investors including KKR  Co. in 2008. 
Heaton will be offering merger and financing advice to fund
management companies, many of whom rely on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
18,000-strong retail brokerage venture to distribute their
investment products. Before joining Deutsche Bank, Heaton spent
almost two decades at Merrill Lynch, formerly the largest retail
brokerage. 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney eclipsed Merrill Lynch last
year when it was created as a joint venture of Morgan Stanley
and Citigroup Inc. 
Heaton was part of a group of 12 Merrill Lynch bankers who
defected to the German bank last year after Merrill Lynch was
sold to Bank of America Corp. New York-based Merrill Lynch filed
a lawsuit over their departures that was later resolved with a

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy Sterling Commerce for $1.4 billion in cash, gaining software
that helps businesses conduct transactions. 
IBM will buy Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling from ATT Inc.,
the biggest U.S. phone carrier, according to a statement from
the companies today. Its software helps businesses share
information and transfer files to other companies. 
IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano plans to spend
$20 billion on takeovers in the next five years as he bolsters
the software business, IBM&#8217;s most profitable. Sterling&#8217;s
programs allow companies to manage and create their networks on
external servers, a business known as cloud computing -- which
IBM expects to reach $3 billion by 2015. 
&#8220;Plugging this gap was crucial for IBM,&#8221; said Ken
Vollmer, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Syracuse, New
York. &#8220;IBM will be able to take the technology and meld it
together with theirs.&#8221; 
The transaction will likely close in the second half of
2010, the companies said. ATT probably will record a pretax
gain of $750 million on the deal once it&#8217;s completed. About
2,500 Sterling employees will join IBM&#8217;s software division.

General Electric Co., the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, won its first order for a
U.S. offshore project, to be built in Lake Erie near Cleveland. 
GE will supply five direct-drive turbines that can generate
as much as 4 megawatts each in a project with the Lake Erie
Energy Development Corp. that they expect to complete in 2012,
the company said today in a statement. GE will also provide
maintenance services. 
&#8220;Offshore wind has the potential to create thousands of
new jobs in Ohio and become a major source of economic growth,&#8221;
Victor Abate, who runs GE&#8217;s renewable energy businesses, said in
the statement. 
GE will work with Lake Erie Energy to identify additional
locations for offshore wind projects, with the goal of
developing 1,000 megawatts by 2020, he said. 
Ohio Governor Ted Strickland said the project will help
reduce the state&#8217;s reliance on generating electricity from coal.
The state gets about 90 percent of its power from burning the
fossil fuel, which contributes the largest single man-made
source of greenhouse gases. 
Governor Praises Move 
&#8220;There are associated costs with coal that don&#8217;t make it
into the cost of electricity,&#8221; Strickland said today in a media
briefing at a wind energy conference in Dallas. &#8220;We want to use
this project to find ways to produce wind power cheaper.&#8221; 
GE bolstered its access to offshore-turbine technology last
year with its purchase of the ScanWind unit of Morphic
Technologies AB in Sweden for 130 million kronor ($18 million).
ScanWind&#8217;s gearless conversion box is designed to cut
maintenance costs, helping GE compete with offshore leader
Siemens AG. 
The U.K., the nation with the most offshore wind capacity,
has about 8 gigawatts (8,000 megawatts) operating or planned and
is targeting an additional 25 gigawatts, its government said in
June. Growth will also be driven as designs improve for large
offshore turbines, which are costlier and more difficult to
repair than land-based versions, Abate said. 
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE slipped 23 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $16.19 a share as of 1:22 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 7.1 percent
this year.

Walt Disney Co. ended negotiations to
sell its Miramax film studio to Los Angeles billionaire Ron Burkle, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, resumed talks
with Los Angeles investors Alec and Tom Gores, who had earlier
made an offer, said a third person. The people asked not to be
identified because the talks aren&#8217;t public. 
Burkle remains interested, one of the people said. He is
working with Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax founders who
sold the studio to Disney in 1993. The group is talking with the
board of the Weinstein Co. to resolve legal issues that caused
delays, the person said. If a settlement is reached, a deal
could be revived, two people said. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Disney ended
talks. Burkle had offered $625 million, two of the people said.
The Weinstein brothers, who weren&#8217;t expected to hold an equity
stake, were to receive pay and performance bonuses for
overseeing the studio and library. 
Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Weinstein Co., had no immediate comment.
Burkle didn&#8217;t respond to a request for an interview. 
Weinstein Co. investor Mark Cuban said on April 21 that he
may try to stop the Weinstein brothers from joining Burkle&#8217;s
bid. The Cuban dispute involves the 2009 release &#8220;The Road,&#8221;
Dani Weinstein said at the time. The film, produced for $25
million, took in $23.9 million in worldwide ticket sales,
according to researcher Box Office Mojo. 
Disney fell 55 cents to $31.93 at 2:16 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had climbed less
than 1 percent this year before today.

other investors, the people said. 
Alliance  Leicester, a U.K. unit of Banco Santander SA,
Spain&#8217;s largest bank, will issue the notes in dollars, pounds

International Business Machines Corp.
and trade groups for major U.S. companies are pressing Congress
to defeat a jobs bill containing billions of dollars in taxes on
their global operations. 
The effort is led in part by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and an alliance of companies including IBM, Microsoft Corp. and
General Electric Co. They are targeting a measure that extends
aid to unemployed workers, promotes bonds for infrastructure
projects and renews more than three-dozen business tax breaks,
including a credit for experimental research that many of the
companies support. 
In a letter to lawmakers yesterday, Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, told
lawmakers it &#8220;strongly opposes&#8221; the legislation and would
rather do without the research credit than face new taxes on
overseas profits. 
&#8220;Although our company has been a long-time supporter of
the RD tax credit that has enjoyed bipartisan support in
Congress over many years, the pending legislation would impose
significant new tax increases that will completely overwhelm any
positive economic effect&#8221; of the tax credit, wrote Christopher Padilla, vice president of governmental programs for IBM. 
No &#8216;Meaningful Benefit&#8217; 
IBM reduced its effective tax rate by 9 percentage points
in 2009 because it was able to defer U.S. taxes on money earned
in lower-tax countries, according to filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The value of its research tax credits
wasn&#8217;t specified. IBM, in a June 2008 policy document, said it
has been &#8220;unable to derive meaningful benefit&#8221; from the
research credit for &#8220;many years.&#8221; 
Opposition from major U.S.-based multinational corporations
injects a new lobbying front into an effort to defeat the bill,
which has been opposed most prominently by private-equity firms
such as New York-based Blackstone Group LP and Washington-based
Carlyle Group, the National Venture Capital Association and the
Real Estate Roundtable. 
Those groups are trying to block a proposed tax increase on
carried interest, the share of profits that fund executives earn
as part of their compensation. Carried interest is taxed at the
lower capital-gains rate when it involves long-term gains. That
rate is currently 15 percent and is scheduled to rise to 20
percent in 2011. 
Ordinary Rates 
The bill would begin taxing half of carried interest at
ordinary rates as high as 35 percent this year. By 2013, three-
quarters of carried interest would be subject to ordinary rates,
which are scheduled to be more than 40 percent. 
IBM and the business groups are protesting eight provisions
in the bill projected to raise about $14.5 billion by making it
harder for U.S.-based companies to claim credits for taxes they
pay to other governments. The tax credits are intended to
prevent double taxation and can only be claimed when those
foreign profits are repatriated to the U.S. 
U.S. lawmakers, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, say companies are
using a variety of techniques to reduce their U.S. tax bills
without ever bringing their profits to the country. 
Some &#8220;have used techniques to maximize the amount of money
they leave overseas at the same time they&#8217;re claiming&#8221; the
foreign tax credit &#8220;to avoid U.S. taxes on other income
sources,&#8221; Levin told reporters on a conference call today. He
called the technique a &#8220;manipulation of the tax code&#8221; that is
&#8220;tilting the playing field in favor of investment overseas.&#8221; 
Government Spending 
The bill also faces some opposition in the Senate because
it would add to the deficit. It would spend $63 billion to
postpone cuts in Medicare fees to doctors, $55 billion to extend
unemployment benefits and $24 billion to aid state governments.
Lawyers, oil companies and businesses that use offshore tax
havens would see their taxes go up. 
The House is scheduled to debate the broader tax measure
this week, and the Senate is poised to act too. Lawmakers are
under pressure to adopt the bill because the unemployment aid
expires May 31. 
Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, on
the conference call with Levin, wouldn&#8217;t say how soon the bill
will come to the floor. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident that we will have the
votes&#8221; to pass it, he said. 
Opposition to international tax provisions are complicating
the effort to pass more than three-dozen tax breaks that have
been popular with lawmakers in the past, even as they were
criticized for bestowing narrow benefits on special interests
including race track owners, makers of toy bows and arrows,
restaurant operators, and tuna canners. 
Build America Bonds 
The package would also extend the Build America Bonds
program and renew a provision that benefits companies such as
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. that sell financial products in overseas markets. 
The tax breaks, which generally expired Dec. 31 and must be
renewed to be available this year, also include benefits for
individuals, such as a $250 deduction for teachers who buy their
own classroom supplies and a write-off for state and local sales
taxes that primarily benefits residents of states like Texas,
Alaska and Florida, which have no income taxes to deduct on
federal forms. 
&#8220;While the economy needs an extension of expiring
provisions, the chamber cannot support legislation which imposes
onerous, permanent tax increases to pay for the temporary
extension of these provisions,&#8221; wrote Bruce Josten, executive
vice president of government affairs for the Chamber of
Commerce. 
&#8216;Principles of Fairness&#8217; 
A separate coalition, Promote America&#8217;s Competitive Edge,
which counts GE; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft; Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., and Cincinnati-based Procter 
Gamble Co. among its members, also protested the bill, saying
the international tax changes &#8220;run contrary to the principles
of fairness and due process.&#8221; 
The National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington
trade group, today urged lawmakers to strip the international
tax provisions from the bill. It said the way companies use the
foreign tax credit has been &#8220;mischaracterized as loopholes.&#8221; 
&#8220;NAM strongly urges policymakers to advance legislation
that includes much-needed tax relief without anti-growth, anti-
competitiveness revenue raisers,&#8221; the group wrote to House
members.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Achintya Mangla and Aloke Gupte back from Merrill Lynch  Co., about a
month after they departed for the U.S. rival, said two people
with knowledge of the matter. 
Mangla will become co-head of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia outside Japan and Australia
together with Arjun Khullar, one of the people said, declining
to be identified as no public announcement has been made. Gupte
will run convertible bond underwriting for the Asia-Pacific
region, the position Mangla previously held, the person said. 
Investment banks have stepped up hiring in Asia in the past
year as the region led the global economy out of a recession.
Investment-banking fees in Asia jumped 68 percent in the first
four months from a year earlier to a record $5.6 billion,
according to New York-based research firm Freeman  Co. 
Mangla and Khullar will report to Doug Howland and Kester Ng, who were promoted to joint heads of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia-Pacific, the person said. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Marie Cheung
declined to comment, as did Rob Stewart of Merrill Lynch, the
investment-banking division of Bank of America Corp. Mangla and
Gupte weren&#8217;t available, said a person who answered the phone at
JPMorgan&#8217;s Hong Kong offices. 
Merrill Lynch hired Mangla in late April to run its
convertible bond underwriting business in the Asia-Pacific
outside Japan, people with knowledge of the matter said at the
time. Gupte joined Merrill Lynch at the same time. Both bankers
were on so-called gardening leave and hadn&#8217;t yet started work at
Merrill Lynch when JPMorgan rehired them, one person said. They
will be based in Hong Kong.

Johnson Controls Inc. said it may be

bankrupt Visteon Corp.&#8217;s interiors and electronics businesses as
it completes its due diligence. 
&#8220;To the extent that we are able to find additional value
through the due diligence process, we may be able to increase
our price for the two businesses,&#8221; JCI Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Roell said in a May 20 letter to Visteon CEO Don Stebbins that was released yesterday in a regulatory filing. 
Due diligence could be completed as quickly as 30 days,
Roell said, without giving an amount by which the bid might be
increased. The cash offer for the former Ford Motor Co. unit was
made in a May 20 letter, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said
in a separate statement last week. It didn&#8217;t release the letter
at that time. 
Visteon said May 21 in a statement that Johnson Controls,
the largest publicly traded U.S. auto-parts maker, is a
competitor and stands to benefit from introducing &#8220;delay and
complexity&#8221; into its reorganization. 
Jacqueline Strayer, a JCI spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call seeking comment. 
Johnson Controls fell 51 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $27.68
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 48 percent in the past year. 
Visteon, spun off from Ford in 2000, filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, listing assets of $4.58 billion and debt of
$5.32 billion in Chapter 11 documents.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, sold $1.25 billion of 10-year
senior notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The 6 percent fixed-rate debt priced to yield 280 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage points. 
The sale came as companies sold $6 billion in debt today,
the most in five weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Issuance of corporate bonds has fallen 59 percent this month
from April amid growing concerns that European countries will
struggle to manage their debts, slowing the global economic
recovery, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;Goldman is pretty good at timing the market when these
chances open up,&#8221; said Charles Sanford, who helps manage $129
billion at Babson Capital Management LLC in Springfield,
Massachusetts. &#8220;It was an opportunistic deal on Goldman&#8217;s
part.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs paid more to tap the corporate debt market
than it did two months ago, when it sold $750 million of 10-
year, 5.375 percent notes at a spread of 175 basis points on
March 19 in a reopening of an issue from earlier that month,
Bloomberg data show. It paid a 190 basis-point spread when it
sold $2 billion of the notes on March 1, the data show. 
Those notes traded at 95.862 cents on the dollar at 3:53
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
yields 5.94 percent, or 273.6 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Trace data show. On May 25, the bonds ended
trading at a 276.1 basis-point spread, the data show. 
&#8216;Buying Opportunity&#8217; 
&#8220;We think it&#8217;s a buying opportunity now,&#8221; said Michael Donelan, director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan
Labs Inc., who yesterday bought 10-year Goldman Sachs notes. 
Spreads on all investment-grade corporate bonds fell 2
basis points to 204 basis points, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Corporate Master Index. Bonds issued by
banks fell 7 basis points to 276 basis points. 
Investors have demanded higher yields from the world&#8217;s
biggest financial institutions than other corporate bond issuers
because of concern that Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis will
reduce lenders&#8217; creditworthiness and that regulatory efforts to
control risk taking will crimp their profits. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $1.5 billion of 10-year notes sold
on March 25 rose 0.409 cent on the dollar to 100.263 cents at
3:30 p.m. in New York, according to Trace data. The notes yield
4.915 percent, or 171.6 basis points more than benchmarks, Trace
data show. 
Companies selling bonds today included TransCanada
Pipelines Ltd., which offered $1.25 billion of 5- and 30-year
notes, and Discovery Communications Inc., which issued $3
billion of debt in a three-part offering, according to Bloomberg
data. Today&#8217;s total is the most since $12.3 billion on April 21,
Bloomberg data show.

The U.S. economy will expand up to 4
percent annually for a &#8220;couple of years&#8221; and then settle into
a predicted &#8220;new normal&#8221; of slow growth, according to Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
New York-based Kasman said that while he agrees with
Pacific Investment Management Co.&#8217;s new-normal concept, the
economy may be initially buoyant. Pimco Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed A. El-Erian has forecast the worst slump since the Great
Depression will be followed by an environment of below-average
economic expansion, increased regulation and lower consumption
amid higher unemployment. 
&#8220;We are buyers of the idea that there is a new normal in
terms of where unemployment rates are going to be, what the
supply side of the U.S. economy&#8217;s going to deliver,&#8221; Kasman
said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;Our
distinction is we can see a lot of reasons to be pessimistic
about structural performance here in medium-term trends and
still see a couple of years of pretty good growth, 3 to 4
percent.&#8221; 
Newport Beach, California-based El-Erian wrote in a
Bloomberg News column in February that the U.S. economy faces a
&#8220;protracted post-crisis resetting&#8221; as high unemployment
persists. 
Kasman, a former researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, correctly predicted January&#8217;s unexpectedly strong 5.7
percent gain in GDP. JPMorgan forecasts GDP growth for the
second and third quarters to be 4 percent, slowing to 3.5
percent in the fourth quarter and to 3.2 percent for 2011. 
&#8220;The new-normal thesis makes sense in terms of what&#8217;s
happening underneath the surface, but I don&#8217;t think you want to
apply it to GDP and production and labor income data in a world
in which there&#8217;s going to be a cyclical lift that carries us for
a while,&#8221; Kasman said.

One in six U.S. mobile-phone
customers has faced unexpected monthly fees, according to a
survey released by the Federal Communications Commission as part
of a drive to wrest clearer information from wireless carriers. 
Almost half of consumers subscribing to plans with fees for
dropping service before the end of a contract didn&#8217;t know the
amount they would be charged, the agency said today in an e-
mailed statement, citing the survey. 
&#8220;There is still more that can be done to help customers
navigate what is sometimes a confusing marketplace,&#8221; FCC
Chairman Julius Genachowski said in the statement. Consumers
would be helped by &#8220;simple and easy to understand&#8221; purchase
and billing procedures, he said. 
Verizon Wireless, ATT Inc. and other service providers may
face rules similar to those in Europe, where carriers must send
text messages to subscribers who are close to plan limits, the
FCC said May 11. The agency said it is talking with wireless
industry groups about steps to improve bills. 
&#8220;We really can&#8217;t say at this point whether this all will
result in a rulemaking or voluntary standards,&#8221; Joel Gurin,
chief of the FCC Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, said
on a conference call with reporters. 
Of the 30 million Americans who said they were surprised by
their bills, 88 percent weren&#8217;t contacted by their carriers when
charges increased, the agency said today. About 84 percent
weren&#8217;t contacted when they were about to exceed their allowed
minutes, text messages, or data downloads, the agency said. 
FCC &#8216;Micromanage&#8217; 
&#8220;It seems the commission is going to attempt to
micromanage what is an incredible array of choices for
consumers,&#8221; said Steve Largent, president of the Washington-
based CTIA - The Wireless Association, in an e-mailed statement. 
The wireless industry &#8220;does provide &#8216;simple and easy to
understand&#8217; plans for every type of American consumer,&#8221; Largent
said. 
&#8220;Only 36 percent&#8221; of mobile-phone customers who are
familiar with their bills said that they include &#8220;very clear&#8221;
information on early termination fees, the agency said. 
More than a third of people surprised by a bill said
charges jumped by at least $50, and 23 percent said the increase
was $100 or more, the FCC said. 
The telephone survey of 3,005 adults was conducted from
April 19 to May 2 by Abt/SRBI and Princeton Survey Research
Associates International, the FCC said. For responses based on
those with personal cell phones, or about 80 percent of
respondents, the margin of error was plus or minus two
percentage points, the agency said. 
ATT, Verizon 
ATT on May 21 said that beginning June 1, it will increase
early termination fees to $325 from $175 for users of the Apple
Inc. iPhone and other devices used for computing on the go. 
Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. and
U.K.-based Vodafone Group PLC, told the FCC Dec. 18 that
consumers are protected by &#8220;detailed disclosure practices&#8221;
about early termination fees, which doubled in November to $350
for advanced phones. 
Increases in charges for ending a service contract is &#8220;just
not an area we&#8217;re getting into, at least at this point,&#8221; Gurin
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re focused on clarity, disclosure, consumer
information.&#8221;

PTC India Financial Services Ltd., a
company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group
Ltd., is planning a share sale to tap growing investor interest
in the South Asian nation&#8217;s power projects, the chairman said. 
PFS, which invests in electricity generation plants and
assets, needs to raise as much as 10 billion rupees ($211
million) and may make an initial public offering by end
September, said Tantra Narayan Thakur, who is also chairman of
parent company PTC India Ltd. 
&#8220;Today is the best time to invest in the Indian power
market,&#8221; Thakur said in an interview in New Delhi. &#8220;More and
more people want electricity.&#8221; 
India plans to double its installed electricity capacity in
the next seven years to meet energy demand and reduce blackouts
in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. The federal
government has raised at least 102 billion rupees from selling
shares in three state-owned power-related companies since
January. 
PFS may sell a stake to a private equity investor before
the IPO, said Thakur. JM Financial Ltd., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and ICICI Securities Ltd. will advise the sale, he said. 
PTC, India&#8217;s largest power trader, has a 77 percent stake
in PFS and plans to retain a 51 percent holding after the sale,
Thakur said. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie currently hold 11.5
percent each, he said. 
Ashmore Fund 
The banks paid 16 rupees a share for their holdings in 2008,
he said. Macquarie spokesman Paul Scanlon said in an e-mail the
company had no comment. Deepa Jayaraman, a New Delhi-based
spokeswoman at IPAN Hill  Knowlton, which handles public
relations for Goldman Sachs, was unable to respond immediately
to an e-mail requesting comment. 
PTC India is setting up a $1 billion fund with the U.K.-
based Ashmore Group Plc to finance electricity generation
projects in India, he said. 
PTC and Ashmore aim to raise $500 million in the first
round by the end of September that will be invested in eight to
10 thermal and hydropower projects in the pipeline, he said. 
The fund plans to make minimum investments of $25 million
each, mostly in power projects and potentially in energy assets
such as gas import terminals and pipelines, Thakur said. 
PTC may spend up to 3 billion rupees to acquire coal assets
abroad as part of an effort to diversify into fuel sources,
Thakur said. The power trader raised $400 million by selling
shares to institutional investors in January 2008 and May 2009. 
The government sold stakes in Rural Electrification Corp.,
a state-owned lender for power projects, NTPC Ltd., the
country&#8217;s biggest power generator, and SJVN Ltd., operator of
India&#8217;s largest hydropower plant.

Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for the dollar&#8217;s value against the euro to $1.16 from $1.24 by
the end of the year after the Greek debt crisis &#8220;undermined&#8221;
the European Central Bank. 
The 16-nation currency touched a four-year low of $1.2144
on May 19 as Germany&#8217;s ban on some speculative trades against
bank and government credit quality added to concern Greece&#8217;s
funding crisis would spread through the region. The ECB had said
on May 10 it would start buying public- and private-sector debt
as part of a bid to halt the fiscal crisis and rescue the euro. 
&#8220;The initial fiscal problem in the periphery (Greece) has
now become a fiscal problem for core Europe,&#8221; Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
Stephen Hull in London wrote in a report today. &#8220;More
importantly for the euro, it has also undermined the credibility
of the ECB.&#8221; 
The shared currency will reach a low around $1.12 in the
first quarter of 2011 before recovering later in the year, the
research note said. It will probably rise against the pound,
buying 90 pence by the end of the year from 84.77 pence today,
Morgan Stanley predicted. The U.K. currency will probably fall
to $1.29 in December from $1.4582 today. 
&#8220;We see the dollar being well supported for the remainder
of 2010,&#8221; Hull wrote in the report. &#8220;U.S. growth is still
surprising on the upside.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for the dollar versus the
yen, citing data showing a larger flow of funds into Japanese
equities from investors outside the island nation. The New York-
based financial institution predicts gains in the U.S. currency
to 98 yen by the end of the year, less than its previous
estimate of 109 yen. One dollar bought 91.04 yen as of the U.S.
close today. 
The greenback will probably reach the 109 level versus the
yen by the end of 2011, Hull predicted.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit lost a bid
at Canada&#8217;s highest court to block a lawsuit that alleges the
menopause drug Premarin caused breast cancer. 
The Supreme Court of Canada today declined to hear Wyeth&#8217;s
appeal of a British Columbia decision denying the company&#8217;s
claim that its U.S. units couldn&#8217;t be sued in the province. The
high court gave no reason for its decision. 
The ruling clears the way for the suit to proceed to a
certification hearing in December, where plaintiff Dianna
Stanway will ask a judge to let all Canadian women who took
Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement medicines sue as a group, said David
Klein, Stanway&#8217;s lawyer at Klein Lyons in Vancouver. 
&#8220;About nine out of 10 pharmaceutical lawsuits in Canada
are certified,&#8221; Klein said in a phone interview. 
Wyeth&#8217;s U.S. and Canadian units were sued in 2006 by
Stanway, of Sechelt, British Columbia. Stanway claimed she
developed breast cancer as a result of taking estrogen-based
Premarin in combination with the drug progestin. Wyeth&#8217;s U.S.
units urged the appeals court to throw out the suit, claiming
British Columbia courts lacked jurisdiction to try the case. 
Wyeth sold and promoted the drug in Canada and its
&#8220;conduct amounts to personal subjection to the jurisdiction,&#8221;
Judge Kenneth Smith wrote on behalf of the appeals panel. &#8220;It
was therefore reasonable for them to contemplate they might be
sued in British Columbia.&#8221; 
&#8216;Acted Responsibly&#8217; 
The Supreme Court ruling was procedural and not a decision
on the merits of the case, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. 
&#8220;We continue to believe Wyeth acted responsibly by
conducting or supporting more than 180 studies on hormone
therapy&#8217;s benefits and risks,&#8221; Loder said. The company
&#8220;provided proper, accurate and science-based information to
patients and doctors.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker,
completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year. 
The Canadian suit won&#8217;t include women who took menopause
drugs that weren&#8217;t made by Wyeth, which had the biggest market
share in the country, or who suffered from other side effects,
Klein said. 
&#8220;This case is about breast cancer,&#8221; he said. 
The case is Wyeth Pharmaceuticals v. Dianna Louise Stanway,
33580, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). The appeals court case
is Between Dianna Louise Stanway and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
CA036317, Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Vancouver).

Microsoft Corp. fell too far in a
selloff that pushed the software maker&#8217;s market value below
Apple Inc., according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, slumped 18 percent
in May through yesterday, when Apple of Cupertino, California,
was worth $2.94 billion more. Microsoft lost 4.1 percent
yesterday after Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said that
the effects of the European debt crisis will spread. 
&#8220;While European contagion is a concern, Ballmer&#8217;s comments
were not Microsoft specific,&#8221; Sarah Friar, an analyst at New
York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report to clients dated
yesterday. &#8220;The shares underperformed large-cap tech despite
having relatively lower exposure outside of the U.S. Given
significant underperformance and attractive valuation levels, we
are buyers of the shares.&#8221; 
Technology companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index had
retreated 11 percent this month through yesterday. Today,
Microsoft jumped 4 percent, the most since Oct. 23, to $26. 
Goldman&#8217;s Friar said that Microsoft&#8217;s fourth-quarter
earnings, scheduled for July 22, will show signs of improving
corporate demand for personal computers. On average, analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimate sales of $15.2 billion at the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, compared with $13.1 billion a
year earlier. 
Missing Estimates 
Microsoft reported third-quarter revenue last month that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions. Sales rose 6.3
percent to $14.5 billion, compared with analysts&#8217; estimates that
were as high as $14.8 billion for the quarter. 
While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have avoided purchases of machines and long-term contracts.
Investors held out for evidence of a spending resurgence after
chipmaker Intel Corp. forecast record profit margins for 2010. 
FBR Capital Markets Corp. today raised its rating for
Microsoft to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; also citing
the outlook for increased demand from corporations. 
Microsoft&#8217;s stock market value exceeded $400 billion in
2000 before falling to $227.9 billion today. Apple&#8217;s worth has
surged to $230.5 billion from less than $5 billion in 2003. 
&#8220;The stock market will take care of itself,&#8221; Ballmer said
in New Delhi today. &#8220;What&#8217;s the expression? On any given day
the stock market is a voting machine, in the long run only is it
a weighing machine. So let&#8217;s see what happens.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. lost a bid to have a
judge throw out a $9.4 million jury award to an Alabama woman
who developed breast cancer after taking the company&#8217;s menopause
drugs. 
A state-court judge in Philadelphia denied requests by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit to set aside the award to Audrey Singleton
or reduce the $6 million in punitive damages jurors awarded over
her use of the drugmaker&#8217;s hormone-replacement medicines.
Singleton&#8217;s lawyers alleged the company hid the drugs&#8217; health
risks. 
The judge&#8217;s ruling &#8220;validates the jury system and confirms
that this community is outraged by Wyeth&#8217;s conduct,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of Singleton&#8217;s lawyers, said in an interview
today. 
More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by another Pfizer unit. Wyeth combined the
two hormones in its Prempro medicine. 
&#8220;While we are disappointed in the trial court&#8217;s ruling, it
clears the way for the company to appeal this decision,&#8221; Pfizer
spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
stand by our belief that there is no basis in fact or law for
the jury&#8217;s verdict.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines, which are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth last year. 
Litigation Record 
Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by jurors since the cases began going to trial in
2006. The company has persuaded judges to throw out some of
those verdicts at the post-trial stage and reduce awards in
others. 
Singleton, a retired school-bus driver from Chatom,
Alabama, began taking Prempro in August 1997. A mammogram at
that time was normal, her lawyers said during the trial. She
stopped taking the drug in January 2004 after her breast cancer
diagnosis. 
The woman&#8217;s lawyers argued in the case that Wyeth
executives hid or downplayed Prempro&#8217;s health risks as part of a
marketing campaign designed boost sales and put profits over
women&#8217;s health. 
Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before the 2002 Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggested
women using the medicines had a higher breast-cancer risk. 
No New Trial 
Jurors in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas concluded in
February Singleton deserved $3.45 million in compensatory
damages and $6 million in punishment damages over Wyeth&#8217;s
failure to properly warn about the drug&#8217;s risks. 
The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers asked Judge Mark Bernstein to throw
out the verdict and grant Wyeth a new trial or to cut
Singleton&#8217;s damage award. Bernstein denied the company&#8217;s request
in a May 20 order that was made public yesterday, according to
court records. 
Canada&#8217;s highest court today declined to hear Wyeth&#8217;s
appeal of a judge&#8217;s decision to allow a class-action case over
Premarin to proceed in that country&#8217;s courts. A group of
Canadian women are pressing claims that the drug helped cause
their breast cancers. 
The Philadelphia case is Singleton v. Wyeth Inc.,
050102885, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,
Pennsylvania.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, may cut the monthly fee it charges for streaming
music on its Zune portable player, senior product manager Terry
Farrell said in an interview. 
Zune Pass, which features unlimited music streaming and 10
song downloads a month, now costs $14.99. Farrell didn&#8217;t say by
how much Microsoft may cut the service&#8217;s price. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a challenging business,&#8221; Farrell said,
referring to competition in online music. 
Microsoft is contending with rivals that offer music at
little or no charge, while striving to erode Apple Inc.&#8217;s lead
in the market for digital music players and downloadable songs.
RealNetworks Inc.&#8217;s Rhapsody service in April slashed the
monthly price of a premium music service to $10 from $14.99. 
Zune had 2 percent of the U.S. digital music player market
in the first quarter, compared with 76 percent for Apple
products, according to NPD Group Inc., a Port Washington, New
York-based researcher. 
Users can access Microsoft&#8217;s download service on personal
computers and the company&#8217;s Zune players and Kin phones. The
company plans to offer the service on smartphones running its
Windows Phone 7 software later this year, Farrell said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may spend
$621 million to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
fraud suit that triggered a 13 percent one-day drop in the
firm&#8217;s stock, analyst Brad Hintz said. 
Negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank may end with Goldman Sachs paying a
fine of about $250 million, plus $371 million to reimburse
investors in the disputed trades, Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today. 
&#8220;While this would be painful to Goldman, we believe it
would allow both Goldman Sachs and the SEC to walk away
declaring &#8216;victory&#8217;,&#8221; said Hintz, who has had an &#8220;outperform&#8221;
rating on the stock since June 2009. &#8220;Certainly Goldman wants
this case settled. Its management has stated that it wants a
&#8217;normal&#8217; relationship with its regulators.&#8221; 
The amount could reduce the New York-based firm&#8217;s earnings
per share by $1.05, or 5.4 percent of 2010 earnings, which are
estimated to be $19.55, according to the average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. 
Goldman Sachs slumped on April 16 when the SEC accused
Goldman Sachs of defrauding investors in a collateralized debt
obligation linked to home loans. The firm concealed the fact
that Paulson  Co., a New York-based hedge fund, picked
components of the CDO and bet it would collapse, the agency
said. The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
55, has denied wrongdoing. 
SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment.

General Motors Corp.&#8217;s bankruptcy
estate won four more months to wind down under court protection,
an extension that a judge said was warranted because the company
must resolve asbestos and environmental liability claims. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in New York today gave
the bankrupt part of the automaker the exclusive right to
control its liquidation until this fall. The company has until
Sept. 27 to file a Chapter 11 plan and until Nov. 29 to solicit
creditor support. 
&#8220;Its obvious to anyone that, despite what&#8217;s been
accomplished so far, this is still a very, very large case with
some major issues,&#8221; Gerber said. 
The company, Motors Liquidation Co., is liquidating assets
of the former General Motors Corp. The still-operating Detroit-
based automaker is General Motors Co. 
Joseph H. Smolinsky, a lawyer for the company, told Gerber
that the uncertain size of asbestos claims and resolution of
environmental liabilities were holding back formulation of a
consensual plan. 
Progress has been made on environmental issues since
President Obama allocated $800 million last week to clean up and
develop 90 General Motors properties, Smolinsky said. 
&#8220;We can finally report some tangible, meaningful
progress,&#8221; the lawyer said, noting that the money would be put
into a trust for properties in 14 states that covers thousands
of acres around the U.S. 
U.S. Government 
&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time the federal government has spoken
with one voice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not only the Auto Task Force but
also the Environmental Protection Agency has worked with
materials we&#8217;ve provided to them.&#8221; 
Dean Trafalet, legal representative for holders of future
asbestos personal-injury claims, filed a court statement in
support of the extension, saying that due to the latency periods
for asbestos-related diseases, some victims may not be in a
position to assert claims yet. 
&#8220;The investigation of the debtors&#8217; current and future
asbestos-related liabilities is in its infancy,&#8221; Trafalet said,
noting that his group needed time to investigate all asbestos-
related liabilities. 
Unsecured creditors said they supported the extension, and
asked in court documents that the company outline its timeline
to exit Chapter 11 given &#8220;tens of thousands of unsecured
creditors&#8221; awaiting a distribution on their claims. 
Under GM&#8217;s transfer of its assets to new General Motors,
the debtor received 10 percent of stock in the new company and
15 percent of the warrants. Unsecured creditors say they expect
the stock and warrants will be distributed to them. 
The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia is
seeing growth in its swaps business that lets international
investors buy into the kingdom&#8217;s stock market and is looking
&#8220;closely&#8221; at exchange-traded funds. 
&#8220;Not only has the volume of trade been growing, but the
client base has been growing as well both in size and
diversification,&#8221; Habib Achkar, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s managing
director and regional manager for the Middle East and north
Africa, said in an interview in Dubai on May 25. 
Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia was set up three years ago when
it started a joint venture with the Capital Group, a Saudi-based
investment bank. In August 2008, Morgan Stanley began executing
swap transactions on behalf of non-resident foreign investors.
The Persian Gulf&#8217;s first exchange-traded fund opened March 25 on
the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
&#8220;We can execute ETF trades for Saudi, Gulf Cooperation
Council and international investors,&#8221; Chairman Fahad Almubarak
said in the joint interview on May 25. &#8220;At this stage we are
not a market maker, but it is certainly something we are looking
at very closely.&#8221; 
The world&#8217;s largest oil supplier is spending $400 billion
over five years, starting from 2008, to strengthen the economy
and help finance infrastructure projects. Saudi banks tightened
lending after Saad Group, the business owned by billionaire Maan al-Sanea, and Ahmad Hamad Al-Gosaibi  Brothers Co. defaulted on
loans last year. April bank claims on the private sector
increased an annual 3.2 percent compared with 2.4 percent in
March, according to central bank data. 
&#8216;Appetite&#8217; for Lending 
&#8220;We are definitely seeing an increase in bank lending,&#8221;
Almubarak said. &#8220;There&#8217;s appetite and competition to lend to
higher-quality corporates, but the banks have taken a much more
rigorous approach to their lending criteria.&#8221; 
Oil prices are down about 16 percent from a 19-month high
of $87.15 reached on May 3. Futures touched a record $147.27 on
July 11, 2008. 
Sabic Capital, a unit of Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,
delayed the sale of a bond because of unfavorable spreads, Saudi
Basic&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Mutlaq Al-Morished said
yesterday. 
&#8220;We are working on a number of bond mandates which we may
see as early as the second half of the year,&#8221; Almubarak said.

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the
world&#8217;s largest brokerage, cut about 200 jobs as the joint
venture moves closer to full integration, according to a person
with knowledge of the reductions. 
The cuts were mostly from product support areas and didn&#8217;t
involve brokers, said the person, who declined to be named
because the reductions aren&#8217;t public. The brokerage also plans
to hire about 150 private bankers and 35 employees for the
unit&#8217;s capital markets operations, the person said. 
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who led the unit
before succeeding John Mack in January, said earlier this year
that the joint venture expects to realize $1.1 billion of cost
savings by the end of 2011. The division reported pretax income
of $278 million for the first quarter, compared with $119
million in same period a year earlier, before the deal was
completed. 
The brokerage, which has $1.6 trillion in client assets,
was formed last year when Morgan Stanley purchased a controlling
stake in the joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. 
The joint venture will probably close about 120 additional
U.S. offices to eliminate overlapping locations, Charles Johnston, the unit&#8217;s president, said last month. Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney had 18,140 advisers as of March 31, and Johnston
said that figure will likely stay around 18,000. 
&#8220;As we near our one-year anniversary, we are well along in
the integration of the two firms,&#8221; Morgan Stanley spokesman Jim Wiggins said. 
The brokerage&#8217;s pretax profit margin was 9 percent in the
first quarter, up from 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Gorman
has said the firm expects to increase that margin to 15 percent
by the end of this year and more than 20 percent by the end of
2011. 
Fox Business Network reported the job cuts earlier today.

Morgan Stanley more than doubled
Chairman John Mack&#8217;s annual base salary to $2 million effective
June 1, according to a regulatory filing by the bank. 
Mack&#8217;s base salary had been $800,000, and he had opted to
forgo a bonus for the last three years. His salary hadn&#8217;t
increased since he rejoined the New York-based firm in 2005 as
chairman and chief executive officer, according to today&#8217;s
filing. 
Mack, 65, stepped down as CEO at the end of last year,
having led the company through its first quarterly loss in 2007
and the financial crisis in 2008. Mack told shareholders at a
meeting earlier this month that he would resign as chairman if
current CEO James Gorman ever told him he was in the way. 
The raise followed the firm&#8217;s strategy &#8220;to move away from
a compensation program focused largely on annual incentive
awards toward one that is balanced between fixed, short-term and
long-term compensation and to be in line with his new role and
responsibilities as executive chairman of the company&#8217;s Board of
Directors,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said in the filing.

International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano will probably cede the
post next year, raising the possibility of the first female or
first black CEO in the 99-year-old company&#8217;s history. 
Three of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives have stepped down
at 60, with the exception being John Akers, who was forced out
by IBM&#8217;s board before he reached that age. Palmisano, who has
led the company for more than eight years, will hit that mark
next July. IBM&#8217;s tradition of CEOs stepping aside at 60 helps
retain top executives, said Val Rahmani, former general manager
of an IBM security software business. 
&#8220;People need to see that there&#8217;s the opportunity to
progress,&#8221; said Rahmani, who left IBM last year and is now CEO
of the Atlanta-based security software firm Damballa Inc. She
said Palmisano will probably retire next year. &#8220;There&#8217;s loads
of speculation going on at the moment.&#8221; 
IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, has
brought in a CEO from outside the company only once, when it
named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed Akers in 1993. The likely
candidates this time are internal, including the senior vice
presidents who oversee sales, hardware, consulting and
technology services. Steve Mills, the well-respected senior vice
president for software, may be unlikely to take over the top
post since he also turns 60 next year.

Morgan Stanley more than doubled
Chairman John Mack&#8217;s annual base salary to $2 million, the first
increase since he rejoined the firm in 2005. 
Mack&#8217;s raise is effective June 1, the New York-based firm
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Mack&#8217;s base salary as
chairman and chief executive officer had been $800,000, and he
has opted to forgo a year-end bonus for the last three years. 
Mack, 65, stepped down as CEO at the end of last year,
having led the company through its first quarterly loss in 2007
and the financial crisis in 2008. Mack told shareholders at a
meeting earlier this month that he would resign as chairman if
current CEO James Gorman ever told him he was in the way. 
Mack&#8217;s raise is &#8220;in line with his new role and
responsibilities as executive chairman of the company&#8217;s Board of
Directors,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said in the filing. It follows the
firm&#8217;s strategy &#8220;to move away from a compensation program
focused largely on annual incentive awards.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley last month reported its largest quarterly
profit since 2007, as it recovers from the crisis that included
a $10 billion bailout from the government in 2008 and the bank&#8217;s
first annual per-share loss in 2009. Last year, it repaid the
taxpayer funds and took a controlling stake in a joint venture
with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage. 
Shareholders voted against a proposal earlier this month
that would have required the chairman be an independent director
who hasn&#8217;t previously served as an executive officer of the
company. 
200 Jobs Cut 
Mack said earlier this year that compensation on Wall
Street was too high and proposed an &#8220;open discussion&#8221; between
major investment banks and regulators to address the issue. Mack
hasn&#8217;t taken a cash bonus since he took the helm of the firm in
2005. He received a $40 million stock bonus in 2006. 
The firm also cut about 200 jobs in Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney brokerage, a person with knowledge of the reductions said
yesterday. The cuts were mostly from product support areas and
didn&#8217;t involve brokers, said the person, who declined to be
named because the reductions aren&#8217;t public. 
The brokerage also plans to hire about 150 private bankers
and 35 employees for the unit&#8217;s capital markets operations, the
person said.

The acquisitions will most likely be abroad because of

Morgan Stanley hired Kazunobu Ezawa,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director, for its
fixed-income business in Japan, according to an internal company
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Ezawa, 42, this month joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities
Co., a joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
to help boost fixed-income sales to listed Japanese companies
and add new clients, the Morgan Stanley memo said. 
New York-based Morgan Stanley in April posted earnings that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue more
than doubled from a year earlier. The bank follows UBS AG and
other overseas banks in luring executives away from rivals in
Japan after the value of domestic bond transactions in the
country rose 12 percent to 16 trillion yen ($174 billion) last
year. 
Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
confirmed the hiring, without commenting further. Ezawa wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for comment. 
Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ started two joint
ventures this month for investment banking and trading. Teaming
up with Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in the Wall
Street firm in 2008, may help Morgan Stanley bolster its ranking
in advising on Japanese mergers and securities underwriting. 
Mitsubishi UFJ ranked second in Japanese domestic bond
underwriting last year and Morgan Stanley ranked eighth,
according to Bloomberg data. 
First-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading
at Morgan Stanley jumped to $2.7 billion last quarter from $1.29
billion a year earlier helping it return to a net income of
$1.78 billion in the period, it said in a statement on April 21. 
Ezawa will be a managing director at the bank, according to
the internal memo. 
UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, earlier this month hired
former Nomura Holdings Inc. executive Zenji Nakamura to run its
fixed income, currencies and commodities unit in Japan. Bank of
America Corp. last month recruited Tomomi Kikuchi from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to head sales of mortgage-backed securities in Japan.
Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of Bank of America,
in April appointed Kikuchi as a managing director.

China&#8217;s stocks may &#8220;meander&#8221; at
current levels for the next few months on concern that policy
tightening and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will derail global growth,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Jing Ulrich. 
&#8220;In the near term, we still remain quite cautious on both
A shares and H shares because you still have a lot of
uncertainty in China,&#8221; Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities and
commodities at JPMorgan, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview, referring to yuan-denominated Chinese stocks and
those traded in Hong Kong. &#8220;Globally, in Europe, people are
beginning to question the global economic recovery, whether
that&#8217;s intact,&#8221; she said. 
The Shanghai Composite Index lost 9.7 percent last month,
the most since August, and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
retreated 5.6 percent as the government raised bank reserve
requirements for a third time this year and Europe stepped up
measures to cut budget deficits. Europe is China&#8217;s biggest
export destination, making up 20 percent of total overseas sales. 
Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in May,
data showed today, adding to signs that growth may moderate in
the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy. 
Real estate closings in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in
May plunged as contract numbers dropped by as much as 70 percent
from April, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
data from a local property website, a property agent and the
government. 
Property Curbs 
&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly seeing momentum slowing. Back in mid
April, the Chinese government introduced a series of measures to
tighten control of the property sector,&#8221; Ulrich said. &#8220;Since
then we&#8217;ve seen transaction volumes fall, we&#8217;ve seen the stock
market correcting and in the meantime, I think the sentiment is
spilling over to the industrial sector as well.&#8221; 
Stocks will only rally when government policy stabilizes
and &#8220;uncertainties&#8221; removed, she said. 
In the last two weeks of April, the government raised
mortgage rates and down payment ratios, barred lending for
third-home purchases and ordered tighter scrutiny of developers&#8217;
financing to restrain property prices that surged 11.7 percent
in March. 
The Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index fell to 53.9 from 55.7 in
April, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
That was less than the median 54.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News
economist survey. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion. A
separate purchasing managers&#8217; index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics fell to 52.7 in May from 55.2 in April.

Walt Disney Co. aims to almost double
annual retail sales of licensed merchandise in five to seven
years after buying comic-book and film maker Marvel
Entertainment in December. 
Products licensed by Disney may reach $50 billion in sales,
compared with $27 billion in fiscal 2009, Andrew Mooney, head of
the Burbank, California-based company&#8217;s consumer-products
division, said today on a webcast presentation. 
The company plans to open a redesigned store in New York&#8217;s
Times Square this fall as the U.S. continues to recover from the
recession, Mooney said. Disney&#8217;s media networks, the biggest
division, contributed 71 percent of operating income last year,
compared with 9 percent from consumer products. 
Products tied to &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; in theaters June 18, will
sell $2.4 billion in related merchandise, Mooney said. &#8220;Cars&#8221;
has averaged $2 billion annually in retail sales of branded
products since its 2006 release. A &#8220;Cars&#8221; sequel, due in
theaters next year, may set a record for merchandise sales, he
said. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, climbed $1.41,
or 4.2 percent, to $34.74 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year.

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest
media company, went on trial over claims it cheated the U.K.
creator of the &#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; game show
through self-dealing. 
Celador International Ltd. sued Disney six years ago,
alleging Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied
promise by failing to negotiate a higher license fee with
Disney&#8217;s ABC television network after the show proved a hit.
Celador says that prevented Buena Vista from making a bigger
profit it would have had to share with the creators. 
&#8220;They agreed that BVT would only be paid enough money to
cover the cost of making the show and BVT would never make a
profit,&#8221; Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for Celador, said today
during his opening statement in federal court in Riverside,
California. &#8220;When they got through making their secret deal,
the ad revenue was shielded, no one could ever get to it.&#8221; 
The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift ABC to first place from third in audience ratings in
2000, prompting the network to run the program four times a
week. &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998
and has been carried in 106 countries, including Australia,
India, Japan, Germany and Russia, Celador said. 
Share of Profit 
Closely held Celador entered into an agreement with Buena
Vista, a production and distribution unit of Disney, and ABC in
1998 that entitled the creators to a share of the profit from
the show in North America, according to a 2006 amended
complaint. Silberfeld said Buena Vista made an &#8220;implied promise&#8221;
in the agreement to &#8220;act in good faith&#8221; to obtain the highest
possible price for the show. 
Instead, Celador said in its lawsuit, ABC paid below-market
value for &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; because Buena Vista, at Disney&#8217;s
behest, didn&#8217;t seek a higher fee after the show became a
success. The creators also claim Disney, using an affiliated
production company, inflated production costs. 
The creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the
network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; as well as $16 million for
merchandising, Silberfeld said today. 
Disney&#8217;s lawyer Martin Katz responded in his opening
statement that Buena Vista has shopped the show to other
networks who weren&#8217;t interested. 
&#8220;Buena Vista took the financial risk and there was no
secret deal between Buena Vista and ABC,&#8221; Katz said. &#8220;The
division of rights between ABC and BTV is just how one would
expect division of rights to be,&#8221; Katz said. 
Celador so far has received $19.2 million in production
fees for the shows, $13 million for the network broadcasts, $6.2
million for syndicated shows, Katz said. 
The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.,
04-3541, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Riverside.)

Walt Disney Co. isn&#8217;t considering
delaying sales of its DVDs to video-rental kiosk operator Redbox
as other studios have, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said. 
Iger, speaking at a conference sponsored by Sanford C.
Bernstein today, said Disney hasn&#8217;t seen any cannibalization of
new DVD sales from Coinstar Inc.&#8217;s Redbox, which rents movies
for $1 a day. 
Disney has a higher ratio between box-office and home
entertainment sales than rivals who are delaying titles to
Redbox, Iger said. Redbox agreed to begin carrying discs 28 days
after DVDs from Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros. and Universal
Studios go on sale. In return, Redbox receives discounts that
are unacceptable to Disney, Iger said. 
&#8220;We would not have made as much money,&#8221; Iger said.
&#8220;Selling them units at a 50 percent reduction in cost, or
whatever the proposition, even for the 28-day window was not an
equation that made sense to us.&#8221; 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained $1.09 to
$34.42 at 12:20 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares climbed 3.4 percent this year before today. 
Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York,
criticized Iger today in a report for allowing &#8220;Alice in
Wonderland&#8221; to be available in Redbox kiosks. 
&#8220;A key thesis behind our buy rating on Disney is the
dramatic improvement we expect in studio&#160;entertainment&#160;over the
coming year,&#8221; Greenfield wrote. &#8220;Disney should want us to buy,
not rent for $1/day.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Ian Henderson,
manager of $7 billion in natural-resource assets, sold about a
quarter of his combined Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd.
holdings on concern a proposed Australian tax will curb growth. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say we&#8217;ve reduced our Australian exposure,&#8221;
Henderson said in a phone interview today. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a wake-up
call frankly. I had not thought that the changes in Australia
would be quite as drastic as they are proposed to be.&#8221; 
Australia last month said it planned to impose a 40 percent
tax on mining company profits from 2012 to raise A$12 billion
($10 billion) in the first two years of the changes. Rio, BHP
and Xstrata Plc are reviewing the viability of some projects in
the country and are pressing for changes to the plan. 
&#8220;It clearly does reduce the attractions of developing new
projects in Australia and indeed investing in Australian-based
mining ventures,&#8221; Henderson, who has been a fund manager with
JPMorgan since 1991, said from London. &#8220;It has made people
aware of the potential for these industries to be used as milk
cows by governments. That has altered the risk profile for the
mining industry probably for quite a long time.&#8221; 
Rio, the third-largest mining company, had been Henderson&#8217;s
top holding, comprising about 4.5 percent of his funds,
including the Global Natural Resources Fund. The stake in the
company &#8220;has been reduced by about $100 million,&#8221; he said. The
fund returned 111 percent in 2009, according to Bloomberg data. 
While Henderson cut stakes in companies with Australian
assets shortly after the tax plan was announced, he has raised
holdings of gold miners. Prices of the metal are up 11 percent
this year and reached a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14. 
Buying Gold 
&#8220;Our gold exposure has gone up over the past couple of
months,&#8221; Henderson said. 
Among the companies likely to be affected by the taxation
plan, Henderson also made a &#8220;reasonably significant&#8221; reduction
in his holdings of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. 
Fortescue, Australia&#8217;s third-largest iron ore exporter, put
about $15 billion of projects on hold because of the plan, the
Perth-based company said May 19. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the
world&#8217;s third-largest gold producer, will also cut exploration
spending in the country if the tax is approved, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Cutifani said today by phone from Canberra. 
Rio, based in London, fell 1.4 percent to 3,107.5 pence by
12:31 p.m. in the city and has dropped 7.9 percent since the
plan was announced on May 2. Melbourne-based BHP declined 1.7
percent and is down 8.9 percent from May 2. 
Rio yesterday said it was paying its &#8220;fair share&#8221; of
taxes after contributing more than $20 billion in the past
decade. Xstrata Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said the
proposed levy may prompt companies to cancel investments. 
Immovable Feast 
&#8220;Resources are immovable but diversified mining companies
have a choice of countries in which to invest,&#8221; Davis wrote in
a letter today in the Financial Times. &#8220;Investments in
Australian resources are at risk of being delayed or
cancelled.&#8221; Xstrata is based in Zug, Switzerland. 
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday vowed to push ahead
with his proposals, which will apply to profits on resource
projects above the long-term bond rate, currently about 6
percent. Australia is the biggest exporter of coal and iron ore.

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney fired
George Friedlander, a municipal bond strategist for more than
three decades, as it integrates two formerly separate firms,
according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Friedlander, 62, worked at Citigroup Inc. and its
predecessors for 34 years, publishing weekly analysis of the
U.S. municipal market. He joined the Morgan Stanley unit in
2009. The world&#8217;s largest brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in
client assets, was formed last year as a joint venture when
Morgan Stanley bought control of the Smith Barney broker unit of
Citigroup. 
Friedlander was among 200 employees let go, mostly from
product support areas, according to a person with knowledge of
the reductions. Friedlander declined to comment, citing a
confidentiality agreement. Jim Wiggins, a Morgan Stanley
spokesman, declined to comment. 
Friedlander, who provided market and portfolio ideas to
rich investors and institutional clients, was named to
Institutional Investor&#8217;s &#8220;All-American Research Team&#8221; for 14
years, according to his biography. He was a member of the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association&#8217;s
municipal division executive committee for 29 years. In 1997,
Friedlander received the association&#8217;s Chairman&#8217;s Contribution
Award, for service to the industry. 
Friedlander graduated from the State University of New York
at Stony Brook with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in mathematics. He
received a master&#8217;s degree in business administration from Pace
University in New York. 
The Bond Buyer newspaper reported Friedlander&#8217;s firing
earlier today.

Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s new motion-
detecting video gaming device, being shown at an electronics
conference this month, may help revive slowing sales of its Xbox
console. 
Code-named Natal, the device will be an add-on to the Xbox
360, which has shipped 40&#160;million units in five years and trails
only Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii. Natal sits in front of the TV and has
built-in sensors, letting users play games without a controller.
Natal picks up the motion while gamers drive a pretend car or
swing a virtual baseball bat, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in
its June 7 issue. 
Reinvigorating Xbox&#160;360 sales may help Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft delay having to field a new machine, which would
lose hundreds of millions of dollars for a few years. Xbox sales
have slowed since Sony Corp. cut the price of the PlayStation 3
console last summer. Natal&#8217;s technology is another step in
Microsoft&#8217;s decade-long push to move beyond PCs and into game
consoles, music players and smartphones. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a bunch of third party games to take
advantage of the Natal technology,&#8221; says Katherine Egbert, an
analyst with Jeffries  Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;This will create
a product cycle for the gaming division without a new console.&#8221;

technology conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. He
didn&#8217;t give a timeframe. At the same time, Apple has &#8220;done a
good job&#8221; and Google&#8217;s Android has become a &#8220;real
competitor,&#8221; the executive said. 
Microsoft last week announced the resignation of Robbie Bach as head of the division that sells software for mobile
devices, following the company&#8217;s share losses to Apple and other
new entrants. Microsoft aims to revive growth with its own
mobile phone -- a first for the Redmond, Washington-based
company -- and a new Windows mobile program later this year. 
Another competitor, Research In Motion Ltd., has done well
expanding the audience for its BlackBerry among consumers,
Ballmer said at the conference. 
Earlier during his on-stage interview, the executive said
technology spending by businesses is rebounding. 
&#8220;At least for now, we continue to see developed countries&#8217;
business coming back,&#8221; he said. 
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in April
that the company is seeing signs of improvement in demand and
businesses had started spending on personal computers again. 
Still, Ballmer said last week on a trip to Singapore that
any economic problems in Europe will have a &#8220;ripple impact&#8221;
elsewhere. 
Microsoft rose 40 cents to $26.86 as of 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have fallen 12
percent this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s London unit
was fined a record 33.3 million pounds ($48.6 million) by
Britain&#8217;s financial regulator for not properly separating client
money from the firm&#8217;s accounts. 
An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement today. As much as $23 billion of client money held by
the bank&#8217;s futures and options business wasn&#8217;t put in separate
overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the FSA said. 
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman&#8217;s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. 
&#8220;The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected,&#8221; said
Margaret Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement director. &#8220;This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline.&#8221; 
Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. 
Reduced Fine 
JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA&#8217;s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients&#8217; money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts. 
The breach was &#8220;regretful,&#8221; according to an internal memo
by JPMorgan Securities Chief Executive Officer Daniel Pinto and
obtained by Bloomberg News. 
&#8220;The settlement involves us paying a fine based on a fixed
formula of 1 percent of the average amount of client money held
by our FO business,&#8221; Pinto said in the memo. &#8220;As the FSA
acknowledges, JPMorgan Securities Ltd. is one of the largest
holders of client money in the U.K., and the size of the fine
reflects that.&#8221; 
&#8216;Patently Inconsistent&#8217; 
The error stemmed from the 2000 merger of JPMorgan  Co.
with the Chase Manhattan Corp., according to the FSA&#8217;s
investigative report. After the merger the combined treasury
function didn&#8217;t recognize client money from the futures and
options business, according to the report. 
The regulator said in January that two firms that it didn&#8217;t
identify faced a penalty after the FSA started investigations
into how they held client money. Those inquiries were started at
the same time as a London judge ruled that the FSA&#8217;s client-
money rules were &#8220;patently inconsistent and flawed&#8221; in a case
over the administration of Lehman&#8217;s European unit. 
The regulator said at the time that it would consult on
changes to parts of its rulebook, specifically over transfer
arrangements and on firms keeping buffers that could top up
client-money accounts. Proposals are scheduled later this year. 
&#8220;The client-money regime was neglected by the FSA prior to
the financial crisis,&#8221; said Darren Fox, a regulatory lawyer at
Simmons  Simmons advising a hedge fund in the Lehman case. &#8220;I
wonder whether today&#8217;s fine is symptomatic of the FSA&#8217;s guilty
conscience in relation to the Lehman client-money failings, for
which the FSA received a fair bit of flak.&#8221; 
Tougher Approach 
Today&#8217;s fine is nearly twice as much the then-record 17
million-pound fine levied against Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2004
for market abuse. 
The agency has said fines will increase as part of its new
tougher approach following the financial crisis. In some cases,
penalty size will triple. 
The U.K.&#8217;s coalition government has said it will merge some
of the FSA&#8217;s enforcement powers with other prosecutors to form a
white-collar crime agency even in the wake of increased
penalties and criminal cases filed by the FSA. 
The FSA may also lose its independence to the Bank of
England and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is
considering scrapping it, the Guardian newspaper reported today,
citing government sources. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see they&#8217;re doing their job; they&#8217;ve got to
crack down on abuses,&#8221; Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat
lawmaker who is the coalition government&#8217;s business secretary,
said of today&#8217;s fine in a Bloomberg TV interview. &#8220;The basic
point, which I know the chancellor is trying to ensure, is that
the Bank of England has proper oversight of systemic risk. How
you do it administratively is not an easy task.&#8221; 
Amid the uncertainty, the FSA enforcement team separately
suffered a defeat today with its first loss of an insider-
trading trial. Two lawyers and a former chief financial officer
were cleared today by a London court in the regulator&#8217;s fourth
criminal case of insider dealing to reach jury trial.

Ian Henderson, who manages about $7
billion in natural-resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
added to his holdings in gold mining companies in the last two
months as the metal advanced to a record. 
Shares of precious-metal and diamond mining companies now
account for 39 percent of holdings, Henderson said in an
interview from London yesterday. His funds reduced holdings in
companies with links to Australia after the government announced
a mining tax, freeing up cash for the gold purchases, he said. 
Gold climbed to a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14 and
is set for a 10th consecutive annual advance, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920. Fund managers including
George Soros and John Paulson bought bullion as investors sought
to protect themselves from plunging stock markets after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 and this
year&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. 
&#8220;Gold mining stocks are as cheap as they&#8217;ve been for a
long time because for the first time in years they are making
proper profits,&#8221; Henderson said. Gold and precious metals
accounted for 34.1 percent of holdings at the end of April, he
said at a conference in London today. 
Barrick Gold Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest gold mining
company, is trading at 18.9 times earnings, down from as much as
26.6 times in December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Toronto-based company in April reported first-quarter profit
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. Newmont Mining Corp., the largest
U.S. gold producer, trades at 16.4 times earnings, down from
26.7 times in December. 
&#8216;Strongest Since 1970s&#8217; 
&#8220;Gold in portfolios is the strongest it&#8217;s been since the
1970s,&#8221; Henderson said today. 
Henderson&#8217;s 1.9 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) Gl obal Natural
Resources fund and 1.95 billion-pound ($2.9 billion) U.K.
Natural Resources own shares in both Barrick and Newmont.
Barrick has climbed 8.1 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange
this year and Newmont is up 18 percent in New York trading. 
Henderson also reduced holdings in uranium mining
companies on expectations that supply will continue to outpace
demand, he said. 
Uranium was at $40.75 a pound this week, according to
Roswell, Georgia-based Ux Consulting Co. The metal, used in
nuclear reactors, reached a record $136 a pound in 2007. 
Investments in energy companies account for about 27
percent of the assets in Henderson&#8217;s funds, with about 29
percent in iron ore and industrial metals and the rest in
fertilizers and agriculture.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for U.S. payrolls in May to 600,000 from a prior
estimate of 500,000, the company&#8217;s chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note today to clients. 
The government probably hired 450,000 temporary workers to
conduct the census, 100,000 more than the firm&#8217;s previous
estimate, Hatzius said. Goldman&#8217;s estimate for private sector
hiring held at 150,000. It also forecasts the unemployment rate
will fall to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent. 
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the Labor
Department will report tomorrow that payrolls climbed by 523,000
in May, boosted by census hiring. Estimates ranged from 220,000
to 750,000. 
Private payrolls probably rose 178,000 after a gain of
231,000 in April, according to the survey median. The
unemployment rate fell to 9.8 percent, the survey showed.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may be interested in buying parts of
American International Group Inc.&#8217;s operations in Asia, two
people familiar with the matter said. 
The Italian insurer would consider an acquisition if AIG
decides to sell units rather than pursue an initial public
offering for AIA Group Ltd., the holding company controlling the
Asian businesses, said the people, who asked not be identified
because the matter is confidential. 
Generali, which weighed a bid for AIG&#8217;s Chinese business at
the end of 2008, is expanding in emerging markets, including
China and the Middle East, to offset the impact of the worst
recession in more than 30 years in Italy last year. 
Generali would have to sell shares to finance a purchase,
Alberto Villa, an analyst at Milan-based brokerage Intermonte
Sim SpA, wrote in a note yesterday. The failure of talks to sell
AIA Group to London-based Prudential Plc &#8220;may open the interest
of Generali for some activities in case of a break up,&#8221; he
said. 
A Generali spokesman said it&#8217;s premature to discuss the
matter given that AIG hasn&#8217;t decided how to proceed. The Italian
insurer&#8217;s interest in AIG assets was reported by newspaper MF
earlier today. 
AIG, which is selling assets to repay its $182.3 billion
U.S. bailout, is revisiting plans for a Hong Kong offering of
AIA Group after the collapse of the Prudential deal. The U.K.
insurer said yesterday it terminated an agreement to buy the AIG
unit for $35.5 billion and cancelled a rights offering linked to
the acquisition.

Johnson Matthey Plc, producer of a
third of all autocatalysts, posted a 5.6 percent decline in
full-year profit and said first-half earnings will be
&#8220;significantly&#8221; higher than a year earlier. 
Net income slipped to 164.2 million pounds ($241.9 million)
in the year through March from 173.9 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Profit trailed the 173.3 million-pound average estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;Whilst considerable short-term uncertainties about the
global economy remain, the group is expected to make good
progress in the first half,&#8221; the company said in the statement.
&#8220;Underlying profit before tax should be significantly higher&#8221;
than a year earlier. 
Johnson Matthey rose as much as 2.3 percent to 1,591 pence
in London trading, and was at 1,575 pence as of 8:04 a.m. local
time. 
The company&#8217;s autocatalyst division will &#8220;perform well&#8221;
in the first half as the withdrawal of government incentives for
consumers to replace older cars takes time to feed through to
the business, Johnson Matthey said. The performance of the
platinum refining unit is &#8220;much stronger&#8221; than a year earlier,
it said. 
Sales were little changed at 7.84 billion pounds.

General Motors Co., the best selling
overseas automaker in China, said sales in the nation rose at
the weakest pace last month since March 2009, as growth slowed
at its SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co. joint venture. 
GM and its partners in China sold 196,004 vehicles in May,
an increase of 25.4 percent from a year earlier, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. Its rate of growth was in
line with the wider passenger-car market, which grew 25 percent
to 885,000 vehicles in May, the China Automotive Technology 
Research Center said on June 1. 
Falling stock prices and rising inflation are eroding
wealth in the world&#8217;s largest automobile market. Meanwhile,
buyers are becoming cautious after the government introduced
measures to clamp down on a property market bubble, said Yale Zhang, a Shanghai-based director at CSM Asia, an automotive
consulting company. 
&#8220;This is not a single carmaker&#8217;s problem, it&#8217;s the
market&#8217;s problem,&#8221; Zhang said in a phone interview today.
After record-high sales last year demand growth is getting
weaker each month, he said 
Liuzhou-based SAIC-GM-Wuling, which accounts for over half
of GM&#8217;s China volume, increased sales by 5.2 percent to 105,395
units in May, GM said. That&#8217;s down from an 18.9 percent increase
in April, 42.6 percent in March and a gain of 37.7 percent in
February, according to GM&#8217;s website. 
$4,000 Mini Vehicles 
The partnership, which sells mini vehicles including
Sunshine vans for as little as $4,000 each, is 34 percent-owned
by the U.S. automaker. SAIC Motor Corp., China&#8217;s largest
domestic car company, owns 50.1 percent and Liuzhou Wuling
Automotive Co. owns 15.9 percent. 
The unit&#8217;s relatively low growth is explained by strong
sales in the month a year earlier, CSM Asia&#8217;s Zhang said. New
models may help GM may do better than other carmakers this year,
he said. 
Sales at Shanghai General Motors Co., a venture with SAIC
Motor, which makes Buicks in China, rose 48.7 percent from a
year earlier to 83,302 units, according to the statement. 
The 25 percent growth rate for Chinese passenger car sales
in May compares with April&#8217;s 34 percent advance, according to
the automotive center. 
GM China President Kevin Wale said last month that while
the country&#8217;s car sales growth will slow this year, the
automaker is keeping a forecast to sell than 2 million cars this
year. 
&#8216;Industry Cycle&#8217; 
Weaker growth is &#8220;a natural part of the industry cycle,&#8221;
Wale said at a conference in Ningbo, a city in the eastern part
of China, on May 16. &#8220;Underlying demand is very strong.&#8221; 
GM and its partners in the nation sold 1.03 million units
in the first five months of the year, an increase of 53.9
percent from a year earlier, the Detroit-based company said
today. 
China, which overtook the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest auto
market last year, is GM&#8217;s largest market. The carmaker aims to
sell 3 million vehicles a year in China by 2015. It plans to
introduce 25 new or updated models in the country by the end of
2011.

Inside an industrial warehouse in
South San Francisco, California, Harrison Dillon, chief
technology officer of startup Solazyme Inc., examines a beaker
filled with a brown paste made of sugar cane waste. While the
smell brings to mind molasses, this goo, called bagasse, won&#8217;t
find its way into people-pleasing confections. 
Instead, scientists will empty it into 5-gallon metal
flasks of algae and water. The algae will gorge on the treat --
filling themselves with fatty oils as they double in size every
six hours, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its July issue. 
Down the hall, past a rainbow of algae strains arrayed in
Petri dishes, Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Wolfson shows off
a gallon-size bottle of slightly viscous liquid. After drying
the algae, wringing out the oil and shipping it to a refinery,
this is the prize: diesel fuel that Wolfson says is chemically
indistinguishable from its petroleum-based equivalent and which
has already powered a Jeep Liberty and a Mercedes Benz sedan. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve produced tens of thousands of gallons, and by the
end of 2010, I hope I can say we&#8217;ve produced hundreds of
thousands,&#8221; Wolfson, 39, says. &#8220;In the next two years, we
should get the cost down to the $60 to $80-a-barrel range.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is facing a
tough operating environment that could affect earnings,
according to two analysts who released notes to investors today. 
Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners analysts led by Jeff Harte said
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told them in
a recent meeting that market participants are in a state of
paralysis because of fear and uncertainty regarding economic
challenges in Europe and regulatory changes. 
Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities cut his estimates for
Goldman&#8217;s earnings and stock price because of the debt crisis in
Europe and because &#8220;the current business environment is weak,&#8221;
according to a note he sent investors. Bove cut his estimate for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2010 earnings to $17.17 a share from an earlier
estimate of $18.72 and slashed his share price target to $182
from $200. 
Goldman Sachs, the bank facing a fraud lawsuit from the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, reported record
earnings in 2009 and its second-best quarter ever in the first
three months of the year. The stock is down $1.09 to $142.95 at
3 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading today and
has dropped 15 percent so far this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged a
$450 million collateralized loan obligation, according to people
familiar with the transaction, making it the third widely
syndicated transaction of the year. 
Last week&#8217;s deal marks a reversal for CLO issuance, which
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, fell to $26.5 billion in
2009, its lowest level in more than a decade as the credit
crisis and subsequent drop in loan prices made it economically
difficult to arrange new funds. Loan prices on the SP/LSTA US
Leveraged Loan 100 Index ended at 89.07 cents on the dollar
yesterday, gaining 50 percent since Dec. 17, 2008, and helping
lure investors back to these types of investments. 
&#8220;There are still a lot of challenges for the new-issue
market to emerge in a robust form, but it&#8217;s certainly the case
that it has begun to thaw a bit,&#8221; said Vishwanath Tirupattur,
an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. &#8220;The signs are
positive.&#8221; 
Citigroup Inc. priced a $525 million CLO overseen by WCAS
Fraser Sullivan Investment Management LLC in March, the first
new issue backed by widely syndicated loans in a year. The bank
also arranged a $325 million loan package last month for Apollo
Management LP, the first deal of the year backed by new-issue
debt. Both deals were increased from initial plans, bringing
total issuance this year to $1.3 billion.

Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Asia Chairman
Stephen Roach will return to New York from Hong Kong, ending a
three-year stay in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing region, to take a
teaching post at Yale University. 
Roach, formerly the firm&#8217;s chief economist, will remain
with Morgan Stanley and assume the role of non-executive
chairman for Asia from July 1, the New York-based company said
in a statement today. 
The 64-year-old economist, who has predicted China will
overtake the U.S. as the dominant economy by 2025, relocated to
Hong Kong in 2007 to lead a push to arrange more takeovers and
stock sales in the region. Roach, who joined Morgan Stanley in
1982, said he wants to rejoin his family after three years
&#8220;living out of a suitcase&#8221; in Asia and plans to use the
teaching post to correct &#8220;misperceptions&#8221; of China. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not walking away from Morgan Stanley,&#8221; Roach said in
a telephone interview today. &#8220;I have a lot of our clients and
will continue to spend as much time with them in the future as I
have in the past.&#8221; 
Roach will travel regularly for Morgan Stanley and &#8220;stay
connected to clients, governments and regulators in Asia and
other parts of the world,&#8221; the firm said in today&#8217;s statement. 
He is also accepting a joint appointment at the Jackson
Institute for Global Affairs and the School of Management,
according to the statement.

Attorney Olivier Metzner says
thousands of Societe Generale SA&#8217;s own computer records will
clear his client, Jerome Kerviel, of responsibility for the
bank&#8217;s record 4.9 billion-euro ($6 billion) trading loss,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Alan Katz and Heather Smith report. 
Riding through Paris in his chauffeur-driven Jaguar XF,
Metzner, 60, chuckles. He suspects that his success in getting
that data -- more than a year after French investigators had
completed their probe without digging into them -- unnerved
prosecutors. 
&#8220;Ah, yes, I irritate the powers that be,&#8221; said Metzner. 
Metzner took over Kerviel&#8217;s defense more than a year after
the 33-year-old former trader was blamed for Societe Generale&#8217;s
loss. Kerviel goes on trial June 8 for abuse of trust, faking
documents and computer hacking. He faces as many as five years
in jail if found guilty. 
The trial pits him against France&#8217;s second-biggest bank by
market value. The bank&#8217;s former chairman, Daniel Bouton,
described Kerviel as a &#8220;fraudster&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; the day
he announced the loss on Jan. 24, 2008. 
The disclosure came months before Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy and the revelation of the Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC Ponzi scheme. It also turned Kerviel
into a local hero, seen by 77 percent of France as a victim of
the system, according to a poll taken two weeks after the loss
was announced. 
Metzner has made a career mining case files and legal
technicalities to spring clients from jail and get companies and
executives out of trouble. 
While he speaks passionately of defending the underdog,
Metzner&#8217;s clients include a lot of big names. About 80 percent
of his practice is corporate. He&#8217;s on retainer for Bouygues SA,
France&#8217;s second-biggest construction company. And he defended
Houston-based Continental Airlines Inc. against manslaughter
charges after a French investigation concluded debris from a
Continental plane brought down the Concorde supersonic jet in
2000. A verdict in the four-month trial, which ended May 28, is
due in December. 
Metzner &#8220;can grasp things quickly, keep them all in mind,
and distill them,&#8221; said Carson Seeligson, head of Continental&#8217;s
Concorde crash legal team. &#8220;And he always keeps the bigger
picture in mind.&#8221;

Verdicts/Settlements 
Wells Fargo Wins Minnesota Verdict on Punitive Damages 
Wells Fargo  Co. won a jury decision yesterday rejecting
punitive damages above the $30.1 million awarded to four
Minnesota nonprofits that claimed the bank marketed a risky
securities-lending program it portrayed as safe. 
The nonprofits asked the jury to impose at least $100
million in punitive damages in the second phase of the trial
yesterday. Wells Fargo argued that no punitives were warranted
in the case. 
A state court jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, found Wells
Fargo liable for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Minnesota&#8217;s consumer fraud act on June 2. 
The Minnesota Workers&#8217; Compensation Reinsurance Association
and three charitable foundations sued in 2008, claiming the bank
failed to disclose the deteriorating value of the investments
until it was too late and blocked them from getting out of the
program. 
The case is Workers Compensation Reinsurance Association v.
Wells Fargo Bank, 62-cv-08-10825, District Court, Ramsey County,
Minnesota (St. Paul).

JPMorgan London Unit Gets Record Fine From U.K.&#8217;s FSA 
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s London unit was fined a record 33.3
million pounds ($48.8 million) by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator
for not properly separating client money from the firm&#8217;s
accounts. 
An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement yesterday. As much as $23 billion of client money held
by the bank&#8217;s futures and options business wasn&#8217;t put in
separate overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the
FSA said. 
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman&#8217;s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. 
&#8220;The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected,&#8221; said
Margaret Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement director. &#8220;This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline.&#8221; 
Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. 
JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA&#8217;s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients&#8217; money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts.

Ex-NeuTec Executive, Two Lawyers Cleared in FSA Case 
NeuTec Pharma Ltd.&#8217;s former chief financial officer and two
lawyers were cleared of insider-trading charges yesterday by a
London court, handing the U.K. financial regulator its first
defeat in a criminal case. 
Andrew King, the former CFO of Novartis AG&#8217;s NeuTec unit,
and Michael McFall, a former mergers lawyer at McDermott Will 
Emery LLP were cleared by a London jury. The judge told the jury
to find Andrew Rimmington, another lawyer whose case was halted
last month after his brother was killed, not guilty after they
gave their verdicts on the other two men. 
Wallace said she was &#8220;delighted&#8221; with the verdict. 
&#8220;We always believed the FSA&#8217;s case against him was flawed
but Mr. King has faced a long fight to clear his name and he and
his family have faced years of worry,&#8221; Wallace, a partner at
Irwin Mitchell LLP in London, said in a statement. &#8220;Having
worked with them throughout this, we are very pleased that they
can now move on with their lives.&#8221; 
McFall declined to comment outside the courtroom. 
&#8220;Insider dealing cases are challenging to prove, but these
were serious charges and we considered that the evidence
provided a proper basis to put the case before a jury for them
to decide,&#8221; Margaret Cole, the FSA enforcement director, said
in a statement. &#8220;Criminal prosecutions are integral to the
FSA&#8217;s long-term strategy of delivering credible deterrence and
combating insider dealing.&#8221; 
Prosecutor Michael Bowes said during the trial that the two
lawyers made 39,000 pounds each ($57,000) in June 2006 after
King gave McFall an early warning about Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis&#8217;s plan to purchase NeuTec. McFall gave the information
to Rimmington, Bowes said.

Ladbrokes, Betfair Lose Dutch Betting-Ban EU Appeal 
Ladbrokes Plc, owner of more than 2,700 betting shops, and
Betfair Ltd. lost a European Union court challenge to Dutch
rules blocking them from opening their websites to gamblers in
the Netherlands. 
&#8220;This prohibition may, on account of the specific features
associated with the provision of games of chance on the
Internet, be regarded as justified by the objective of combating
fraud and crime,&#8221; the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
said yesterday in a ruling that applies to the EU&#8217;s 27 nations
and can&#8217;t be appealed. 
Ladbrokes and Betfair have been fighting in Dutch courts
for at least seven years seeking to overcome the government&#8217;s
refusal to grant them licenses or allow citizens access to their
services. Dutch courts handling the cases sought guidance from
the EU tribunal on the legality of the policy. 
At least 11 cases over challenges to German, Austrian and
Swedish gambling restrictions are pending at the EU court.
Germany and Sweden are among countries which have been
threatened by the European Commission to loosen some of their
restrictions and some recently started to do so. 
Ladbrokes said in an e-mailed statement it was
&#8220;confident&#8221; that the ruling will lead to a detailed assessment
in the Dutch courts. 
&#8220;The Ladbrokes and Betfair cases have clearly demonstrated
the fragility of the entire Dutch legal framework in relation to
gambling,&#8221; said John O&#8217;Reilly, a managing director at
Ladbrokes. 
Yesterday&#8217;s ruling &#8220;once again demonstrates the need for
the&#8221; commission &#8220;to take a lead on this issue, so that we can
separate fact from fiction and settle the online gambling debate
once and for all,&#8221; said Tim Phillips, a Betfair spokesman, in
an e-mailed statement. 
The cases are C-203/08 The Sporting Exchange Ltd, trading
under the name &#8216;Betfair&#8217; v. Minister for Justice, Stichting de
Nationale Sporttotalisator and Scientific Games Racing; C-258/08
Ladbrokes Betting  Gaming Ltd. and Ladbrokes International Ltd.
v. Stichting de Nationale Sporttotalisator.

New Suits 
Philip Morris, Reynolds Sue New York for Smoking Ads 
U.S. cigarette makers Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. sued New York, alleging the city&#8217;s mandated anti-
smoking ads violate their First Amendment rights and are
preempted by federally mandated warnings. 
The cigarette makers and Lorillard Tobacco Co. allege in a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
that the city&#8217;s graphic health-warning signs force them to carry
messages they wouldn&#8217;t carry at the point of sale. The signs
show cancerous lungs, a decayed tooth and a brain damaged by
stroke and bear the message &#8220;Quit Smoking Today.&#8221; 
The companies, joined by state retail associations, seek a
court order to stop New York from enforcing the law. The city
resolution, amended in September, requires that any business
selling tobacco &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; to consumers also prominently
display the tobacco health-warning signs. 
&#8220;Through words and imagery, the signs urge consumers not
to purchase plaintiffs&#8217; products,&#8221; the cigarette makers said.
&#8220;The mandated signs also restrict plaintiffs&#8217; ability to
communicate about lawful products with their adult customers.&#8221; 
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman with the city&#8217;s Law
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that her office is
reviewing the complaint. 
&#8220;However, while these proposed changes were under
consideration, we carefully considered all of the legal issues,
as well as comments we received from the public,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We are confident that the health code provisions being
challenged will withstand legal scrutiny.&#8221; 
The case is Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. New York City Board of
Health, 10-cv-4392, U.S. District Court (Manhattan). 
BanxCorp Sues Dow Jones, New York Times Over Rate Sites 
BanxCorp, operator of the BanxQuote website, sued media
companies including News Corp.&#8217;s Dow Jones  Co. and New York
Times Co., accusing them of forming a cartel to sell information
on bank interest rates on their websites. 
BanxCorp on June 2 added the companies, as well as AOL
Inc., to an antitrust lawsuit filed on May 14 against Tree.com
Inc.&#8217;s LendingTree LLC in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. 
The companies conspired with BanxQuote competitor Bankrate
Inc. to &#8220;gain an unfair advantage over the plaintiff&#8221; by
fixing the prices banks pay to have rates listed on websites,
according to the complaint. BanxCorp, based in Scarsdale, New
York, estimates damages at more than $500 million. 
Financial institutions pay to list their interest rates on
websites run by BanxCorp and Bankrate, then consumers use the
sites to find the most competitive rates for financial products
such as certificates of deposit and mortgages. The media
companies republish the data. 
The other defendants named are General Electric Co.&#8217;s CNBC,
Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Cable News Network, Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s and
GE&#8217;s MSNBC Interactive News LLC, News Corp.&#8217;s Fox News Network
and Move Inc. 
Jack Horner, a News Corp. spokesman; Sara Anissipour, an
outside spokeswoman for Microsoft; and Anne Eisele of GE, Alysia
Lew of AOL and Julie Reynolds of Move.com said their companies
had no comment. 
&#8220;We haven&#8217;t been served and haven&#8217;t seen the complaint,&#8221;
Diane McNulty, a New York Times spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
Mona Marimow of LendingTree and Christa Robinson of CNN didn&#8217;t
return messages for comment. 
BanxCorp also sued Bankrate in federal court in New Jersey.
That suit is pending, BanxCorp Chief Executive Officer Norbert
Mehl said in a telephone interview. 
The case is BanxCorp v. LendingTree LLC, 10-02467, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Miami Beach Hotel Developers Enter Not Guilty Pleas 
Two Miami Beach hotel developers pleaded not guilty
yesterday to charges of hiding more than $150 million in assets
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
were indicted May 25 on charges of conspiracy and filing false
tax returns. They face as long as 14 years in prison if
convicted. 
The pair is accused of using shell companies such as
American Leisure Resorts Inc. as part of a conspiracy to conceal
their ownership of a $45 million investment portfolio, $55
million in commercial properties in Miami Beach, homes in New
York and Florida, and cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a
Porsche Carrera GT and Ferrari Testarossa. They failed to pay
taxes on their assets, prosecutors said. 
The Cohens were arrested April 15 as part of a tax-day
sweep targeting offshore tax evasion. U.S. Magistrate Judge
Lurana Snow in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 20 ordered the
two men held without bail, saying they posed a flight risk. 
The Cohens developed high-end hotels under the name
Flatotel International. After selling the New York Flatotel in
2000, they used &#8220;numerous nominee and shell corporations&#8221; to
hide $33 million in proceeds from tax collectors, prosecutors
said in the indictment. 
The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).

Infineon Loses Bid to Dismiss Lawsuit in Canada Court 
Infineon Technologies AG and other computer memory
manufacturers lost a bid at Canada&#8217;s top court to throw out a
group lawsuit claiming they fixed prices and overcharged
customers between 1999 and 2002. 
The Supreme Court of Canada yesterday denied the
chipmakers&#8217; request for a hearing, upholding a British Columbia
Court of Appeal ruling that allowed the suit to proceed. 
Infineon, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Samsung Electronics
Co. were sued in British Columbia after having pleaded guilty in
the U.S. to criminal charges arising from an international
conspiracy to fix prices of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, computer chips. The companies weren&#8217;t charged in Canada
and haven&#8217;t paid any fines to regulators. 
Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd., a Richmond, British Columbia,
computer consulting company, sued Infineon, Hynix, Samsung and
Micron Technology Inc. on behalf of all buyers of the memory in
the province, claiming it paid more for the memory chips that it
should have because the companies fixed prices. They seek to
recover damages, including restitution for unjust enrichment and
an order for the companies to give up profits earned. 
The companies claimed a group, or class-action, suit was
improper because each customer would have to prove damages
individually. Supreme Court of British Columbia Judge David
Masuhara agreed with the companies and dismissed the suit. He
also ruled Pro-Sys wouldn&#8217;t fairly or adequately represent the
interests of the class. 
The Court of Appeal overturned the decision, unanimously
saying liability can be determined on a common basis &#8220;without
resort to individualized inquiries,&#8221; and a class suit was
preferable. 
The case is Infineon Technologies AG v. Pro-Sys Consultants
Ltd., 33522, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa).

Trials/Appeals 
JJ Misled Pennsylvania on Drug&#8217;s Risks, Lawyer Says 
A Johnson  Johnson unit misled Pennsylvania officials
about the health risks of its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug and
duped the state into paying $289 million more than it should
have for the medicine, a lawyer said. 
Pennsylvania officials wouldn&#8217;t have paid a premium for
Risperdal had they known it was no more effective than existing
anti-psychotic drugs and was found to cause diabetes, Fletch
Trammell, a lawyer for the state, told a Philadelphia jury
yesterday. Pennsylvania is seeking to recover $289 million it
paid for Risperdal prescriptions. 
&#8220;There were a dozen anti-psychotics that were just as good
as Risperdal and cost a fraction&#8221; as much, Trammell said in
opening statements in the trial of the state&#8217;s rebate lawsuit
against JJ. 
JJ&#8217;s lawyer contended in his opening statement that the
drugmaker did nothing wrong in marketing Risperdal to state-
sponsored health-care programs. 
&#8220;There is no merit in the case that&#8221; the state will
present, Thomas Campion, JJ&#8217;s lawyer, told jurors yesterday. 
&#8220;We have always been committed to ethical business
practices and we are fully prepared to defend ourselves against
these claims,&#8221; Greg Panico, a JJ spokesman, said in a written
statement.

Court News 
New Orleans Judge Sells Bonds to Avoid Spill Conflict 
A New Orleans federal judge said he sold his investments in
companies tied to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to avoid any
conflict of interest in presiding over lawsuits involving spill-
damage claims. 
&#8220;So there is no perception of a conflict in these cases,
yesterday I instructed my broker to sell the few Transocean and
Halliburton bonds in my account,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier said in an e-mail yesterday. 
BP Plc and Transocean Ltd. oil-spill lawsuits may be
combined before a judge from outside the Gulf Coast states,
because judges in the region are withdrawing from cases, citing
conflicts of interest. 
Six of 12 active judges assigned to the federal judicial
district based in New Orleans already have removed themselves
from spill-damage lawsuits, according to a court official and
public records. The judges found conflicts tied to oil
investments or personal relationships with lawyers or companies
involved. 
Several additional federal judges in districts based in
Lafayette, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida,
have also disqualified themselves from oil-spill cases,
according to public records. 
Barbier&#8217;s portfolio contained Transocean Sedco Forex notes
and Halliburton Co. debentures, according to financial
disclosure forms posted by Judicial Watch, a self-styled
conservative advocacy group based in Washington. 
More than 170 proposed class-action lawsuits, representing
potentially thousands of claims, have been filed in courthouses
from Texas to Florida. BP, the owner of the offshore lease, and
Transocean, the rig owner, are named in virtually all the cases.
Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which provided cementing
services to the well, and Cameron International Corp., which
supplied blowout prevention equipment, are also named in most of
the lawsuits. 
The case is In re Oil Spill By the Oil Rig &#8220;Deepwater
Horizon&#8221; in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, U.S. Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation, MDL-2179, Washington.

Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts
for Asian currencies, including the South Korean won and the
Indian rupee, as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis saps demand for the
region&#8217;s exports. 
The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the

eight-month low on May 25 as concern Europe&#8217;s funding woes will
slow a recovery wiped more than $4 trillion from the value of
global equities last month. The euro dropped to its lowest level
in four years against the dollar before the Group of 20 nations
gathers today in South Korea to discuss the currency&#8217;s decline. 
&#8220;A weak euro and fiscal drag in Euroland will impart
weaker external-demand conditions for Asian currencies ex-
Japan,&#8221; analysts Stewart Newnham and Yee Wai Chong wrote in a
report dated yesterday. &#8220;We are mindful that if China slows too,
this would further soften the regional currency outlook.&#8221; 
South Korea&#8217;s won will likely strengthen to 1,175 per
dollar by year-end, compared with an earlier forecast of 1,050,
the report said. The currency closed trading at 1,201.80 in
Seoul today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India&#8217;s
rupee may climb to 46 and the Singapore dollar to S$1.39. The
bank&#8217;s previous estimates were 43.50 and S$1.32. 
The rupee dropped 0.6 percent this week to 46.63 against
the dollar and the Singapore dollar lost 0.2 percent to S$1.40.
The won fell 0.6 percent. 
The Asia Dollar Index reached 108.77 on May 25, the lowest
level since Sept. 15. The euro touched $1.2111 on June 1, the
weakest since April 14, 2006. 
Tightening Delays 
Overseas shipments to Europe range from 9 percent to 27
percent of exports from Asian countries, with India sending 27
percent, China 23 percent and the Philippines 16 percent, the
report said. 
Asian currencies may become less attractive to investors as
central banks delay raising interest rates, Morgan Stanley said.
Asia, powered by China&#8217;s booming economy, has been leading the
global economic recovery, where countries including Malaysia and
India have increased borrowing costs. 
Central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines kept
interest rates at record lows yesterday and Thailand left
borrowing costs unchanged a day earlier, as policy makers judged
the European crisis to be a bigger risk to their economies than
inflation. 
China&#8217;s economic growth may slow to 9 percent in 2011 from
an estimate of 11 percent in 2010, according to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
report. 
&#8220;Asian currencies ex-Japan may also lose the support from
a monetary tightening bias,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said. 
Developing Asia will expand 8.7 percent in 2011, outpacing
global growth of 4.3 percent, according to estimates from the
International Monetary Fund on April 21.

Morgan Stanley plans to double its
private bankers in Asia over the next three years as Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman aims to boost profits from the
global wealth management unit that he&#8217;d previously helmed. 
The company plans to hire almost 100 bankers in the region
this year, Charles Mak, head of private wealth management for
Asia, said in an interview. It also appointed Nick Chan, an ex-
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who was running New York-based
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Indonesian private bank, to a newly-created
recruiting and staff development role for Mak&#8217;s group this year. 
&#8220;This will be our most aggressive expansion in the private
wealth space in Asia,&#8221; Mak said by telephone from Hong Kong.
&#8220;This region has the best economic growth, the highest levels
of wealth creation, and many players are coming to this part of
the world, or are expanding.&#8221; 
The bank is competing with rivals including UBS AG,
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd.
to hire financial advisers in a market with an estimated $7.4
trillion of private riches. Growth in the region&#8217;s wealth will
outstrip the global average as its economies outperform,
Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management said in October. 
Morgan Stanley provides services for the so-called ultra-
high net worth segment in Asia, aiming at clients who have at
least $10 million in wealth. In India and Australia, it also
targets people starting with $1 million or more. 
Global Operations 
Separately today, Morgan Stanley said its Asia chairman
Stephen Roach will relocate to New York from Hong Kong and
become its non-executive chairman for Asia. The move will take
effect on July 1. 
Pretax profit for Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global-wealth management
unit more than doubled to $278 million for the first quarter.
The company paid $2.75 billion in cash in June 2009 to create
the world&#8217;s largest brokerage by gaining control of Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney and the biggest U.S. team of financial
advisers. 
Gorman, who led the brokerage before succeeding John Mack
at the helm of Morgan Stanley in January, said in a letter to
shareholders in April that the joint venture will play &#8220;an
increasingly important role in our growth and profitability.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney President Charles Johnston has
said the venture will look to expand outside the U.S. because
those markets are set to grow faster. The unit employed about
18,140 advisers globally and managed client assets of about $1.6
trillion at the end of the quarter, Morgan Stanley said April 21. 
Chan, 39, will relocate to Hong Kong from Singapore next
week. He joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 with three of his five-
member team from Goldman Sachs. He had previously overseen the
private banking business in Indonesia from Singapore for Goldman
Sachs, after starting his career in investment banking with
Smith Barney Asia Inc. in 1994 in Hong Kong.

An experimental pill from Pfizer Inc.
shrank tumors in patients with a rare form of lung cancer that
is caused by a defective gene and occurs mostly in nonsmokers, a
study showed. 
The medicine, crizotinib, reduced tumor size in 57 percent
of patients and stopped the progression of the disease in 87
percent of those in a study released today at the meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Most of the
trial&#8217;s participants never smoked or were former smokers. 
Pfizer&#8217;s drug is the only compound in human testing to
target a defect in a gene called ALK, which can turn deadly when
a piece of it breaks away and fuses with a neighboring gene,
causing cells to grow out of control, said Alice Shaw, a
thoracic cancer specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. The gene flaw occurs in about 5 percent of lung cancer
patients. If effective in larger studies, the drug could be
available in 2013 and generate annual sales of $800 million,
said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler, in a note to clients. 
&#8220;The drug has shown remarkable activity against tumors,&#8221;
said Shaw, one of the study&#8217;s researchers. &#8220;As a lung cancer
doctor, you just don&#8217;t see changes like this in patients.&#8221; 
Crizotinib is among 24 new tumor-fighting medicines that
New York-based Pfizer is developing to help offset the $11
billion in revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies of its cholesterol pill Lipitor enter the market. 
Countering Setbacks 
Investor confidence in Pfizer&#8217;s ability to replace that
revenue with new medicines has waned following some research
failures this year, said Trevor Polischuk, an analyst with
OrbiMed Advisors LLC in New York. Data on crizotinib and at
least four other experimental drugs that Pfizer will report on
at the cancer meeting may help to restore some of that
confidence, he said. 
&#8220;What ASCO can do is remind people that there is a
pipeline there and opportunity there,&#8221; Polischuk said in a
telephone interview. 
In March, the company said its experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s drug
Dimedon, which analysts said could have generated $5 billion in
annual sales, failed to help patients in a late-stage study.
That same month, the company said Sutent, approved for kidney
and stomach cancers, failed in two studies to shrink tumors of
the breast, and its experimental drug figitumumab didn&#8217;t help
lung cancer patients. 
The results released today on crizotinib are from the
second of three stages of study required to get U.S. regulatory
clearance. More than 100 patients have been treated with the
drug and Pfizer has evaluated 82 patients for a response. The
drug has now advanced into final testing and the company plans
to seek U.S. approval for crizotinib in the first half of 2011,
Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said. 
Cancer Killer 
Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn&#8217;t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. About 15 percent of lung cancer cases worldwide occur
in patients with no history of smoking. 
The defective gene that crizotinib is designed to thwart
occurs in about 6,000 cancer patients a year in the U.S., said
Shaw. It is believed to be most common in people who have never
smoked and are middle-age, she said. 
One such patient, Linnea Duff, an artist who lives in New
Hampshire, was among the first to receive the experimental pill.
At age 45, Duff, who had never smoked, was diagnosed with lung
cancer and given a 15 percent chance of living five years.
Available treatments failed to help her and she was preparing to
die when given her first dose of the drug in September 2008. 
&#8216;Blew Everyone Away&#8217; 
A few days later she noticed her cough went away and she
was no longer out of breath. Seven weeks later, a scan showed
that her lung tumor, which had marched through every other
treatment, had disappeared. The results &#8220;blew everyone away,&#8221;
she said. 
&#8220;Before this drug, it was definitely the end of my life. I
was seeing a psychiatrist at the hospital to try to deal with
this and try to prepare,&#8221; Duff recalls. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve returned to
that state of mind where I think about the future again. I&#8217;ve
gotten back into the habit of making plans and in September I&#8217;m
going to Sweden with my oldest son.&#8221; 
The early research that led to the development of
crizotinib was started by Sugen Inc., a Redwood City,
California-based biotechnology company that also discovered the
kidney cancer treatment Sutent. Sugen was acquired by Pharmacia
 Upjohn Inc. in 1999 for $650 million and Pfizer acquired
Pharmacia in 2003 for $58 billion. Pfizer researchers in La
Jolla, California then picked up the research and developed the
compound used in today&#8217;s study. 
Blocking Cell Signals 
When Pfizer first started developing crizotinib, they knew
it could block the signals from the defective ALK gene and a
protein called c-MET, and they believed it could help patients
with lymphoma and sarcoma. What they didn&#8217;t know was that it
could also be a potential treatment for lung cancer patients.
Then, in August 2007 a study by Japanese researchers found the
defect in a lung cancer patient. 
That discovery sent Shaw and her team of researchers
scrambling to find lung cancer patients to add to the study and
four months later they started testing the drug in lung cancer.
Duff was one of those that Shaw initially recruited. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, has been throwing
its weight behind cancer research since 2008 hoping to grab a
larger share of the $53 billion market for cancer drugs. The
company created a division focused on discovering and selling
medicine for cancer in 2008 and spends about a quarter of its $8
billion research budget on cancer research. 
Other Research 
Pfizer also released data today from a separate study that
found patients taking a lung cancer treatment called PF-299
lived a month longer without their disease worsening than those
taking Roche Holding AG&#8217;s Tarceva. The study followed 188
patients for an average of 12 weeks and was part of the second
of three stages of testing required to get FDA approval.
Patients taking Pfizer&#8217;s drug were more likely to have diarrhea,
acne or a rash. 
On June 7, Pfizer will present data at the cancer meeting
showing that leukemia patients who failed to benefit from or
were unable to tolerate Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG&#8217;s
Gleevec responded to its experimental treatment bosutinib. The
drug is being studied in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
and is now in the final stages of testing. 
Pfizer has been trying to take a more targeted approach to
its cancer research by matching its drugs to a specific tumor&#8217;s
traits. In the case of crizotinib, Pfizer has partnered with
rival drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, based in Abbott Park,
Illinois, to develop a test to detect which patients have the
gene flaw that the drug targets. 
&#8216;Biological Insights&#8217; 
&#8220;We are trying to bring more focus to drug development
based on genetic and biological insights from the cancer,&#8221; said
Mace Rothenberg, Pfizer&#8217;s vice president of clinical affairs for
cancer. &#8220;This is what patients will value because the goal will
be to deliver drugs to patients who are most likely to benefit
and patients won&#8217;t be exposed to potentially toxic drugs
unnecessarily.&#8221; 
Researchers for the past decade have been trying to figure
out why certain treatments work in some patients and not in
others. For instance, Tarceva from Basel, Switzerland-based
Roche Holding AG and Iressa from London-based AstraZeneca Plc
work best in patients with a certain mutation called EGFR that
occurs in about 10 percent of lung cancer cases. 
&#8220;Ten years ago, no matter what the type of tumor, patients
were all getting chemo,&#8221; said Mark Kris, a lung cancer
specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. &#8220;Science now tells us that that isn&#8217;t the way it should
be. Just like we are all individuals, cancer is individual too
and we need to treat the cancer in that person.&#8221; 
Not a Cure 
Crizotinib isn&#8217;t a cure for most patients as tumors are
expected to eventually develop a resistance to the treatment,
said Shaw. After 19 months on the pill, Duff says that her
cancer is now back. She is still taking the drug in hopes it
will slow progression enough for her to be able to get into a
trial for a similar-acting drug. 
The side effects from the drug are mild and less than seen
with other cancer therapies, said Rothenberg. The most common
side effects are loss of appetite and in some cases patients&#8217;
night vision is distorted, according to the study. 
The current treatments for lung cancer include surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation and targeted drug therapies, led by
Roche&#8217;s Avastin and Tarceva.

Doctors treating brain cancer have a
limited toolkit. They can cut tumors out with a knife, burn them
with radiation or try to poison them with drugs. 
NovoCure Ltd., a closely held Israeli company, has added a
fourth option for hard-to-treat tumors. It&#8217;s an array of
electrodes resembling a tight-fitting helmet that bathes the
cancer in a faint electric field, scrambling the inner workings
of the rampaging cells and preventing them from multiplying. 
The helmet, powered by a 6-pound battery pack, is designed
to zap deadly glioblastomas, the malignancy that killed U.S.
Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009. In a study reported today,
it helped patients with recurrent tumors live 7.8 months,
compared with a median 6.1 months for patients given the best
available chemotherapies or Roche AG&#8217;s Avastin. 
The technology is so different from other treatments, it
was difficult to convince patients and doctors to try it, said
Philip Gutin, primary investigator for the study. &#8220;This new
data actually shows that it&#8217;s effective,&#8221; said Gutin, the chair
of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. &#8220;People will ask for this now.&#8221; 
The electric fields resonate at a frequency designed to do
no harm to healthy brain tissue. In the test, the only side
effect was mild scalp irritation, Gutin said. &#8220;If it continues
to look as good as it does, it will be used in lots of different
treatments. There&#8217;s no downside to it.&#8221; 
The study, reported at the American Society of Clinical
Oncology in Chicago, followed 237 very sick patients whose
cancers had returned after prior treatment and whose tumors, on
average, were 4 centimeters (1.57 inches) in diameter. 
Topping Chemotherapy 
The study was designed to show that patients using the
helmet fared significantly better than those taking chemotherapy
and Avastin. On this basis, it was a failure. That&#8217;s because
more than 50 patients either died or dropped out before they
completed the first round of treatment, said Eilon Kirson, head
of NovoCure&#8217;s research and development. 
When those patients are excluded from both arms of the
analysis, the helmet performed better than other treatments,
Kirson said. Under either analysis, the trial found the helmet
to be at least as good as other approaches, but without the
vomiting, fatigue and infections associated with chemotherapy. 
While shooting electricity through the brain conjures
images of Mary Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Frankenstein,&#8221; or the involuntary
electroshock therapy in Ken Kesey&#8217;s &#8220;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#8217;s
Nest,&#8221; Kirson emphasized that NovoCure&#8217;s technology is new. The
helmet is the first cancer therapy to use alternating polarities
in electric fields as a way to disrupt the cell division process
known as mitosis. 
&#8220;Bad Name&#8221; 
&#8220;Electricity has gotten a bad name in medicine in the last
century or two,&#8221; Kirson said in a telephone interview. &#8220;People
hear &#8216;electric fields&#8217; and of course they are skeptical. In
order to cross that barrier into biology and medicine, we had to
start at the end. The end is glioblastoma.&#8221; 
NovoCure, based in Haifa, was started by Yoram Palti, a
professor of electrophysiology and biophysics at Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology. Early funding came from Bill Doyle,
founder of investment firm WFD Ventures and now chairman of
NovoCure. Pfizer Inc. and Johnson  Johnson are also investors,
according to a NovoCure statement. 
Early prototypes were cumbersome for patients, weighing
about 15 pounds, Kirson said. The current battery pack looks
like a white laptop computer that slips into a shoulder bag, and
the company plans to shrink the device further. 
Patients wore NovoCure&#8217;s helmet for about 20 hours a day,
shaving their heads twice weekly before reapplying the electrode
patches. The patients were able to conduct most of their usual
routine with the machine and took occasional breaks for athletic
or social events. 
&#8220;A Nice Shower&#8221; 
&#8220;We have a patient who plays tennis,&#8221; Kirson said.
&#8220;Whenever she replaces her electrodes, she goes and plays
tennis for a couple of hours, she has a nice shower, she goes
into the sauna, and when she gets out she&#8217;ll put it back on and
keep going.&#8221; Now NovoCure is testing the helmet simultaneously
with chemotherapy in early cases of glioblastoma with hope that
a combination will enhance the effectiveness of both treatments. 
NovoCure is using today&#8217;s trial to apply for U.S. marketing
approval, and the company seeks to begin U.S. sales next year,
Kirson said. The helmet is already approved for use in Europe,
though health plans there won&#8217;t currently pay the $10,000 to
$15,000 a month it costs to wear it. 
NovoCure is testing similar devices for other types of
hard-to-treat cancer. The results of a test in 42 lung cancer
patients will likely be released at the European Society of
Medical Oncology meeting in September, Kirson said. 
&#8220;I must admit that when I first saw this I thought it was
complete and utter trash -- I&#8217;m being that honest about it,&#8221;
Kirson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a novel technology, you have to show
that you are the real thing. The real reason I went into this
was because I had worked with Professor Palti, and I believed in
him. I thought he was a brilliant man, and I still do.&#8221;

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
subpoenaed by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission after
panel members said the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history engaged in a document &#8220;dump&#8221; to hinder a probe. 
Goldman Sachs sent more than a billion pages of documents,
FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas said on a conference call with
reporters today. Not all of the information is what the panel
requested, and Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t cooperate with requests to
interview Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides said. 
&#8220;We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish,&#8221; said Angelides, 56, who
previously served as California&#8217;s treasurer. &#8220;This has been a
very deliberate effort over time to run out the clock.&#8221; 
The FCIC, which Congress appointed last year to investigate
the causes of the worst economic slump since the Great
Depression, issued the subpoena June 4. The request adds to
government scrutiny of New York-based Goldman Sachs, as
regulators and lawmakers examine how it packaged mortgages into
securities that fueled investor losses when the housing market
collapsed in 2007.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being
&#8220;legitimately scrutinized&#8221; by regulators who sued the firm for
fraud based on conduct that many in the industry consider to be
common practice, according to a Bloomberg survey. 
The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
has suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to the global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. Eighty-
three percent of respondents said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stature
diminished in the past six months; the next closest were UBS AG,
with 27 percent, and Citigroup Inc., at 26 percent. 
&#8220;This disaster didn&#8217;t occur by mistake,&#8221; said respondent
Dane Fulmer, who has traded fixed-income financial instruments
for 39 years and runs Dane Fulmer Investments in Fort Smith,
Arkansas. &#8220;If it was an honest mistake, then it far, far
surpasses what the law would consider negligent.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which said the New York-based company
failed to inform investors about the role hedge fund Paulson 
Co. played in both helping to select contracts underlying a
mortgage-linked investment and betting against it. Goldman Sachs
has said it did nothing wrong and is fighting the case. 
Asked for their opinion of the SEC fraud suit, 61 percent
of respondents replied that the firm &#8220;is being legitimately
scrutinized,&#8221; while 29 percent answered that the company &#8220;is
being unfairly vilified.&#8221; The remainder were undecided. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the poll. 
Views of Goldman Sachs and its outlook were more negative
outside the U.S., where 69 percent of respondents found the SEC
suit to be reasonable, compared with 48 percent of people polled
in the U.S. 
Common Practice 
About three-quarters of the people in all regions who said
they thought the SEC&#8217;s case was justifiable also said the
alleged behavior is common practice. 
&#8220;Complex transactions that may appear to some to be
malicious likely occur at every large investment house on the
Street,&#8221; said respondent Eric McCarthy, an analyst at a U.S.
hedge fund. 
Leverage derived from packaging subprime mortgage debt into
collateralized debt obligations and related derivatives, such as
the transaction at the center of the SEC&#8217;s suit against Goldman
Sachs, magnified losses in the mortgage market and contributed
to the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. The crisis
led to an unprecedented taxpayer-funded bailout of banks,
including Goldman Sachs, which repaid its $10 billion capital
injection, with interest, last year. 
Clients Second 
Gala Prada, a fund manager at Fiatc Mutua de Seguros y
Reaseguros in Barcelona, an insurer with 1 billion euros ($1.2
billion) in assets, agreed that Goldman&#8217;s conduct wasn&#8217;t
unusual. 
&#8220;Investment banks, not only Goldman, first do their own
proper account trades and only then advise their clients to do
whatever is in their best interest, and I mean in the investment
bank&#8217;s interest,&#8221; Prada said. 
The outlook for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock and management was
more optimistic in the U.S., where more than half of those
polled said Lloyd Blankfein would remain chairman, compared with
36 percent of non-U.S. respondents who said so. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re a Goldman shareholder or a Goldman employee, by
and large you have been well served by the management team
relative to the environment and relative to the competition,&#8221;
said Brenden Smith, founder and principal of San Francisco-based
Cypress Capital Management LP and a former Goldman Sachs
employee. 
$13.4 Billion Profit 
Goldman set a profit record for a stand-alone U.S.
securities firm in 2007, when it earned $11.6 billion. In 2009,
after converting to a bank holding company, the firm topped its
previous record with $13.4 billion in profit. 
Three-quarters of respondents said they believe that
Goldman Sachs will settle the charges, with a plurality of 40
percent saying the issue would then dissipate, compared with 34
percent who said the damage to the firm would be lasting. About
34 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they thought the bad
publicity would blow over after the firm settles the suit. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a real break between perceptions inside the U.S.
and outside the U.S.,&#8221; said J. Ann Selzer, president of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Selzer  Co., which conducted the survey.
&#8220;If you just look at the U.S. customers, they see these current
troubles as temporary and predict the firm will exit standing
tall.&#8221; 
Blankfein&#8217;s Future 
The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders
and analysts in six continents was conducted June 2-3. It is
based on interviews with a random sample of 1,001 Bloomberg
subscribers, representing decision makers in markets, finance
and economics. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.1 percentage points. 
While 36 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they expect
Blankfein to remain as chairman, half of those polled said they
didn&#8217;t expect any major changes to the firm&#8217;s leadership as a
result of the lawsuit. A bigger proportion of U.S. subscribers,
59 percent, didn&#8217;t expect major changes, compared with 44
percent of people outside the U.S. 
Still, Blankfein was viewed unfavorably by 56 percent of
poll respondents, second only to BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward&#8217;s 65
percent among a list of 10 public figures that included
President Barack Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Goldman&#8217;s stock, which ended New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday at $138.68, has fallen 25 percent
since the suit was filed, and 41 percent of the people surveyed
said they are &#8220;generally bullish&#8221; on the shares. Forty percent
said they&#8217;re &#8220;generally bearish.&#8221; Fifty-four percent of U.S.
investors were bullish, compared with 28 percent in Europe and
43 percent in Asia. 
&#8216;Money Machine&#8217; 
&#8220;I&#8217;m bullish on it, I actually bought it,&#8221; said
respondent Carey Chapman, treasurer of the Asheboro, North
Carolina-based bank CommunityOne, part of FNB United Corp.
&#8220;They&#8217;re just a money machine, they know how to make money.&#8221; 
Much of the criticism is politically motivated, he added. 
&#8220;The Obama administration is trying to build a case
against Wall Street to push the financial legislation,&#8221; Chapman
said. 
Fallout Modest 
Yesterday, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a panel
appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the economic
slump, said it subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the firm didn&#8217;t
follow its requests, deliberately producing so many documents
that investigators cannot quickly sort them. 
Goldman said it is &#8220;committed to providing the FCIC with
the information they have requested.&#8221; That inquiry is separate
from the SEC&#8217;s case. 
Spain&#8217;s Prada said the fallout from the SEC lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs would be modest. 
&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s going to be business as
usual,&#8221; Prada said.

Coca-Cola Co. will pay $715 million
for the rights to distribute some Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.
brands, in a new agreement prompted by the acquisition of its
largest bottler. 
The cash payment will allow Coca-Cola to sell brands
including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry in some regions of the U.S.
and Canada for 20 years, the Atlanta-based company said today in
a statement. Dr Pepper also takes back the distribution of some
brands. 
Dr Pepper renegotiated its distribution contracts with
Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest soda maker, and PepsiCo Inc.
after both companies agreed to buy bottlers. PepsiCo paid $900
million this year to distribute some Dr Pepper drinks. The Coca-
Cola payment announced today is close to an estimate by Carlos Laboy, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. 
&#8220;The terms and cash amount are in-line with the previous
deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a
higher payment to come from Coke,&#8221; Laboy said today in a note.
He has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on Dr Pepper stock and
doesn&#8217;t rate Coca-Cola. 
Dr Pepper, based in Plano, Texas, fell 64 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $35.85 at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Coca-Cola dropped 47 cents to $50.80. 
Coca-Cola agreed to buy Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North
American bottling unit in February. The distribution deal will
replace those between Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola Enterprises when
the acquisition closes later this year, Coca-Cola said. 
Freestyle Fountain 
The payment is lower than the $900 million estimated by
Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst with UBS AG in New York. The
difference will be made up largely by Coca-Cola&#8217;s agreement to
give Dr Pepper access to fountain drink accounts and put Dr
Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its new Freestyle fountain,
Gajrawala said today in a note. He recommends buying Dr Pepper
and Coca-Cola shares. 
Dr Pepper, in a statement, valued the Freestyle access at
$115 million to $135 million. 
The Freestyle, a touch screen-controlled drink dispenser
that expands offerings to more than 100, will be available in at
least 500 U.S. outlets this summer, Coca-Cola said. 
Dr Pepper said it will take back distribution of Squirt,
Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler sold by Coca-Cola
Enterprises in certain U.S. territories. 
The agreement imposes new performance conditions on Coca-
Cola, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a call with
reporters, declining to provide further details. Fayard also
declined to say whether the new agreement includes a change-in-
control clause that would trigger a renegotiation should Coca-
Cola spin off the bottling operations. 
Coca-Cola bottlers distribute about 42 percent of the Dr
Pepper brand&#8217;s volume while PepsiCo distributes 39 percent,
Fayard said, citing statistics by industry newsletter Beverage
Digest.

Morgan Stanley slashed its forecasts
for Venezuela&#8217;s economy, saying it may contract this year and
next as higher oil prices fail to stimulate business and a
tightening of controls restricts access to foreign currency. 
Morgan Stanley now forecasts gross domestic product will
shrink 6.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2011, compared
with an earlier prediction for 0.3 percent growth this year and
3.5 percent expansion next year. 
&#8220;While most of Latin America, in line with the globe, has
been in recovery mode since last year, Venezuela has seen an
intensifying downturn in activity,&#8221; Daniel Volberg and Giuliana
Pardelli said in a report today. &#8220;Our new baseline of at least
three years of economic contraction suggests the risks to
Venezuela&#8217;s ability to honor its international financial
commitments may be on the rise.&#8221; 
Venezuela&#8217;s economy contracted 3.3 percent last year as
investment dried up following nationalizations and oil revenue
plunged on waning output and production cuts in line with OPEC
quotas. Morgan Stanley, based in New York, expects investment to
plunge 28.1 percent this year while private consumption drops
5.8 percent. 
President Hugo Chavez on May 18 closed the unregulated
currency market that companies used to buy dollars and ordered
the central bank to oversee the trading of dollar-denominated
securities that will be used to obtain currency at a government-
set exchange rate. 
Bolivar Devaluation 
Chavez devalued the bolivar as much as 50 percent on Jan. 8
to close a budget deficit and to slow capital flight, creating a
multi-tiered exchange system. 
The government&#8217;s Foreign Exchange Board pared dollar sales
at the official rates of 2.6 and 4.3 per dollar last year and
during the first three months of 2010, causing imports to
plummet 38 percent in the first quarter. 
While Venezuela may be successful in slowing capital flight
through the new currency market, imports will likely continue to
fall, Volberg and Pardelli said. 
&#8220;Given that imports have been essential in offsetting the
multi-year deterioration in domestic supply in Venezuela, the
restrictions may prove a significant negative supply shock for
the Venezuelan economy,&#8221; the analysts said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$716.3 million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages,
according to a person familiar with the offering. 
The transaction, which is the second of newly issued
commercial-mortgage backed bonds to be sold this year, consists
of 36 loans on 96 properties, said the person, who declined to
be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. 
Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7
million of the bonds in April. During the boom, sales grew as
large as $7.6 billion, the data show. 
Plunging property values have made it difficult for
borrowers to secure enough financing to retire maturing debt,
with prices down 42 percent from October 2007 peaks, according
to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. A record 7.02 percent of borrowers
are behind on payments, versus 1.87 percent a year ago,
according to Moody&#8217;s. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s offering consists of loans equal to 61.5 percent
of the value of the properties on average, the person said. In
2007, borrowers were able to take out loans equaling about 69.1
percent of a property&#8217;s value, according to Jefferies Group Inc.
data. 
Spreads to Treasuries 
The current ratio &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem all that much lower, but
the difference is today&#8217;s valuations,&#8221; said Lisa Pendergast, an
analyst at Jefferies in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;Property values
are no longer being driven by overly optimistic expectations on
cash flow and cheap and plentiful sources of capital.&#8221; 
Top-rated commercial-mortgage backed securities yield about
3.09 percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 8.03
percentage points over the benchmark a year ago, according to
Barclays PLC data. Lower spreads mean banks can offer more
attractive financing to borrowers. 
The largest top-rated portion of the RBS offering priced to
yield 0.9 percentage points more than the benchmark swap rate as
tighter underwriting standards give investors more confidence in
the mortgages being bundled into securities being sold now
compared with those written in 2007.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was attacked
by the state-controlled China Youth Daily as a &#8220;black hand&#8221;
that plays &#8220;tricks carefully designed to gamble with Chinese
enterprises,&#8221; the Financial Times reported. 
The Chinese newspaper&#8217;s article, which alleged that Goldman
may have &#8220;created even bigger losses for Chinese companies and
investors than it did with its fraudulent actions in the U.S.,&#8221;
was distributed through the Xinhua News and People&#8217;s Daily
websites, the FT said. 
China Youth Daily said Goldman has made an excessive amount
of money from underwriting initial public offerings, arranging
transactions and making its own private-equity investments,
according to the FT. 
The U.S. investment bank was also criticized for devising
and selling oil-hedging contracts to Chinese state companies,
which consequently suffered losses when oil prices fell, the FT
added.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, plans to sell $1.15 billion of convertible
senior notes due in 2013 and will use the proceeds to repay
short-term debt. 
Microsoft may grant underwriters an option to buy an
additional $100 million of the notes, the Redmond, Washington-
based company said today in a statement. The debt received
ratings of Aaa from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and AAA from
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
The proceeds will let Microsoft retire some of its
commercial paper. As of March 31, it had $2.25 billion of short-
term debt outstanding, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes give Microsoft
more stability with debt at a fixed rate, compared with the more
volatile interest of short-term paper. Convertible notes allow
investors to exchange debt into common stock at a pre-
established rate under specified conditions. 
&#8220;The commercial paper market in the last few years has
done some backflips no one would have expected, at times
freezing or seizing up entirely,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who
oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares, as
chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. 
Microsoft&#8217;s action indicates the company believes the
convertible market is an attractive place to sell now. &#8220;If I
owned some convertibles now, I&#8217;d be looking to sell them,&#8221; he
said. 
Microsoft issued $3.75 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year debt
in May 2009 as it tapped the corporate bond market for the first
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The company&#8217;s $2 billion of 2.95 percent notes maturing in
2014 traded at 103.936 cents on the dollar to yield 1.916
percent at 11:01 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. 
Microsoft fell 18 cents to $25.11 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia&#8217;s
largest mobile-phone company, swung to profit in the first
quarter as the country&#8217;s economy rebounded from its steepest
decline on record. 
Net income was $381 million, compared with net loss of
$53.5 million in the same period last year, MTS said in a
statement today. Sales gained 23 percent to $2.61 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Shamolin said the increase
was led by new customers and services, including in data
transmission. MTS&#8217;s &#8220;strong competing position&#8221; is allowing
the company to &#8220;take advantage of the economic growth.&#8221; 
Russia&#8217;s economy rebounded in the first quarter, growing
2.9 percent after shrinking 7.9 percent in 2009, the biggest
annual contraction on record. The ruble was 15 percent higher
against the dollar at the end of the period than it was a year
earlier, making it cheaper for companies with revenue in the
Russian currency to repay debt denominated in the greenback. 
MTS, based in Moscow, said operating income before
depreciation and amortization, or Oibda, advanced 20 percent,
less than sales, to $1.15 billion. Oibda margin, a measure of
profitability, narrowed to 44.1 percent from 45.1 percent.

Australian hedge fund Basis Capital
sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for $1 billion in a Manhattan
court, claiming it was forced into insolvency after buying
mortgage-linked securities that the New York-based firm created
and one of its executives termed &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
The lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund was
filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
sale of the &#8220;now notorious Timberwolf collateralized debt
obligation,&#8221; Basis said in a statement. 
&#8220;Goldman was pressuring investors to take the risk of
toxic securities off its books with knowingly false sales
pitches,&#8221; Eric Lewis, the lawyer for Basis Capital, said in the
statement. &#8220;Goldman should be called to account.&#8221; 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16, alleging fraud tied to a CDO known as Abacus
2007-AC1. Later that month, U.S. Senate lawmakers released
internal Goldman Sachs e-mails in which Thomas K. Montag, former
head of sales and trading in the Americas at Goldman Sachs,
called the Timberwolf Ltd. CDO &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
In its securities-fraud complaint, Basis said that this e-
mail was sent in the same week that it was closing its deal with
Goldman Sachs to purchase exposure to Timberwolf through credit
default swaps. The company asked for more than $1 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages. 
&#8216;Misguided Attempt&#8217; 
&#8220;The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; the investment
bank said today in a statement. 
Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, said in
its complaint that Goldman Sachs falsely claimed in June 2007
that the market for securities such as Timberwolf had stabilized
and that the investment was a &#8220;good entry point.&#8221; 
&#8220;All of these representations were knowingly false,&#8221;
Basis said in its statement. 
Within 2 1/2 weeks of its investment in the Timberwolf CDO,
Goldman Sachs began &#8220;to make significant margin calls&#8221; on
Basis and forced the firm into insolvency, Basis said. 
Timberwolf held pieces of other CDOs, according to a
statement from the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations in April. Timberwolf also included optimistic
side-bets on the performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the
firm took the opposite pessimistic side in &#8220;many&#8221; cases, the
panel said. 
Senator&#8217;s Comments 
The CDO was among the securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the New York-based firm needed to reduce
its mortgage holdings, said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan
Democrat. 
Goldman Sachs denied it cheated Basis. 
&#8220;At the time of the Timberwolf transaction, Basis
specifically stated that it would not place any reliance on
Goldman Sachs, and this decision formed part of the agreement
Basis signed,&#8221; the bank said in its statement. 
Basis made its investment at market levels that &#8220;were
substantially below the face value of the securities and
consistent with where other investors were purchasing the same
Timberwolf securities during the same time,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. 
Goldman Sachs lost several hundred millions of dollars of
its money from its exposure to Timberwolf, according to its
statement. 
The Yield Alpha Fund, formerly Basis Capital&#8217;s second
biggest, filed for bankruptcy protection in the Cayman Islands
in August 2007 after banks cut the value of its investments in
collateralized debt obligations, triggering margin calls the
fund was unable to meet. That came a month after investors in
two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds were told there was no value
left, wiping out the $1.6 billion initially invested. 
The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, raised $1.15 billion of interest-free financing
from its first sale of convertible bonds. 
The senior notes, which don&#8217;t pay a coupon and will be
redeemed at face value, can be handed over for shares when
Microsoft stock rises to about $33.40, a 33 percent increase
from June 8, according to a statement. The bonds, which Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft may redeem in cash, stock or both,
can&#8217;t be converted until March 2013 except in &#8220;certain
circumstances,&#8221; and they mature in June that year. 
Microsoft is the only issuer of convertible bonds with a
top rating from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s,
allowing it to benefit from investors seeking to boost the
average credit rankings of their funds. Convertible bonds are
typically sold by companies that are unrated or graded below
BBB-, the lowest investment grade, by SP and Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s. 
&#8220;Really, with the zero coupon this didn&#8217;t look that
attractive to us,&#8221; said Anja Eijking, who manages the
equivalent of about $2 billion in global equity-linked
securities at FC Netherlands BV in Amsterdam and didn&#8217;t order
the bonds. &#8220;You&#8217;d need a strong view on the stock appreciating.
Basically, this is cheap financing for the issuer.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. is shuttering five
ESPN Zone restaurants, saying the economics of the business
became too challenging. 
Locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and
Washington will close June 16, ESPN said today in an e-mailed
statement. The cable sports network is controlled by Burbank,
California-based Disney, 
ESPN Zone is a sports-themed restaurant chain started 12
years ago by Disney. It will stay open in Los Angeles and
Anaheim, California, where the restaurants are run by Anschutz
Entertainment Group and Zone Enterprises, ESPN said. 
&#8220;This was a very difficult decision to make&#8221; Rick
Alessandri, senior vice president at the cable sports network,
said in an interview. &#8220;But it was the right decision to make.&#8221;
It comes as Disney is opening a new retail store in New York&#8217;s
Times Square. 
Each restaurant was split into three sections, according to
Disney regulatory filings: a &#8220;studio grill&#8221; for dining, a
&#8220;screening room&#8221; for watching ESPN sports coverage and a
&#8220;sports arena&#8221; for playing interactive games. 
The restaurants averaged about 30,000 square feet, large by
industry standards, Alessandri said. The 50,000-square-foot
location in Times Square was the biggest, and the restaurant in
Baltimore was the chain&#8217;s first, he said. 
ESPN wouldn&#8217;t release revenue or other financial
information about the chain. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained 22 cents
to $33.37 at 2:12 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, the shares had climbed 2.8 percent this
year.

Morgan Stanley hired Michael V. Johnson, a Deutsche Bank AG investment banker, to advise oil and
gas exploration and production companies, a person briefed on
the plans said. 
Johnson will join as a managing director in the energy
investment-banking group this year, said the person, who spoke
on condition of anonymity because Johnson hasn&#8217;t started yet.
Deutsche Bank spokesman John Gallagher confirmed the departure.
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney said she couldn&#8217;t

Johnson is among at least three senior Deutsche Bank
investment bankers with clients in the energy industry to be
hired by rivals as the Frankfurt-based company leads financial
firms in advising oil and gas mergers this year. James Denaut
and Michael B. Hill are leaving for Tokyo-based Nomura, ranked
22nd, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
Morgan Stanley is ranked eighth. 
Johnson was deputy head of global banking for the Americas
at Deutsche Bank until last year, when he became a senior client
coverage officer in New York. He joined the company in 2001
after stints as chief financial officer for a technology startup
and as a banker at firms including Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette. 
He advised Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy Inc. when
it agreed in April to buy Arena Resources Inc. for $1.6 billion. 
Morgan Stanley is the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest merger adviser
across all industries so far this year, and Deutsche Bank is
ranked fifth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Michael Cohrs, Deutsche Bank&#8217;s co-head of investment
banking alongside Anshu Jain, plans to retire in coming weeks,
people with knowledge of his plans said earlier this month.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to set up
an investment banking joint venture in China with First Capital
Securities Co., paving the way for the U.S. bank to manage
domestic share sales in China. 
Shenzhen-based First Capital and JPMorgan signed the
agreement today following a memorandum of understanding in March,
the New York-based company said in a press release today. The
venture, to be 33 percent owned by JPMorgan, requires regulatory
approval, it said. 
JPMorgan, the world&#8217;s biggest manager of equity sales this
year, aims to close the gap with rivals in China including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG after having lagged behind
in forming ventures. Tying up with a local firm is a
prerequisite for arranging share sales in China, the world&#8217;s
biggest market for initial public offerings in 2009. 
Deutsche Bank AG last year won approval to form a venture
with Shanxi Securities Co. Credit Suisse Group AG cleared the
hurdle in 2008. CSLA Asia-Pacific Markets&#8217;s securities venture
also won approval to offer brokerage services that year, after
operating in the country for about five years. 
First Capital, established a decade ago, offers corporate
finance, fixed income, merger-and-acquisition, securities
brokerage and asset management services. It has branches in 12
Chinese cities, according to the statement. 
Biggest IPO Market 
Companies raised 209 billion yuan ($31 billion) in IPOs in
Shanghai and Shenzhen last year, making China the world&#8217;s
biggest market for first-time stock sales even after the
securities regulator blocked offerings in the first half. 
JPMorgan spent four years in failed talks with Bohai
Securities Co. and Liaoning Securities Co., Asia-Pacific Chief
Executive Officer Gaby Abdelnour said in a March 2 interview. 
The bank now has asset management and futures and options
ventures and operates a locally incorporated bank in China. It
must wait five-years to qualify for a brokerage license under
rules set by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. 
First Capital was ranked 33rd among underwriters in China
last year after it arranged 6.76 billion yuan in stock and bond
sales, according to the Securities Association of China. The
ranking made the firm eligible to form a partnership with a
foreign bank, under the nation&#8217;s securities laws.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said he sees no signs of a resolution to the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud claims against the
firm. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s no indications of anything at this point,&#8221; Cohn
told reporters at a conference in Montreal today. 
Cohn&#8217;s comments follow news that the SEC is probing a
second Goldman Sachs collateralized debt obligation in addition
to the Abacus transaction at the center of the SEC&#8217;s suit. Asked
about the new investigation, Cohn, 49, told reporters: &#8220;I read
it in the newspaper this morning, like you did.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock fell as much as 4 percent today to
its lowest in more than a year after a person familiar with the
matter said the SEC is looking into the firm&#8217;s 2006 sale of a
CDO called Hudson Mezzanine. While the inquiries may not lead to
any action, the news came less than a week after the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission subpoenaed New York-based Goldman
Sachs for information and an Australian hedge fund sued the
firm. 
The shares fell $3.03, or 2.2 percent, at $133.77 as of
4:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after
dropping as low as $131.30. The last time the shares closed
below $132 was on May 13, 2009. 
Goldman Sachs has fallen for six straight days, the longest
losing streak since October 2008.

He will join the New York-based company on Sept. 9,
according to an internal memo confirmed by Sandra Hernandez, a
spokeswoman. 
Parker spent more than 10 years at Bernstein, an investment

manager of $466 billion. Most recently he was chief investment
strategist and director of quantitative research, according to

of research and senior semiconductor analyst. 
Stephen Penwell, head of North America equity research,
will oversee Parker, who will make the firm&#8217;s forecasts for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Jason Todd, a global equity

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s $2
billion Hudson Mezzanine collateralized debt obligation, sold in
2006, is the target of a probe by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
The inquiry into the CDO may not lead to any additional
actions against the New York-based securities firm, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the investigation
isn&#8217;t public. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. The
Financial Times reported the probe yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs shares have fallen 26 percent since the SEC
filed a fraud lawsuit against the firm on April 16 that related
to its 2007 sale of a CDO called Abacus. Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat, said in April that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sales of
CDOs such as Hudson raised &#8220;a real ethical issue.&#8221; 
&#8220;The ethical issue is valid, but Goldman isn&#8217;t the only
investment bank&#8221; that sold CDOs, said Ambrose Chang, a Hong
Kong-based fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments HK Ltd. &#8220;After
the financial crisis, all Wall Street banks&#8217; reputations have
been fundamentally damaged.&#8221; 
In the Abacus suit, the SEC said Goldman Sachs and one of
its employees, Fabrice Tourre, didn&#8217;t disclose to investors the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. in devising and betting
against the securities. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing on
the Abacus CDO and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s case. 
Hedge Fund Suit 
CDOs parcel fixed-income assets such as bonds or loans and
slice them into new securities of varying risks, providing
higher returns than other investments of the same rating. 
In a separate case, Goldman Sachs was sued by Australian
hedge fund Basis Capital for $1 billion. In the suit, filed
yesterday in Manhattan federal court, Basis claims it was forced
into insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities that the
firm created and one of its executives termed &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
&#8220;The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
said in a statement. 
The U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
led by Levin, released e-mails in April related to Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s mortgage-linked deals, including the Hudson Mezzanine
transaction. In one October 2006 e-mail, a Goldman Sachs
employee describes how the Hudson deal might be viewed by
investors as &#8220;junk.&#8221; 
Hudson Mezzanine 
The Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1 CDO contained credit default
swaps that referenced $2 billion in subprime, BBB-rated
residential mortgage-backed securities, according to the
documents released by Levin&#8217;s committee. While Goldman Sachs
selected the assets in the deal, the firm was also the only
investor buying credit protection on the entire transaction, the
documents show. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the Hudson CDO in late 2006,
near the time documents released by Levin show senior executives
wanted to reduce the firm&#8217;s exposure to subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;The CDO imploded within two years. Your clients lost;
Goldman profited,&#8221; Levin said in an April 27 hearing during
which he questioned Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein about the Hudson deal and other CDOs. &#8220;To go out and
sell these securities to people and then bet against those same
securities, it seems to me, is a fundamental conflict of
interest and is -- raises a real ethical issue.&#8221; 
Blankfein responded that &#8220;we are one of the largest client
franchises in market-making in these kinds of activities we&#8217;re
talking about&#8221; and that &#8220;they know our activities, and they
understand what market-making is.&#8221; 
While Goldman Sachs was short on the Hudson Mezzanine CDO,
meaning it stood to gain from a collapse because of the credit
protection it had purchased, a marketing document for the deal
released by Levin&#8217;s committee states that &#8220;Goldman Sachs has
aligned incentives with the Hudson program.&#8221; 
In a short sale, an investor bets the value of a security
will decline.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired law

The law firm, founded by David Boies and Jonathan Schiller

executives described internally as a &#8220;shi**y deal.&#8221; 
Boies, Schiller joins a growing list of firms providing
legal and regulatory advice to Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, which was sued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in April over its marketing
of another CDO known as Abacus. 
Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of a U.S. Senate
subcommittee hearing in April from K. Lee Blalack II of
O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s
chief counsel and staff director. 
Skadden Arps 
Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White House
counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher 
Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. 
Last month, Goldman Sachs considered hiring law firm Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its legal
team, before deciding against it, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time. 
In a June 9 statement about the Timberwolf lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs called it &#8220;a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley, once the biggest
property investor among Wall Street banks, raised $4.7 billion
for a new global real estate fund, less than half its target
before the financial crisis. 
Some of the New York-based firm&#8217;s largest institutional
clients didn&#8217;t put money in the new fund after market losses.
The Washington State Investment Board, which placed $880 million
in two prior Morgan Stanley property funds, decided against
committing new capital. 
&#8220;We will not be investing in the new fund because it is
global including U.S. and we already have a large U.S.
concentration,&#8221; Liz Mendizabal, spokeswoman for the Olympia-
based pension board, said in an e-mail today. 
Many investors have shied away from real estate deals amid
falling property values and scarcer debt financing. Morgan
Stanley had hoped to raise $10 billion for the fund, according
to minutes from a June 2008 meeting of the Contra Costa County
Employees&#8217; Retirement Association. Still, the fund is the
largest to close since 2008. 
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII will invest in the U.S.
and internationally, said company spokeswoman Alyson Barnes,
noting that the firm supplied less than 10 percent of the
capital. 
&#8216;Significant&#8217; Opportunities 
The real estate fund will &#8220;take advantage of the
significant investment opportunities this part of the real
estate cycle presents to us,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said in a
statement. 
Wall Street firms may be barred from owning and investing
in hedge funds and private equity under the so-called Volcker
rule, part of the Senate&#8217;s financial reform bill. Lawmakers from
the House and Senate are merging bills passed by the two
chambers into a single measure for President Barack Obama&#8217;s
signature. 
Morgan Stanley, which managed $46.4 billion of real estate
assets for clients as of March 31, suffered losses in its last
fund. The firm told investors this year that it expects to lose
$5.4 billion of an $8.8 billion real estate fund from 2007, a
person familiar with the situation said in April. 
Concord, California-based Contra Costa County Employees&#8217;
Retirement Association rescinded its decision to invest $75
million in the new fund in February 2009, citing market risk and
staff departures at Morgan Stanley. New Jersey&#8217;s pension fund
also decided not to pursue a $150 million potential investment. 
John Klopp 
To bolster its real estate effort, Morgan Stanley named
John Klopp as head of investing in Americas real estate and
global property debt in February, and its Alternative Investment
Partners fund of funds business raised $370 million for a fund
focused on private-equity real estate funds. 
Morgan Stanley recorded about $4.4 billion in real estate
losses in 2008 and 2009. In April, the firm booked a $932
million loss on its investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC,
the developer of an unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City,
New Jersey. In November, Morgan Stanley agreed to hand over
Crescent Real Estate Equities to Barclays Capital, ending its
obligation on a $2 billion loan. 
The firm sent a fourth-quarter update to clients of its
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VI International showing it was
likely to recover $3.4 billion of its investments, the person
said in April. The California State Teachers&#8217; Retirement
System&#8217;s $440 million investment in the fund has declined 86
percent as of Sept. 30, 2009, according to figures provided by
spokeswoman Sherry Reser.

Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are expected to lead General Motors Co.&#8217;s initial public
offering that may have the U.S. reducing its ownership as soon
as this year, people familiar with the matter said. 
At least five investment banks competed to handle the sale,
which may be worth as much as $12 billion, making it the second-
largest in a decade. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, both based in
New York, would be responsible for writing the prospectus and
promoting the shares to potential investors, said two people who
asked not to be identified because the decision isn&#8217;t final. 
Returning GM to public ownership will allow the U.S. to
reduce its 61 percent stake and harvest returns on its $50
billion investment in the nation&#8217;s largest automaker. Choosing a
lead bank in June means Detroit-based GM may hold an offering in
the fourth quarter, people familiar with the matter have said. 
&#8220;The government wants out as quickly as possible, but they
also want to tell the public it&#8217;s a good deal,&#8221; David Cole,
chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, said in an interview. &#8220;They will want to be out before
the presidential election in 2012.&#8221; 
Mark Paustenbach, a spokesman for the Treasury, declined to
comment, citing a department statement yesterday that said
federal securities laws preclude it from discussing the identity
of potential underwriters before a registration statement is
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A GM
spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem, also declined to comment. 
Automotive Lending 
GM Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre wants the company to
have an automotive-lending unit before going public, people
familiar with the plan have said. GM hasn&#8217;t had such a
subsidiary since former CEO Rick Wagoner sold 51 percent of GMAC
to private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP in 2006. 
Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said May 17 the
automaker&#8217;s first-quarter net profit of $865 million was a
&#8220;good, useful step&#8221; toward an initial offering. He said that
the stock sale may not come until 2011 and that it wouldn&#8217;t be
necessary to control a financing unit before going public. 
The banks&#8217; expected selection was reported earlier by the
Wall Street Journal. 
GM&#8217;s choice will be &#8220;subject to Treasury&#8217;s agreement that
the selection is reasonable,&#8221; the government said yesterday in a
statement. The Treasury and GM are expected to sell shares, and
other holders may participate, the government said. 
IPO Timing 
The timing of the offering will depend on GM&#8217;s
profitability, the health of the economy and the state of
capital markets, said three people familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;It will happen when the markets are ready and when the
company is ready,&#8221; Liddell said May 17 on a conference call. 
The sale may raise as much as $12 billion, an estimate by
Independent International Investment Research Plc showed. 
GM&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s bond prices, GM&#8217;s
implied equity value is about $47 billion. 
Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group&#8217;s $10.6
billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.&#8217;s $8.68 billion deal
in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.&#8217;s $5.47 billion sale in
1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The size of the sale hasn&#8217;t been determined yet, said one
person familiar with the plan. 
Bankruptcy Emergence 
GM emerged from bankruptcy in July with its ownership split
between the old bondholders, the U.S., Canada and a trust to
cover health care for union retirees. 
The U.S. government&#8217;s current net investment in the
automaker is $42.2 billion, according to a senior official in
President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration. GM has repaid $6.7
billion in loans and paid $600 million in interest and
dividends. The U.S. also holds $2.1 billion in the company&#8217;s
preferred shares. 
&#8220;When we did this restructuring we never expected a full
recovery of our investment,&#8221; Steven Rattner, the former head of
Obama&#8217;s automotive task force, said May 10 in Detroit. &#8220;If it
ends up costing us $10 billion, we should consider it a
success.&#8221; 
For the Treasury to break even, the value of GM would need
to rise to about $80 billion after bondholders and the UAW&#8217;s
health-care trust exercise stock warrants that dilute the U.S.
ownership. 
Lazard Advice 
The Treasury has hired Lazard Ltd. for $500,000 a month to
advise on selling its stake, according to a document on the
department&#8217;s website. Evercore Partners Inc. also is advising GM
on the selection, a person familiar with the matter said. 
GM and Treasury officials met with senior executives from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley last month in Washington about
hiring a lead bank, said one person familiar with the matter. 
The Treasury said yesterday that it will determine the
underwriters&#8217; fees, which finance professors at Cornell
University and Georgetown estimate may be as low as 2 percent.
That would be less than any U.S. IPO over $5 billion since 1999,
Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;General Motors is a government entity now, and the banks
that may underwrite the deal were government entities or got
help from the government,&#8221; said William Smith, president of New
York-based Smith Asset Management, which used to own shares of
GM. &#8220;I imagine with the IPO they&#8217;ll do the politically correct
thing and keep fees down.&#8221; 
Choosing a lead underwriter now allows GM to file an S-1
initial registration form as soon as July and sell shares in
October or November, a person familiar with the matter said. 
GM management has been preparing for an IPO so they will be
ready whenever the timing is right, said a GM executive who
asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. 
Whitacre was installed as chairman by Obama&#8217;s task force
when it replaced more than half of the directors in July.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $716.3
million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages in the second
offering of the debt this year, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. 
The largest top-rated portion, maturing in 4.53 years,
yields 140 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren&#8217;t public. The AAA rated slice maturing in about 9.53 years
yields 165 basis points over the benchmark, the person said. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 
Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. 
Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7 million of the
bonds in April, the first issue to pool loans from multiple
borrowers since June 2008. 
Top-rated securities tied to commercial property loans
yield about 3.04 percentage points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, compared with 2.19 percentage points over Treasuries
on April 16, then a 22-month low, according to Barclays Plc
data. Spreads have widened on concern that the European
sovereign debt crisis may slow global economic growth.

Losses in the biggest U.S. banks and
brokerages, whose share prices are more linked to the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index than at any time in seven years, suggest the
benchmark measure of American equities may extend its seven-week
slump, according to Concept Capital&#8217;s John Kolovos. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reached $192.28 on Oct. 14, the
highest level since May 2008, and $184.46 on April 14 before
closing at $133.77 yesterday -- forming a rounding-top pattern
also seen in JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley --
suggesting the SP 500 faces losses, he said. The measure has
retreated 11 percent since April 23. 
&#8220;As long as these guys continue to move lower, mom and pop
or any big institutions will not be inclined to head into
equities,&#8221; said Kolovos, co-head of technical analysis research
for the New York-based firm. &#8220;We&#8217;re using these stocks as a
barometer.&#8221; 
A slowdown in an equity rally that eventually turns into
losses is called a rounding top by technical analysts, who base
forecasts on historical price fluctuations. Chart watchers, such
as Kolovos, say the pattern indicates stocks face more declines
in the future. 
Financial companies in the SP 500 are moving in line with
the U.S. equity benchmark. Using 30 days of trading data, the
correlation coefficient between the industry and the broader
stock index rose to 0.9724 yesterday, meaning price fluctuations
are the most similar since April 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Readings of 1 show the measures are
rising or falling in lockstep. 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings for 2009, has
fallen 21 percent to $133.77 this year after U.S. regulators
sued the company for fraud related to mortgage securities.
Morgan Stanley is down 14 percent to $25.59, while JPMorgan lost
8.1 percent to $38.29 in 2010. All three banks are based in New
York. The SP 500 has slipped 2.5 percent.

chief executive officer of the firm&#8217;s South Korea unit, has been

Note to Lloyd Blankfein: Imagine,
for a moment, what would happen if a cardiac surgeon were paid
like a Wall Street banker in 2006. 
For each operation, the doctor would earn more, regardless
of the risk to the patient, writes Suzanne McGee in &#8220;Chasing
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; The greater the risk, in fact, the higher the
fee. Should half his patients die the next year, the hospital
might dismiss the surgeon -- with a golden handshake. He could
then take up a post elsewhere or set up his own practice. 
&#8220;Wall Street doesn&#8217;t have to purchase malpractice
insurance,&#8221; says McGee in this disturbing account of how the
big boys ran amok and began blowing up the money grid. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t even a sense that there is a duty of care to the &#8216;patient&#8217;
-- whether that patient is the client or the financial system.&#8221; 
McGee, a contributing editor at Barron&#8217;s, isn&#8217;t out to bury Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or Blankfein, its chief executive
officer. Her goal is, rather, to show how Wall Street bankers
became preoccupied with their own short-term interests and
drifted away from their raison d&#8217;etre -- to funnel capital from
investors to companies that need it. 
They were, by this account, almost predestined to do so
from the moment the Securities and Exchange Commission banned
fixed trading commissions in the stock market on May 1, 1975.
The prohibition turned their comfy business model upside-down:
&#8220;Mayday,&#8221; they called it, hinting at their distress level.

Chevron Corp. is investigating the
cause and size of an oil pipeline leak in the foothills of Salt
Lake City after shutting the line. 
&#8220;Neither the source of the leak or the quantity of oil
released has been determined at this time,&#8221; said Chevron
spokesman Sean Comey in an e-mail statement. The company was
notified of the leak at around 8:20 p.m. U.S. central time
yesterday, and workers were dispatched to shut the line and
start containment of the spill, he said. 
Initial estimates said around 500 barrels seeped from the
10-inch line that has a capacity of about 15,000 barrels a day,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for Mayor Ralph Becker, citing Chevron data. 
Chevron told Smith they shut the line yesterday and were
estimating a leak of about 50 gallons a minute before it was
turned off, she said. 
Crews placed booms in waterways, including the Jordan
River, &#8220;to minimize downstream impact,&#8221; the mayor&#8217;s office
said in a release yesterday. 
A boom was also laced in a drainage creek, said Comey.
&#8220;Wildlife rehabilitation experts have been engaged&#8221; and some
birds have been washed at the Salt Lake City zoo, he said. 
The pipeline was carrying crude oil from Colorado into the
Salt Lake Valley to its refinery, Smith said. Chevron&#8217;s Salt
Lake City plant can process 45,000 barrels a day of crude,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;They haven&#8217;t given a firm timeline on when they&#8217;ll
restart the line,&#8221; Smith said.

Chevron Corp. should face a new
trial for allegedly sanctioning beatings and shootings of
Nigerian protesters in 1998 because jurors who cleared the
company in 2008 were given erroneous instructions, lawyers for
protesters argued to a U.S. appeals court today. 
A federal court jury was told, incorrectly, that the
protesters had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that company-
paid soldiers used excessive force against those who boarded
Chevron&#8217;s oil drilling platform located nine miles offshore of
the Niger Delta, said Theresa Traber, an attorney for the
Nigerians and their families. 
Instead, it was Chevron&#8217;s burden to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the peaceful protesters, who were unarmed
and running away with arms raised when shots were fired, had
committed crimes that justified the type of force used by the
soldiers, Traber told the three-judge appellate panel at today&#8217;s
hearing in San Francisco. The Nigerians were protesting over
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area. 
&#8220;This was a major error that deprived the plaintiffs of
the fair trial they should have had on their battery claims,&#8221;
Traber said. 
Two men were killed, others were shot and beaten and one
man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a protest about
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area, according to
a 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. Nineteen Nigerians sued the
company claiming it was liable for the actions of the Nigerian
soldiers it hired to provide security for the oil platform. 
150 Workers 
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said at trial
that villagers invaded the platform and held 150 workers hostage
for ransom. They had knives, prevented workers from leaving the
platform and threatened to set it on fire, the jury was told.
The company said the soldiers acted in self-defense and denied
directing their conduct. 
Craig Stewart, an attorney at Jones Day representing
Chevron today, told the judges that the jury was given proper
instructions by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who presided
over the trial. Both sides had agreed that Nigerian law would be
applied to the battery claims by protesters, he said. 
&#8220;Nigerian law, like California law, like federal law, puts
the burden on plaintiffs to prove that the force was
excessive,&#8221; Stewart said. 
Jury Cleared Chevron 
After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. 
Lawyers for the protesters appealed the verdict to the
federal appeals court in San Francisco. The judges took the
matter under submission and didn&#8217;t say when they would issue a
decision. A ruling in favor of the protesters could lead to a
retrial on battery claims of three Nigerians injured and the
family of a man who was killed in the attacks. 
&#8220;We respect the rulings made by Judge Illston leading up
to and during the 5-week trial and believe that no errors were
made,&#8221; said Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron spokesman, in an e-mail. 
The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).

Microsoft Corp., looking to boost
profit and sales in its Xbox video-game unit, plans to start
selling a motion-controlled device called Kinect on Nov. 4 that
lets console users direct action by moving their bodies. 
The device, demonstrated with several game titles in a
University of Southern California basketball arena yesterday,
will also support video chat. The company also unveiled an
exclusive deal with Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ESPN to put live sports
events on the Xbox Live online game service, Microsoft said at a
Los Angeles press conference today. 
Microsoft, the No. 2 console seller behind Nintendo Co., is
looking to reinvigorate demand as the industry copes with an 11
percent sales decline this year in the U.S., according to data
from NPD Group Inc. Kinect may add $1.6 billion to revenue in
the fiscal year starting July 1 and $2 billion in the year after
that, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;It is unlike anything you have ever experienced before,&#8221;
Microsoft Senior Vice President Don Mattrick, who oversees the
Xbox group, said at the press conference. The system &#8220;brings
your living room to life.&#8221; 
Kinect, previously known as Project Natal, also will let
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft extend the life of its Xbox
360 console, Sarah Friar, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said in a
note. Since new machines typically lose money for the first few
years, a longer shelf life should help Microsoft improve profit
in a division that has lost $8.6 billion since 1999, according
to estimates from Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies 
Co. in San Francisco. 
Playing Catch-Up 
Microsoft&#8217;s first motion-sensing games come four years
after Nintendo started selling the Wii motion-activated system,
which helped the Kyoto-based company take the lead in console
sales. Sony Corp., maker of the PlayStation 3 console, will
demonstrate its Move motion-controller this week. 
While Kinect is geared toward family play, Microsoft also
showed off titles for traditional gamers. Activision Blizzard
Inc. played clips of its battle franchise &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; to be
released later this year, and Microsoft and the Epic Games Inc.
previewed their new &#8220;Gears of War&#8221; title. 
Microsoft will make 3,500 live sporting events from ESPN
available to customers who buy its Xbox Live gold membership.
The programming will include college football and basketball,
Major League Baseball and soccer. 
Microsoft said it now has 25 million members for Xbox Live.
The company has previously said that about half of Xbox Live
members pay for the service. 
The company also will start shipping a new Xbox machine
today. The product has a sleeker design, built-in Wi-Fi and is
less noisy than the earlier model. The machine will cost
$299.99, the same as the old model. 
Nintendo sold 277,200 Wii consoles in the U.S. in April,
compared with shipments of 185,400 Xbox 360s and 180,800
PlayStation 3s, according to NPD. 
Microsoft fell 17 cents to $25.50 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and
ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil companies, will ask
lawmakers not to punish them for the human and environmental
damage inflicted by BP Plc&#8217;s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, Chevron CEO
John Watson and James Mulva, CEO of ConocoPhillips, are
scheduled to appear tomorrow before a House Energy and Commerce
Committee panel examining offshore drilling safety and U.S.
energy policy. 
The hearing presents the U.S. oil CEOs with an opportunity
to distance their companies from BP, said Anthony Sabino, who
teaches oil and natural-gas law at St. John&#8217;s University in New
York. BP has lost 43 percent of its market value since the
disaster and has been excoriated by President Barack Obama for
repeated failures to cap the leaking well. 
&#8220;A crucifixion of the whole oil industry for the sins of
BP in the form of a ban on deep-water drilling isn&#8217;t a good idea
because look at all the people it&#8217;s going to put out of work,&#8221;
Sabino said. &#8220;Exxon and ConocoPhillips will stress their own
safety records to make that case.&#8221; 
Since an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 workers, more than 50 million
gallons of crude have poured into the Gulf from a BP-owned well,
based on calculations from a government panel. 
Obama Meeting 
The U.S. government has intensified pressure on BP to stop
the spill and pay for damages. Obama has asked to meet June 16
with BP&#8217;s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, and other company
officials. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward will appear
before the House Energy and Commerce oversight committee the
following day. 
The oil company CEOs have been asked to testify tomorrow
about the spill&#8217;s effect on U.S. energy policy, Eben Burnham-
Snyder, a spokesman for Representative Edward Markey, said June
9. Markey is a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the
subcommittee holding the hearing. 
The executives may also be pressed to explain dividend
payouts and share buyback programs that have dwarfed their
investments in alternatives to petroleum, such as solar and
wind, according to a June 12 memorandum written by Congressional
staff and distributed to lawmakers who will participate in
tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. 
Executive Pleas 
Tillerson, Watson and Mulva probably will ask lawmakers to
avoid changes in offshore drilling rules that could discourage
exploration in U.S. territorial waters without making meaningful
contributions to safety, said Gianna Bern, president of
Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois,
which advises oil companies on strategy and risk management. 
Tillerson will tell lawmakers that an investigation needs
to determine if BP took risks &#8220;beyond industry norms,&#8221;
according to prepared remarks he&#8217;s scheduled to deliver during
tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. Proper well design, redundant safety systems
and regular maintenance and tests help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level for oil and natural
gas, he said. 
Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, said he couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. Nancy Turner,
a spokeswoman for Houston-based ConocoPhillips, said in an e-
mail that the company wouldn&#8217;t release Mulva&#8217;s prepared remarks. 
More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to cease
drilling off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas for at least six
months while federal officials conduct a review of offshore
safety practices. The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil
production, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
Drilling Pause 
The drilling halt may cut oil production in the Gulf by as
much as 11 percent next year, said Paul Cheng, a Barclays
Capital analyst. 
&#8220;These executives need to explain to the politicians that
if you permanently shut us down in the deep water it&#8217;s going to
wreak havoc with energy production and put the United States
even more at the mercy of foreign oil producers,&#8221; Sabino said. 
Also scheduled to appear before tomorrow&#8217;s panel are Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the presidents of the U.S. units of BP
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, respectively. 
Lawmakers may ask Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell
to describe safety measures they have used offshore to avoid the
sort of disaster BP faced, said Bern, a former BP crude trader. 
Exxon, which pumps more crude than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, abandoned an exploration
project known as Blackbeard in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 rather
than risk a blowout. The company quit the project, which sought
to drill more than six miles (9.7 kilometers) beneath the
seafloor, after repeated pressure surges indicated the well was
unstable. 
Controlling Macondo 
BP engineers alerted federal regulators at the Minerals
Management Service that they were having difficulty controlling
the Macondo well six weeks before the disaster, according to e-
mails released by the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this would have happened on Exxon&#8217;s
watch,&#8221; Tom Bower, author of &#8220;The Squeeze: Oil, Money and
Greed in the 21st Century,&#8221; said in a June 11 Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;They&#8217;d be much more careful and much
more conscious of the need to supervise subcontractors.&#8221;

Teun Draaisma, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s top-

Following Draaisma&#8217;s departure, Graham Secker will head the

best European equity strategist in the 2009 Thomson Extel
survey. 
In December, Draaisma was the only strategist among 16
surveyed by Bloomberg to forecast a retreat in European stocks
by the end of 2010. He raised his recommendation on the region&#8217;s
equities to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;underweight&#8221; on May 10 to
&#8220;take advantage of the recent weakness.&#8221; The benchmark Stoxx

Draaisma was joint head of European strategy with Ben Funnell from 2003 until 2006, when Funnell moved to hedge fund
GLG Partners Inc. A call to TT International was referred to the

Electricite de France SA, Europe&#8217;s
biggest power generator, and other French utilities are ready to
start publishing forecasts for individual power-plant
availability by the end of the month. 
The production outlook for the short- and medium-term for
power stations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts will
be disclosed by the end of June, said Soizic Hemion, deputy head
of the Union Francaise de l&#8217;Electricite, the trade organization
for power producers that includes EDF and GDF Suez SA. 
Utilities are testing publication through the existing
power data website of the Reseau de Transport d&#8217; Electricite,
she said. RTE is wholly owned by EDF. 
At the end of 2010, information on unplanned outages at
power stations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts will
be disclosed within 30 minutes, Hemion said. 
The two-stage plan to expand publicly available information
on power plants in France was announced by the trade group last
November following criticism of EDF by France&#8217;s energy regulator
for posting &#8220;insufficient&#8221; forecasts about power production. 
Generation data is important because prices hinge on how
much power is being produced at any given time. Electricity,
unlike other commodities, can&#8217;t be stored, so unexpected supply
cuts in one country may mean soaring prices in another part of
Europe&#8217;s interconnected markets. 
EDF now provides information about halts and restarts at
its 58 nuclear reactors, which provide more than three quarters
of the country&#8217;s power, on recorded messages on answering
machines at 19 plants. These are often updated weekly. The
utility has long resisted publishing real-time information on
the grounds that it is &#8220;commercially sensitive.&#8221;

Tesla Motors Inc., the maker of
electric sports cars that hasn&#8217;t posted a profit since its
founding in 2003, said it will seek to raise $178 million
selling a 12 percent stake in its initial public offering. 
The producer of the $109,000 electric Roadster will offer
11.1 million shares at $14 to $16 each on June 29 and use the
proceeds to pay for factories and possible acquisitions, a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing and data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Tesla filed in January to raise as much as
$100 million without disclosing how many shares it intended to
sell or the price range. 
The automaker is pushing forward with its sale even after
the European debt crisis spurred at least 34 companies to
postpone or withdraw IPOs since the start of May. Tesla, which
has sold about 1,000 Roadsters while losing $290 million, is
using the share sale and a $465 million loan from the government
to help produce its second electric car, the Model S sedan. 
&#8220;Bringing a completely new type of vehicle to market can
cost $1 billion, and Tesla may be looking at that level of
expense,&#8221; said Eric Noble, president of The CarLab, an
automotive consulting company in Orange, California. &#8220;The
danger for the early investor is that if Tesla can&#8217;t find the
next section of funding, it&#8217;s a bridge to nowhere.&#8221; 
Tesla hired New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co., along with Deutsche Bank AG in
Frankfurt, to lead the sale. 
CEO Musk 
Existing stockholders including Chief Executive Officer
Elon Musk will sell 1.1 million shares. He spent more than $70
million of his own money on Tesla before May 2009, when
Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler AG invested $50 million. 
Musk, who co-founded PayPal Inc., the online payment
company now owned by San Jose, California-based EBay Inc., is
also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Inc., a
Hawthorne, California-based company that builds spacecraft. 
Tesla has delivered more than 1,000 of its electric
Roadster sports cars since 2008 and intends to fill orders for
an additional 1,200. The Model S sedan is going into production
in 2012 in a former Toyota Motor Corp.-General Motors Co. joint
venture factory in Fremont, California, which the company is
buying for $42 million. 
Tesla won loans from the U.S. Energy Department in 2009
worth as much as $465 million to get the Model S into production
and expand output of battery packs the company assembles. 
Divorce Proceedings 
Under terms of the federal loan, Musk and certain
affiliates must retain 65 percent of their capital stock in
Tesla for a year after completing the Model S project. Musk&#8217;s
divorce proceedings won&#8217;t result in him owning less than 65
percent or have a material impact on his ability to serve as
CEO, according to filings. 
Toyota agreed last month to purchase $50 million in Tesla
shares. Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota and Tesla say they may
cooperate on electric-vehicle development, though they haven&#8217;t
signed agreements to do so, filings show. 
&#8220;The Toyota connection may help,&#8221; said John Wolkonowicz,
an auto analyst at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts. &#8220;It depends on how involved Toyota becomes.&#8221; 
Tesla is also backed by investors including Mountain View,
California-based Google Inc.&#8217;s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the government of Abu Dhabi, and Daimler, the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of luxury vehicles. 
Relative Value 
At its midpoint price of $15, Tesla is valued at 6 times
net tangible book value, a measure of shareholder equity that
excludes assets that can&#8217;t be sold in liquidation. That&#8217;s about
five times higher than the median ratio of 1.21 for 45
automotive companies globally, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
&#8220;The last America auto company started from whole cloth
that had any record of success was Hudson Motors in 1909,&#8221;
Wolkonowicz said. &#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ve found a formula that works,
but history would argue against them.&#8221; 
GM of Detroit has also said that it may sell shares to the
public this year, while Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Zipcar
Inc., the car-sharing company that rents vehicles by the hour,
filed this month to raise as much as $75 million in an IPO.

The top six U.S. credit-card
lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and
Capital One Financial Corp., said overdue loans fell in May as
consumers avoided taking on new debt amid the economic recovery. 
Loans at least 30 days late, a signal of future write-
offs, dropped to 4.22 percent in May compared with 4.4 percent
in the previous month and the lowest since last July, New York-
based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. Write-offs of
loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging indicator, fell except at
Bank of America and Discover Financial Services. 
The decline in overdue loans signals that the credit-card
industry continues to recover from a record $89 billion of
write-offs last year, when the U.S. unemployment rate topped 10
percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the U.S. economy, may remain muted as people focus on
&#8220;deleveraging,&#8221; according to Capital One Chief Executive
Officer Richard Fairbank. 
&#8220;What they&#8217;re really doing is choosing not necessarily to
go load up on some credit cards, but more to pay down debt,&#8221;
Fairbank said at an investor conference earlier this month.
&#8220;This deleveraging phenomenon hasn&#8217;t provided strength to the
economy.&#8221; 
American Express Co., the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, said overdue loans fell to 2.9 percent last month
from 3.1 percent in April. Late payments dropped to 4.8 percent
from 5.07 percent at McLean, Virginia-based Capital One; 6.39
percent from 6.73 percent at Bank of America; 5.59 percent from
5.85 percent at New York-based Citigroup Inc., and 4.95 percent
from 5.2 percent at Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois. 
Write-offs declined to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent at New
York-based AmEx, the lowest for the group. They rose to 13.33
percent from 12.71 percent at Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, which posted the highest level of
losses. Discover increased to 8.82 percent from 8.42 percent.

Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are as ill-prepared as
BP Plc to halt and clean up an offshore oil spill because they
all use &#8220;carbon copy&#8221; disaster plans, lawmakers said. 
Eight weeks after a drilling rig leased by BP exploded in
the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst
spill in U.S. history, executives from the companies sought at a
House Energy Committee hearing to distance themselves from BP&#8217;s
practices that lawmakers said put profits before safety. 
Lawmakers faulted the four executives for disaster-response
plans that would halt oil leaks at the sea floor using the same
techniques that failed for BP at its Macondo well. The same firm
wrote the plans and included references to making sure crude
doesn&#8217;t injure walruses, which don&#8217;t live in the Gulf of Mexico. 
&#8220;The oil company response plans are great for public
relations but these plans are virtually worthless in the event
of a spill,&#8221; said Representative Bart T. Stupak, a Michigan
Democrat. &#8220;It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the
bunch, but unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of
company.&#8221; 
Energy companies, rig operators and lawmakers in oil-
producing states have urged the Obama administration to lift or
shorten a six-month moratorium on deepwater exploration that has
idled more than two dozen drilling vessels and threatens
thousands of jobs. Lawmakers said today they&#8217;re not convinced
the industry takes safety seriously. 
&#8216;Magic Button&#8217; 
&#8220;You can&#8217;t have a contingency plan that says cross your
fingers and hope the blowout preventer works,&#8221; said
Representative Joe Barton of Texas, the committee&#8217;s senior
Republican. &#8220;They pushed the magic button on the BP rig and it
didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; 
Exxon wouldn&#8217;t have used the well design, cement mixture or
testing procedures BP employed at the Macondo well, CEO Rex Tillerson told lawmakers today. The BP project faced &#8220;a lot of
indications of problems&#8221; in the weeks before the explosion,
Tillerson said. Shell&#8217;s U.S. president, Marvin Odum, and Chevron
CEO John Watson said they wouldn&#8217;t have drilled the well in the
same manner as BP. 
&#8220;Our internal review confirmed what our regular audits
have told us,&#8221; Watson told the committee. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s drilling
and control practices for deepwater wells are safe and
environmentally sound.&#8221; 
&#8216;Deliberate Deception&#8217; 
The CEOs testified a day after the committee released
internal BP documents that lawmakers said showed the company put
cost concerns ahead of safety in the days leading up to April
20. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward is to appear before
a subcommittee June 17, his first congressional testimony since
the well exploded. 
In a preview of questions Hayward may face, Markey asked
Lamar McKay, president of BP America Inc., today why BP&#8217;s
initial estimates of the spill&#8217;s flow rate turned out to be
several times less than the actual leak. The initial estimates
reflected either a &#8220;deliberate deception or gross
incompetence,&#8221; Markey said. 
&#8220;We are sorry for everything the Gulf coast is going
through,&#8221; McKay said. 
BP, the biggest Gulf of Mexico oil producer, made five
&#8220;questionable decisions&#8221; aimed at cutting costs and speeding
completion of an overdue project before the disaster, Democratic
Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Stupak wrote in a
letter to Hayward released yesterday. 
Walruses in Plans 
Markey pressed the CEOs on why their safety plans for a
Gulf spill described the effects on walruses. Two of the
companies also incorporated contact information for a Florida
marine researcher who died in 2005, Markey said. 
&#8220;The plan needs to be updated more frequently,&#8221;
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva said. &#8220;Obviously, it is
embarrassing.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that walruses were included, and it&#8217;s an
embarrassment,&#8221; Tillerson said. 
President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation tonight
on the spill, and the administration is demanding that BP set up
an escrow account for damage claims. BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has been called to the White House tomorrow. 
Industry groups oppose the six-month ban, which Obama put
in place to give a presidential commission time to probe the
spill. Pressed by Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu,
who said her state could lose 330,000 jobs from the moratorium,
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last week said the ban may be
shortened. 
Lost Jobs, Wages 
&#8220;We acknowledge the reasons for the president&#8217;s decision
to pause deepwater drilling,&#8221; Shell&#8217;s Odum said in his prepared
remarks. &#8220;But it is not without consequence: thousands of lost
jobs, and billions in lost wages and spending. And not only on
the Gulf Coast, but also in places like Alaska.&#8221; 
Seventeen House members from Gulf coast states including
Barton and Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, today
called on Obama to end the drilling ban. The group will meet
Salazar tomorrow to discuss the impact of the moratorium. 
&#8220;Many offshore drilling companies and suppliers will not be
able to survive this six-month period and will either go out of
business or move their employees and assets abroad,&#8221; the group
said in a statement. An extended suspension may cost more than
20,000 jobs in Gulf region, according to a statement. 
Exxon&#8217;s Rigs Moving 
Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf,
Tillerson said. The company will send deepwater drilling rigs to
other parts of the world during the administration&#8217;s moratorium,
he said. 
&#8220;We will redirect our human resources, the technical
talent, to other parts of the world where we&#8217;re allowed to work,
and we will redirect the equipment elsewhere,&#8221; Tillerson said.
&#8220;This stuff is too expensive to let them sit around.&#8221; 
When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deepwater drilling to resume, there may be few rigs available
for the work, said Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory
 Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil
companies on strategy and risk management. 
Drilling vessels are steaming out of the Gulf for
assignments in the South China Sea and off the Indonesia coast,
said Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won&#8217;t be able
to return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. 
&#8220;The moratorium will likely draw drilling rigs away from
the Gulf of Mexico to overseas basins, further delaying
development and negatively affecting crucial U.S. jobs that
support these operations,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;Any extension of the
moratorium will only exacerbate the economic consequences.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. Chairman
Stephen Roach said governments and central banks may be sowing
the seeds of a future crisis by keeping overly accommodative
monetary and fiscal policy stances for too long. 
&#8220;Policy makers are making a mistake by pretty much&#8221;
maintaining policies &#8220;in stimulative positions for too long,&#8221;
Roach said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from Hong
Kong. &#8220;It ends up setting the stage for the next crisis.&#8221; 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 10
that the U.S. recovery isn&#8217;t as strong as he would like and that
the impact of Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis must be considered,
suggesting the central bank remains attached to its pledge to
keep interest rates at a record low for an &#8220;extended period.&#8221; 
President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration is forecasting a
record annual budget deficit of $1.6 trillion. The shortfall is
projected to be $10 trillion over the next 10 years, with
interest payments on debt forecast by the Congressional Budget
Office to quadruple to more than $900 billion annually. 
&#8220;Excess sovereign debt is a problem that is endemic in the
developed world,&#8221; Roach said. &#8220;At this point in time, we still
have ample slack in the global economy and an absence of
inflation pressures, but with central banks likely to remain
excessively accommodative for an extended period of time, then
the current benign environment could give way to more serious
inflation further down the road.&#8221; 
Wild Card 
The &#8220;big wild card&#8221; in the global economy is rising trade
tensions between the U.S. and China, Roach said. Chinese exports
rose 48.5 percent in May, helping yield a $19.5 billion trade
surplus for the month. 
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on June 11 that
legislation aimed at getting China to raise the value of its
currency has &#8220;huge&#8221; support in Congress, and Obama &#8220;runs the
risk&#8221; of being overridden if he vetoes it. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m fairly worried given the politics in Washington and
the relatively high unemployment in the U.S.,&#8221; Roach said.
&#8220;The U.S.-China trade imbalance is large, but it&#8217;s important to
keep in mind America ran&#8221; a trade deficit with 90 countries
last year. &#8220;We have a multilateral trade problem because we
don&#8217;t save. You don&#8217;t fix that by forcing one of your partners
to achieve a bilateral currency adjustment.&#8221; 
Roach also said that India needs to raise interest rates to
stem a jump in prices.

Morgan Stanley plans to increase the
number of private bankers in India by 50 percent within a year,
Amitava Neogi, executive director at Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Indian
wealth management unit, said in an interview yesterday. 
&#8220;The wealth in Asia and emerging markets is growing thanks
to economic growth,&#8221; said Mumbai-based Neogi, who plans to add
20 advisers to the 40 employed in the South Asian nation.
&#8220;India has favorable demographics, entrepreneurial spirit and a
growing young population with increasing purchasing power.&#8221; 
India&#8217;s economy expanded 8.6 percent in the three months
through March. The number of billionaires in the nation rose to
52 from 27, Forbes magazine said last year. 
Wealth in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, is
expected to rise at almost double the global rate, according to
an annual study by the Boston Consulting Group. 
The region will increase its share of global wealth from 15
percent last year to almost 20 percent in 2014, with China and
India the engines of growth, according to the report released on
June 10. Together, the two countries will make up 75 percent, or
almost $9 trillion, of the increase in assets managed in the
region. 
Asian billionaires including India&#8217;s Mukesh Ambani and Hong
Kong&#8217;s Li Ka-shing increased their wealth as the region&#8217;s rich
expanded their fortunes at the world&#8217;s quickest pace in the past
year, Forbes said. 
Morgan Stanley plans to double its private bankers in Asia
over the next three years, Charles Mak, head of private wealth
management for Asia, has said. 
The bank is competing with rivals including UBS AG,
Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG to hire financial
advisers in a market with an estimated $7.4 trillion of private
riches. The combined wealth of Asia-Pacific millionaires will
increase 8.8 percent annually until 2018, compared with a global
average of 7.1 percent, according to a report by Capgemini SA
and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. 
Morgan Stanley currently manages about 1,000 family
accounts in India and expects the number to rise to between
2,000 and 3,000 accounts, Neogi said.

Federal investigators must determine
if BP Plc took risks &#8220;beyond industry norms&#8221; with the Gulf of
Mexico well that exploded and caused the worst U.S. oil spill,
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. 
The April 20 disaster that killed 11 workers and sank
Transocean Ltd.&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig &#8220;represents a
dramatic departure&#8221; from the track record of deep-water oil
explorers, Tillerson said in remarks prepared for a House Energy
and Commerce Committee panel hearing today. 
Something went wrong at the BP project about 5,000 feet
(1,524 meters) below the sea surface that hasn&#8217;t happened at the
14,000 other deep-water wells drilled without incident worldwide,
Tillerson said. The catastrophe has damaged livelihoods and
coastal environments and will cause loss of public trust in the
oil industry, he said. 
&#8220;We need to know if the levels of risk taken went beyond
industry norms,&#8221; said Tillerson, who oversees a company that
pumps more oil than every member of OPEC except Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq. 
Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf of Mexico,
he said. Proper well design, workforce training, redundant
safety systems and regular maintenance help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level, Tillerson said in
the remarks. 
&#8216;Questionable Decisions&#8217; 
BP, the biggest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico, made
five &#8220;questionable decisions&#8221; aimed at cutting costs and
speeding completion of an overdue project in the days and weeks
preceding the disaster, U.S. Representatives Henry Waxman of
California and Bart Stupak of Michigan wrote in a letter to BP
CEO Tony Hayward that was released yesterday. 
Hayward is scheduled to testify before U.S. lawmakers on
June 17. David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, said in an e-mail it
would be inappropriate to comment ahead of Hayward&#8217;s testimony. 
Exxon overhauled its safety procedures after the 1989
Valdez tanker spill off the Alaskan coast, Tillerson said in his
remarks. The Valdez incident, which Tillerson described as &#8220;the
low point&#8217; in Exxon&#8217;s history, was one of the worst U.S. spills
before the failure of BP&#8217;s Macondo well. 
John Watson, chief executive officer at Chevron Corp., and
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva are scheduled to testify at
today&#8217;s hearing in Washington. Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the
presidents of the U.S. units of BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
respectively, have also accepted invitations. 
Increased Scrutiny 
Shell follows well-drilling safety standards that lawmakers
have said were sidestepped by BP, Odum said in a May 14 letter
to Elizabeth Birnbaum, former director of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, which oversees the offshore drilling
industry. Shell&#8217;s plans to explore for oil and natural gas off
Alaska&#8217;s coast face increased scrutiny as a result of the Gulf
oil spill. 
&#8220;Shell has design standards and practices that have
enabled us to successfully and safely drill many deep-water and
shallow-water wells worldwide,&#8221; Odum said in the letter to
Birnbaum. &#8220;Shell will rigorously apply an appropriate similar
level of standards in all well operations on the Alaska&#8221; outer
continental shelf. 
More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to stop
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for at least six months while
federal officials conduct a review of offshore safety practices.
The moratorium has forced Exxon, Shell and other major oil
companies to suspend their deepwater exploration plans in the
Gulf. 
Rigs Leaving 
The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil production,
according to the Energy Information Administration. 
When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deep-water oil exploration to resume, there may be few rigs
remaining in the Gulf of Mexico to do the work, said
Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc.
in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil companies on strategy
and risk management. 
Drilling vessels are starting to leave the Gulf to take up
assignments in the South China Sea and offshore Indonesia, said
Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won&#8217;t be able to
return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. 
&#8220;This is a challenging time for everyone in the industry
because there&#8217;s some level of guilt by association going on,&#8221;
Bern said. &#8220;With oil continuing to spew out in the Gulf of
Mexico, the whole industry is going to be set back.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. to recover all claims the
guarantor might have to pay on $378 million of coverage provided
for sewer bonds issued by Jefferson County, Alabama. 
Assured, the top U.S. municipal debt insurer by volume,
said in a lawsuit filed today in New York State Supreme court in
Manhattan that New York-based JPMorgan concealed about $3
million in illegal payments to friends of county commissioners
to ensure it won business with the county. Some of the payments
were then funneled to the officials, the complaint said. 
&#8220;Had JPMorgan and the county not misrepresented and
concealed from Assured the true facts regarding the unlawful
payments that JPMorgan made to secure its position as lead
underwriter for the warrants and swap provider for the county,
Assured never would have issued the policies,&#8221; the lawsuit
said. 
Assured Guaranty is the second bond insurer to sue JPMorgan
over a $3 billion refinancing of sewer debt that collapsed
during the credit crisis and almost bankrupted the county.
Syncora Guaranty Inc. sued JPMorgan and thee county on April 29
alleging they fraudulently obtained more than $1 billion in
insurance coverage for the sewer bonds. 
Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call and e-mail seeking comment. 
JPMorgan arranged the refinancing of the Jefferson County
sewer system in 2002 and 2003, converting the district&#8217;s fixed-
rate debt -- issued so the sewer system was able to comply with
a 1996 federal consent decree -- into floating-rate bonds. 
The obligations were paired with more than $5 billion of
interest-rate swaps, meant to lock in lower borrowing costs. 
Credit Ratings 
The financing fell apart in 2008 when the companies
guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit ratings because of
losses on unrelated mortgage-backed securities. 
In January 2008 Jefferson County&#8217;s interest costs soared
more than threefold to 10 percent. 
Financial Security Assurance Holdings Inc., which was
acquired by Assured Guaranty in July 2009, provided insurance to
the county, which according to the lawsuit included $352 million
of the sewer bonds and a $26.4 million surety bond. Assured has
paid more than $4 million on the surety bond, the suit said. 
Last year, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into the sale of bonds and derivatives to Jefferson County. The
SEC sued two former JPMorgan bankers for making undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioner who owned or worked
at local securities firms that didn&#8217;t do any work on the deals. 
One of those friends, William Blount, the former chairman
of a Montgomery, Alabama, broker dealer, pleaded guilty to
paying $241,000 in bribes to former Jefferson County Commission
president Larry Langford. Langford, who later became the mayor
of Birmingham, is serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison
in Kentucky after being convicted of on bribery and fraud
charges.

Former Walt Disney Co. Chief
Executive Officer Michael Eisner said in a 1999 e-mail that
&#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; was as important to Disney&#8217;s
ABC network as its National Football League deal. 
Eisner, in a second 1999 e-mail also presented today at a
trial, estimated the value of the rights to the game show at
$1 billion and said it would turn ABC around. The e-mails were
introduced as evidence by lawyers for the show&#8217;s creator, which
accuses Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, of cheating
it out of its share of the profit. 
&#8220;Of course we own it and it costs almost nothing,&#8221; Eisner
said in an Aug. 24, 1999, message, shown to the federal court
jury in Riverside, California, by Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for
Celador International Ltd. &#8220;Sometimes the entertainment
business is just wonderful.&#8221; 
Closely held Celador sued Disney six years ago, alleging
Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied promise by
failing to negotiate a higher license fee with Disney&#8217;s ABC
television network after the show became a hit. That prevented
Buena Vista from making a bigger profit that it would have had
to share with the creators, according to London-based Celador. 
Eisner&#8217;s e-mails were allowed as evidence because the
former CEO, who left Burbank, California-based Disney in 2005,
is out of the country and can&#8217;t testify at the trial. The
creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the network
run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; as well as $16 million for merchandising.

Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s failure to deliver
a tablet-friendly version of Windows is forcing big computer
makers like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. to rely on rival
software to help them keep up with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. 
Windows 7, the most recent version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating
system, is too unwieldy for an iPad-like device, said David Daoud, an analyst at IDC. A lighter edition won&#8217;t be ready until
the fourth quarter, giving Apple almost a year&#8217;s head start in
the burgeoning market for tablets. 
&#8220;The Windows world needs to respond,&#8221; said Daoud, whose
firm is based in Framingham, Massachusetts. &#8220;They will have to
play catch-up.&#8221; 
The iPad&#8217;s success caught much of the PC industry by
surprise. Within two months of the April 3 release, Apple sold 2
million iPads -- more than IDC expected for the entire tablet
industry in 2010. To catch up, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are
turning to Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. Taiwanese
manufacturers that build most of the world&#8217;s PCs said they&#8217;re
dissatisfied with Microsoft&#8217;s current lineup. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any choice for now,&#8221; said Joseph Hsu,
chairman and president of Taipei-based manufacturer Micro-Star
International Co., a maker of laptops and computer parts.
Windows 7 is too powerful and consumes too much energy from
batteries, he said. 
The iPad, which can display books, videos and the Internet
on a thin touch screen, will reach sales of 5.5 million units
this year and jump to 13 million next year, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. 
&#8216;Feedback Is Fair&#8217; 
John Kalkman, a vice president in the Microsoft division
that works with computer makers, said the feedback from PC
manufacturers is &#8220;fair.&#8221; Later this year, Microsoft will
release Windows Embedded Compact 7, which will require less
processing power and reduces the drain on batteries. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has tried for more
than a decade to build a market for tablet-sized personal
computers. Chairman Bill Gates predicted in November 2001 that
the tablet would become the most popular form of PC within five
years. 
Demand for the Windows tablets currently sold by Hewlett-
Packard and Dell has been lackluster, according to IDC. Before
the iPad made its debut this year, the researcher had been
forecasting that sales of tablets would decline to less than 1
percent of the overall PC market in the U.S. IDC had predicted
total shipments of just 523,000 tablets.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
American International Group Inc. representatives will appear at
the next hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission as
the panel explores the role of derivatives in the credit crunch. 
The hearing will be held June 30 and July 1 in Washington,
the FCIC said today in a statement on its website. 
AIG was bailed out by the U.S. in 2008 after collateral
calls from Wall Street firms including New York-based Goldman
Sachs on contracts tied to subprime mortgages. Derivatives have
been blamed by lawmakers and investor Warren Buffett for
bringing the financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008. 
The panel, led by former California Treasurer Phil Angelides, will also call witnesses from the U.S. Commodity

OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia&#8217;s
largest mobile phone company, raised $750 million in the biggest
dollar-bond sale by an emerging-market company in almost two
months. 
The 10-year notes were priced at par to yield 8.625
percent, or 531.7 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That compares to a spread of
440 basis points for seven-year, 8 percent dollar bonds the
company sold in January 2005, the last time it tapped
international debt markets. The yield on MTS&#8217;s dollar bonds due
January 2012 surged 220 basis points to 6.116 percent between
April 16 and June 7. The bonds are yielding 5.601 percent today,
a monthly low. 
The sale is the largest offering of dollar debt by a
Russian company since the government sold $5.5 billion of debt
two months ago to set a benchmark that would help develop the
corporate debt market. Yields on emerging-market bonds have
climbed since then on concern the European Union&#8217;s debt crisis
will spread. MTS is the first developing-market company to hold
a bond sale of more than $500 million since April, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8216;Pocket of Cash&#8217; 
&#8220;With longer-term financing unavailable on the domestic
market we believe a limited portion of our debt portfolio should
be in hard currencies providing longer tenure,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer Alexei Kornya said in an e-mailed response to questions
from Bloomberg. &#8220;Any deal around $1 billion with tenure of 10
years extends the average maturity of our debt outstanding by
one year.&#8221; The company seeks to limit the share of foreign-
currency debt to no more than 30 percent, he said. 
MTS sold 60 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) of domestic bonds
between June 2008 and July 2009, according to Bloomberg data, in
a bid to limit its foreign-currency exposure. The company
earlier said the funds raised will be used to refinance its
debt, including a $400 million bond due in October. 
&#8220;There is still ample perception that Russia telecoms are
in a pocket of cash liquidity, which explains their easy access
to the markets, even under shaky risk aversion conditions,&#8221;
said Luis Costa, an emerging market debt strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in London. &#8220;There is hidden liquidity out there to invest
in cash-rich corporations.&#8221; 
Domestic Funding 
The company&#8217;s debt is rated Ba2, two levels below
investment grade, by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and an equivalent
BB at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. The bond sale was organized by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. 
&#8220;Russian companies are able to issue on international
markets again, but they are not in a rush given attractive
funding alternatives domestically&#8221; said Mikhail Galkin, an
analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow. &#8220;MTS will be a rare issuer of
dollar debt going forward as its financial strategy suggests
debt should be mainly in local currency.&#8221;

The Securities and Exchange
Commission pressed JPMorgan Chase  Co. to tell investors more
about mounting demands to buy back defective mortgages, an
obligation that cost the four biggest U.S. lenders about $5
billion last year. 
The SEC asked the New York-based company to disclose more
about reserves set aside to cover the cost of repurchasing bad
loans it sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors,
according to a Jan. 29 letter released today. The SEC also told
the bank to provide more details on when and how it recognizes
losses on mortgages that have been modified as well as on soured
credit-card debt. 
&#8220;What they&#8217;re asking for is a lot more than the banks put
out in the public domain right now,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a
bank analyst at Torrance, California-based Institutional Risk
Analytics. &#8220;This is going to make life uncomfortable for a lot
of the banks, because once they start mandating this kind of
disclosures, it&#8217;s going to stay.&#8221; 
Lenders that sell mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
have to provide warranties assuring that the loans conformed to
the agencies&#8217; standards. With more loans going bad, the
government-sponsored companies are demanding that banks turn
over loan files so they can scour the records for missing
documentation, inaccurate data and fraud, information that can
be used to force loan buybacks. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, seized by federal regulators in
September 2008, asked the bank to repurchase $2.7 billion in
defective loans in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008, JPMorgan said.
The lender held $2 billion in reserves at the end of the first
quarter against future buyback requests. 
Defective Loans 
Of the total requested, JPMorgan repurchased $1.1 billion
in defective loans in 2009 and has offered more than 750,000
borrowers trial modifications to try to &#8220;cure&#8221; their
delinquent loans, JPMorgan said in a separate filing. About
127,000 received permanent repayment plans. The bank&#8217;s mortgage
portfolio swelled to $292.6 billion from $115.8 billion from
2006 through 2008. The company&#8217;s response to the SEC sheds new
light on the company&#8217;s worst-performing loans made during the
housing boom. 
In requesting the information, SEC staff told JPMorgan
Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh that their comments and
the company&#8217;s response &#8220;do not foreclose the commission from
taking any action with respect to the filing.&#8221; The SEC
concluded its review of JPMorgan&#8217;s loan-loss disclosures, which
the bank included in a Jan. 15 securities filing, on May 3. SEC
spokesman John Heine and JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti
declined to comment. 
More Demands 
Before 2008, demands from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
weren&#8217;t significant, JPMorgan told the SEC in its March 2
response. &#8220;However, beginning in 2008, JPMorgan Chase
experienced a higher volume of demands; these demand volumes
have steadily increased every quarter,&#8221; Corporate Controller
Louis Rauchenberger told the SEC. 
Washington-based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in McLean,
Virginia, may ask U.S. banks to repurchase $17.2 billion in
faulty loans this year, Oppenheimer  Co. analyst Chris Kotowski
estimated. Kotowski said in a June 9 report that U.S. banks
could lose $6 billion this year when those loans are returned
and get marked down to their true value. 
&#8220;It is a problem that will continue to drag on the big
banks to the tune of several hundred million per quarter, but
it&#8217;s not a problem that is mushrooming out of control,&#8221;
Kotowski said. 
Third Parties 
JPMorgan told the SEC that 75 percent of its current
repurchase requests stem from loans originated in 2007 and 2008
and that it is able to file claims against third-party
originators on 40 percent of all repurchase requests. 
The SEC questioned the bank&#8217;s calculations for its
allowance for loan losses, relating to breaches in the
agreements it has with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other
mortgage investors. 
&#8220;Estimating the allowance is highly subjective, and is
further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical
data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors,&#8221;
JPMorgan said.

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, alleged that Mylan Inc., the biggest U.S. generic
pharmaceuticals maker, infringed three patents for Sutent, a
drug used to treat cancerous tumors of the digestive tract and
kidneys. 
Pfizer&#8217;s lawsuit contends Mylan violated its patent rights
by filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to market copies of Sutent before the patents
expire, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware. 
&#8220;Sutent has annual sales of about $1 billion&#8221; and
&#8220;Pfizer will suffer irreparable injury&#8221; unless the
infringement is stopped, the company&#8217;s lawyers said in court
papers. 
In April, New York-based Pfizer said it halted a study of
Sutent as a treatment for advanced liver cancer after observing
complications in test patients. The company said it will
continue studying Sutent&#8217;s use to fight other types of cancer. 
Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, reported sales of
$5.09 billion last year.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s painkiller Celebrex
causes less bleeding and fewer ulcers in the gastrointestinal
tract than a combination of generic pain pills and heartburn
drugs, a company-funded study found. 
Arthritis patients taking Celebrex were four times less
likely to start bleeding anywhere from the stomach to the colon
than those given the generic pain drug diclofenac and
AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec, a heartburn medicine that reduces
acid production. The six-month study was presented today at the
Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in Rome and
published in The Lancet. 
Because chronic use of traditional painkillers is linked to
ulcers, doctors recommend either Celebrex or combination
treatment for arthritis patients who need regular treatment.
While previous studies showed they have similar effects on the
stomach, this is the first to examine the entire digestive
tract. The findings should be taken into account when
prescribing pain treatment for arthritis sufferers, the
researchers said. 
The study &#8220;has provided new data relevant to patients
requiring anti-inflammatory therapy,&#8221; said the researchers, led
by Francis K.L. Chan from the department of medicine at Prince
of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. 
The results come from one of two studies New York-based
Pfizer is counting on to boost sales of Celebrex. The drug never
fully recovered after the product&#8217;s main rival, Merck  Co.&#8217;s
Vioxx, was pulled off the market because of its ties to heart
attacks in 2004. Celebrex sales peaked at $3.3 billion that
year. The drug generated $2.4 billion in 2009. 
Too Short 
The scientists tracked 4,484 patients with osteoarthritis
or rheumatoid arthritis who were at risk for developing ulcers
or other gastrointestinal problems. After six months, 0.9
percent on Celebrex and 3.8 percent given the pain and heartburn
combination developed bleeding, ulcers or anemia. More patients
getting the combination dropped out of the study because of side
effects. 
The short duration of the study limits its usefulness,
since arthritis patients tend to take the drugs for years, Elham
Rahme and Sasha Bernatsky from McGill University Health Center
in Montreal, wrote in a Lancet editorial.

Pfizer Inc. faces a Texas trial over
its hormone-replacement drugs after a court overseeing lawsuits
over the medicines sent 200 cases back to their home courts. 
A judge in Galveston, Texas, last week set a May 2011 trial
date for Karen Zahn&#8217;s claims against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit. Zahn
says in her suit that the Prempro menopause drug helped cause
her breast cancer. It&#8217;s one of the first of more than 8,000
lawsuits over the medicine consolidated in federal court in
Arkansas to be returned for trial, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said. 
U.S. District Judge William Wilson in Little Rock,
Arkansas, is supervising pretrial proceedings in the cases
against Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn, another Pfizer unit. He
returned the 200 cases to their courts in March and told lawyers
to get another 400 ready to be sent back later this year. 
&#8220;Pfizer is now going to have to gear up and hire lawyers
all over the country to try these cases,&#8221; said Carl Tobias, a
professor at the University of Richmond law school who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. &#8220;That makes things more expensive and
may provide some incentive to settle.&#8221; 
More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study concluded they posed
an increased breast-cancer risk. 
Menopause Medicines 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. 
Officials of New York-based Pfizer said while Wilson has
sent back some cases, he refused plaintiffs&#8217; requests to send
back all the suits at one time. 
&#8220;No decision has been made about how many additional cases
will be remanded or when,&#8221; Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in
an e-mailed statement. It also isn&#8217;t clear how many of the
remanded cases will go to trial, he added. 
For example, plaintiffs May 25 dismissed a case filed by
Linda Cardwell that Wilson sent back to a federal court in
Alexandria, Virginia, Loder noted. 
Both sides still must exchange case-specific information on
the remanded claims, Loder said. Pfizer lawyers also may ask
judges to throw some cases out. 
Wilson is overseeing cases as part of the multidistrict
litigation system, which allows suits filed in courts around the
U.S. to be consolidated before a single judge for pretrial
hearings. 
Saving on Expenses 
Once pretrial information exchanges are done, the cases are
sent back to the courts where they were originally filed for
trial. Consolidation cuts down on expenses for both sides. 
Such consolidations often lead to so-called global
settlements of litigations over drugs. In 2000, Wyeth agreed to
a $3.76 billion accord to resolve suits over its fen-phen diet
combination after the cases were consolidated before a federal
judge in Philadelphia. 
Loder refused to comment on whether Pfizer will seek to
settle the remaining Prempro cases before Wilson. The company
faces at least 8,000 Prempro claims, Wyeth officials said in a
2009 regulatory filing. 
&#8220;Pfizer will continue to vigorously defend its hormone
therapy medicines,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;We do not comment
on the number of cases pending, nor do we comment on our legal
strategy.&#8221; 
13,000 Cases 
Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for women suing over the menopause
drugs, said she expects to have many of the 200 cases set for
trial within the next 12 months. She estimates there may be more
than 13,000 Prempro cases pending before Wilson and state court
judges in Philadelphia. 
&#8220;Most of the hard work has been done on these cases, and
it&#8217;s time for women to get their days in court,&#8221; she said. 
Littlepage represents Zahn, a retired school receptionist
from Manvel, Texas. The 57-year-old woman took Prempro for
almost three years starting in January 1999. She was diagnosed
with breast cancer in November 2002. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston on June 9 set
the trial of Zahn&#8217;s suit in Galveston for next May 16,
Littlepage said. 
Wyeth has lost seven out of the 11 jury trials over the
menopause drugs. The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown
out at the post-trial stage and or had awards reduced. 
3,000 Cases Dismissed 
Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, Loder said. 
A judge in Philadelphia refused last month to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in 2003
as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. 
Upjohn has lost all three cases juries have considered over
Provera. A Pennsylvania judge ruled last month the Pfizer unit
deserved a new trial in a 2007 case that ended with a $1.5
million jury award. 
The case is In Re Prempro Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Little
Rock).

General Motors Co. board member Kent Kresa, who served as interim chairman during the automaker&#8217;s
bankruptcy, will retire as a director as soon as July, said two
people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Kresa, who joined the board in 2003, turned 72 in March and
will not stand for re-election, said the people, who asked not
to be identified revealing internal discussions. GM added a 13th
director, Cynthia Telles, an associate clinical professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles, in April and she will
take Kresa&#8217;s place when he retires, the people said. 
The departure would leave four directors from the old
General Motors Corp. and eight who joined since the new GM
emerged from bankruptcy. That may help GM convince potential
investors its board has a fresh perspective as it prepares for
an initial stock sale, said Charles Elson, director of the John
L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of
Delaware. 
&#8220;New blood would probably make some sense,&#8221; said Elson. 
Kathryn Marinello, another director, tendered her
resignation from GM&#8217;s board after she left her last job as
chairman and CEO of Minneapolis-based human resources firm
Ceridian Corp. in January. GM&#8217;s corporate governance guidelines
state that when a director&#8217;s job changes &#8220;from the position he
or she held when originally invited to join the board, the
director will tender a letter of resignation.&#8221;

Five years ago, investors
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Carlyle Group put up
$500 million in seed money to hunt for oil in the deep waters
of the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. 
After the BP Plc oil spill, smaller Gulf operators such
as the Goldman startup, Cobalt International Energy Inc., may
be swept up in a wave of consolidation as the regulatory
landscape tilts in favor of larger firms, said William Herbert, an analyst at Houston-based Simmons  Co. 
Tougher rules are likely to boost costs and slow the
pace of drilling, said Scott Van Bergh, co-head of Americas
energy and power investment banking at Bank of America Corp.
Companies may also face higher liability caps and
requirements to post some clean-up costs in advance. That may
make drilling in the Gulf feasible for only the world&#8217;s
largest energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Total
SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Norway&#8217;s Statoil ASA and
Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd. 
The rules Congress enacts &#8220;are likely to favor larger
operators over smaller ones,&#8221; Van Bergh said. &#8220;People are
thinking about who will want to exit, and who will want to
become consolidators.&#8221; 
BHP Firepower 
Cobalt, founded in Houston in 2005 by the former
president of Unocal Corp., Joseph Bryant, operates in the
deep waters of the Gulf and the West African coast and went
public last year. The shares lost about 44 percent since the
spill on April 20, giving Cobalt a market value of about $2.8
billion. 
Houston-based Plains Exploration  Production Co., with
a market value of about $3.3 billion, and Cobalt may be
targets for BHP, the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
according to a report last month by Deutsche Bank AG analysts. 
BHP already has four operating energy projects in the
Gulf, three of which are joint ventures with BP. The
Melbourne-based company has the &#8220;firepower to do enormous
things,&#8221; J. Michael Yeager, the chief executive officer of
BHP&#8217;s petroleum unit, said on a May 24 conference call. 
BHP is capable of spending as much as $20 billion to
acquire Gulf assets, including BP project stakes that may come
up for sale, Citigroup Inc. Sydney-based analyst Clarke Wilkins
said in an interview today. 
&#8216;Public Enemy&#8217; 
&#8220;BP is public enemy number one in the U.S. at the moment,
and if there is any forced divestment of assets, BHP is in a
strong position to be able to pick them up,&#8221; Wilkins said. 
BHP, a partner with BP in the Atlantis, Mad Dog and
Gunflint ventures, may increase its stakes in those projects, he
said. BP&#8217;s share of those assets is worth $11 billion, Wilkins
estimated in a June 16 report. 
Amanda Buckley, a spokeswoman for BHP, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation. Cobalt spokesman Rich Smith
didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. Andrea Raphael of
Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did a spokesman for
Riverstone Holdings LLC, which sponsors a fund with Carlyle
that invested in Cobalt. Spokespeople for Plains didn&#8217;t
return calls. 
The oil and gas business is one of the busier sectors in
a slumping merger market this year, accounting for $68.8
billion of deals, or about 8.4 percent of the total across
all industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil
and gas deals accounted for 5.9 percent of global takeovers
during the previous decade. 
&#8216;Buoyant Market&#8217; 
Energy mergers and acquisitions may produce a &#8220;buoyant
market&#8221; in 2010, according to Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. 
Still, it may be months or years before Gulf players get
a clear enough understanding of the new regulatory
environment to do deals, said Bank of America&#8217;s Van Bergh. 
The U.S. Justice Department has begun a probe into the
BP oil leak, and President Barack Obama put a six-month ban
on offshore drilling. Congress is also considering removing
the $75 million limit on economic losses from oil spills that
large companies must pay. BP agreed this week to set up a $20
billion fund to pay victims and the spill had cost it more
than $1.2 billion as of June 11. 
&#8220;Costs will go up to operate in the region and that
could make it quite difficult for smaller companies,&#8221; said
Peter Chilton, an investment analyst at Sydney-based
Constellation Capital Management Ltd. 
Anadarko, Noble 
The changing economics of deep-water drilling have
prompted investor doubts about one $2.7 billion deal struck
just before the spill. Mariner Energy Inc. shares dropped
about 7.7 percent since the spill amid concern an agreed sale
to Apache Corp. may unravel. Apache is committed to
completing the deal and expects to do so after getting
regulatory and shareholder approval, probably in the third
quarter, said spokesman Bill Mintz. 
It&#8217;s too early to say how the BP spill will affect
Total&#8217;s plans for exploration, said Phenelope Semavoine, a
spokeswoman for Total in Paris. Alan Jeffers of Exxon Mobil
and Paula Almada of Petrobras declined to comment. Ola Morten Aanestad, a Statoil spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment. 
&#8220;Today the industry is focused very much on the spill
itself, but we believe that many are thinking about what the
longer-term implications will be as an operator in the deep-
water Gulf,&#8221; said Bank of America&#8217;s Van Bergh. 
Anadarko, Noble 
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Noble Energy Inc. are among
companies that may opt to sell their deep-water Gulf assets,
according to Simmons&#8217;s Herbert. Anadarko, which owns a stake
in BP&#8217;s leaking well, has dropped 43 percent since the spill.
Houston-based Noble, which got about 10 percent of 2009
production from the deep-water Gulf, is down 15 percent. 
Anadarko said on June 3 it may shift capital spending to
projects outside the Gulf. The Woodlands, Texas-based company
got about a fourth of its production from the Gulf in 2009,
according to a regulatory filing. Spokesmen for Anadarko and
Noble declined to comment. 
&#8220;The risk premium for deep-water, highly pressured
reserves has gone up,&#8221; Herbert said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a seller&#8217;s
market.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp., a sponsor of this week&#8217;s U.S. Open golf tournament, is
counting on Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and the rest of the
world&#8217;s top golfers to showcase its Web technology. 
The company developed a smartphone app that lets users
track the tournament and players&#8217; statistics. It even shows a
so-called heat map of the course in Pebble Beach, California,
revealing the most challenging holes. IBM also helps manage
security, video and other features for the U.S. Open&#8217;s website. 
IBM&#8217;s strategy isn&#8217;t about reaching more golf-loving
consumers. Instead, it wants to show business customers how its
technology can handle a huge surge in traffic without breaking
the bank. While the number of people using the U.S. Open site
jumped from a year earlier, IBM was able to cut the cost per
user by 25 percent, said John Kent, program manager for the
company&#8217;s sponsorship marketing. 
&#8220;When we talk to our customers about that, they have the
very same issues,&#8221; Kent said. 
IBM declined to say how much it spends on the U.S. Open or
what kind of return it gets from the event. The Armonk, New
York-based company also sponsors the Masters Golf Tournament, as
well as the U.S. Open tennis match and Wimbledon. 
IBM fell 83 cents to $130.15 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The shares are little changed this year. 
IPad Version 
This is the second year in a row that IBM has offered an
iPhone app for the U.S. Open. About 286,000 people downloaded
the software last year. This time around, it also runs on Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad and other smartphones such as the Droid. IBM already
had 150,000 downloads by the first day of play. 
The software gives up-to-the-minute scores and data for
each competitor, and the map indicates whether players are
shooting above or below par on each hole. The website also has
high-definition coverage of the tournament. 
IBM invites corporate customers to see its Web operations
up close by visiting a trailer near the course. A staff of more
than a dozen, supplied with Twizzlers and a mini-fridge filled
with energy drinks, monitors global Internet security threats
and viewership numbers. 
&#8220;Our clients love golf,&#8221; said Rick Singer, IBM&#8217;s vice
president for client executive marketing. &#8220;These relationships
are all about business, and how we can further the perception of
IBM, and really sell stuff.&#8221; 
On the first day of the tournament, the heat map showed the
difficulty of the Pebble Beach course, which is located about
two hours from San Francisco. Woods and Mickelson, the world&#8217;s
two best golfers, failed to make a single birdie -- a score
that&#8217;s one stroke under par -- during the opening round. 
Inside IBM&#8217;s trailer, the heat map was displayed on a 52-
inch flat screen. Kent pointed to a red blob where players were
performing better than expected. 
&#8220;It looks like six is the only &#8216;easy&#8217; hole out there,&#8221; he
said.

Pfizer Inc. will withdraw its blood
cancer drug Mylotarg after 10 years on the U.S. market because
studies didn&#8217;t prove it works and the treatment was linked to
deaths from liver and lung complications. 
Mylotarg, for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, is the first
medicine to be pulled off the market that was cleared through
the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s accelerated approval program,
the agency said today in a statement. Pfizer volunteered to halt
sales after trial results raised safety concerns &#8220;and the drug
failed to demonstrate clinical benefit,&#8221; the FDA said. 
Mylotarg was approved in 2000 based on preliminary data
showing improved remission rates, with a requirement for more
complete trials to prove it extended survival. Wyeth, which sold
Mylotarg before being purchased by Pfizer in October, didn&#8217;t
start mandated follow-up research until 2004 and didn&#8217;t provide
results until this year. 
&#8220;Accelerated approval still has a place in the approval
process but it&#8217;s also more important that we learn over the
years that the whole development plan be set up well in
advance,&#8221; said Robert Kane, acting deputy director for safety
in the FDA&#8217;s Division of Hematology Products, in a phone
interview today. &#8220;The trials should be planned and if possible
under way when the sponsor submits the application.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the

failed to win bankruptcy court permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn in Jacksonville,
Florida, today denied Goldman&#8217;s request to lift the automatic
stay, a part of the bankruptcy code that shields a company from
creditors&#8217; efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs
Mortgage is a division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in Ponte Vedra
Beach by RQB Resort LP and RQB Development. New York-based
Goldman Sachs, owed about $192.5 million as of Jan. 10, hasn&#8217;t
been paid since August. 
The property, purchased in 2006, was valued at $135.3
million in an appraisal ordered by Goldman. David J. O&#8217;Halloran,
chief executive officer for RQB&#8217;s U.S. operation, told the court
the group believes the resort should be valued in the
$90 million to $100 million range. 
RQB Resort listed assets and debt of as much as $500
million each in Chapter 11 documents filed March 1 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. RQB Development also sought
protection. 
RQB sought and received a six-month extension of the
exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. The new deadline
is Dec. 29.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s appeal of a verdict for an Arkansas woman who
blamed the company&#8217;s menopause drugs for her breast cancer,
leaving intact a $2.7 million award that may grow with punitive
damages. 
The justices today let stand a lower court decision
upholding that award, which marked the first federal verdict
against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement
treatment. 
The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit sought to
leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a
new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27
million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all
aspects of the case, including the jury&#8217;s finding that the drugs
helped cause Donna Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. 
&#8220;While we are disappointed with the court&#8217;s decision, it
does not change the prior ruling by the appeals court, which
affirmed the dismissal of punitive damages as to Upjohn and
ordered a new trial on punitive damages for Wyeth,&#8221; Pfizer said
in a statement. 
Scroggin was among 6 million women who took the pills to
treat menopause symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and
mood swings. Wyeth faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the
medicines, which are still on the market. 
Scroggin and other women contend company executives ignored
studies raising questions about the link between hormone-
replacement drugs and breast cancer to pump up sales of their
drugs. 
Health Risks 
The Supreme Court action &#8220;validates our evidence that
shows Wyeth hid the health risks of this drug and the drugs
caused breast cancer in thousands of women,&#8221; Jim Morris,
Scroggin&#8217;s lawyer, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;We are
looking forward to asking another jury to decide the extent of
Wyeth&#8217;s wrongful conduct.&#8221; 
Scroggin took three menopause drugs: Provera, a progestin-
laden treatment made by what is now Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit;
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, and Prempro, a
combination of the two other drugs introduced by Wyeth in 1996. 
Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before a 2002 study sponsored by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health suggested women using the medicines had a
higher breast cancer risk. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, bought Wyeth last year in a $68 billion
transaction. 
Jury&#8217;s Decision 
The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision not to review the case isn&#8217;t
surprising since the appellate court left the jury&#8217;s decisions
on liability and actual damages undisturbed, said Carl Tobias, a
professor at University of Richmond Law School who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. 
The denial &#8220;is a good sign for plaintiffs going forward&#8221;
with Prempro claims, Tobias said today in an e-mail. 
Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by juries since the cases began going to trial in
2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out at the post-
trial stage and or had awards reduced. 
Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. 
Pfizer&#8217;s appeal in the Scroggin case centered on the
Constitution&#8217;s Seventh Amendment, which guarantees the right to
a jury trial in federal civil cases. In a separate line of
argument, the company contended that the trial judge should have
excluded the testimony of an oncologist who testified that the
hormone treatments caused Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. 
Pfizer shares fell 11 cents to $15.10 at 4:00 p.m. New York
time. After the headlines were published, Pfizer shares fell as
much as 2.4 percent, from an opening high of $15.38 to an
afternoon low of $15.01. 
The case is Wyeth v. Scroggin, 09-1123.

strongly believe in the broadband wireless market and especially
in Italy, where only a wireless solution can really solve
internet access issues.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs and Icon, whose group owns about 60 percent
of Aria, are pitted against a bid from a team led by minority
shareholder Gilo Ventures, according to three people with
knowledge of the talks. Icon&#8217;s group is offering around 100
million euros ($124 million), said one of the people, who
declined to be identified before the acquisition is agreed. 
AriaDSL, the Dutch parent of the Italian Wimax operator,
was declared bankrupt on March 2. The struggle for control of
the company began six months earlier after it hit a &#8220;liquidity
shortage,&#8221; according court papers filed in April by the
bankruptcy trustee, who is seeking a buyer for the company. 
Officials for Goldman in London declined to comment. Davidi Gilo, founder of Gilo Ventures, also declined to comment. 
In December, most shareholders agreed to short-term funding
through a convertible bond that would be sold in three stages.
The investment would have given the company access to a 75
million-euro bank loan, the court papers show, cash that would
have been invested to build more base stations, the people said. 
Financing Fails 
A conflict among shareholders led that shareholder
financing to fail, the court documents show. Only the first of
the three payments was made and a number of shareholders, which
the documents don&#8217;t identify, requested that AriaDSL pay back
the loan. The shareholders sought the bankruptcy after failing
to get their money back, the documents show. 
Goldman and Icon&#8217;s interest Aria in began in 2008 when they
led a group that injected 55 million euros into AriaDSL to help
it fund a 48 million-euro purchase of six Wimax licenses, court
papers show. Goldman was involved through both its asset
management unit and its special situations group, which mainly
invests in distressed assets. 
As part of the license agreement, Aria pledged to build 700
base stations by Nov. 1. To boost its reach, in June 2009 Aria
and Telecom Italia SpA said Aria would use Telecom Italia&#8217;s
Wimax frequencies in Italy&#8217;s central and southern regions. In
exchange, Telecom Italia agreed to sell Aria&#8217;s broadband
services to its own clients. By April, Aria had built only about
120 base stations and the company isn&#8217;t likely to meet its
licensing target, according to the court documents. 
For Icon, Aria remains a long-term project. 
&#8220;We look at investments on a four-to-five year horizon and
the same here,&#8221; said Icon&#8217;s Dmitriev. &#8220;We have good experience
with Wimax in Russia and Ukraine, so we can use our scale of
operations to buy equipment cheaper.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. accused
Barclays Plc of misleading a federal judge when it bought Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s defunct brokerage in the falling
markets of September 2008, said a Lehman lawyer, citing a letter
from JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon. 
Barclays Group Chief Executive John Varley was asked by
Lehman lawyer Robert Gaffey in federal court in Manhattan today
about what he characterized as &#8220;two big-time bankers in a very
big dispute.&#8221; 
Gaffey said Dimon wrote to Varley and Barclays President
Robert Diamond, saying the court was misinformed about the
Barclays deal. JPMorgan had asked Barclays to participate in an
accounting of the transaction and they declined, Dimon said in
the letter, according to Gaffey. 
&#8220;I could refute him point by point but he&#8217;s not here,&#8221;
Varley said. &#8220;I inwardly groaned when I read it because I knew
that there were a number of points on which Jamie Dimon and I
would disagree.&#8221; 
Varley was the second witness today in a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court trial over Lehman&#8217;s claim that the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest
bank should pay it as much as $11 billion for an allegedly
undisclosed &#8220;windfall&#8221; on the deal for the brokerage. The
purchase was approved by Judge James Peck and closed a week
after Lehman&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S.
history. 
Custodial Account 
JPMorgan around that time had taken $7 billion out of a
Barclays custodial account, according to Varley. 
&#8220;I was deeply unhappy that without our consent a large
amount of money had been taken out of our account,&#8221; Varley
said. He interpreted the letter about misleading the court as a
device by JPMorgan to distract attention from the dispute over
money, he said. 
Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the dispute, which was later settled. 
Separately, Lehman in May sued JPMorgan to recover tens of
billions of dollars in &#8220;lost value,&#8221; accusing the bank of
precipitating its downfall and preventing it from winding down
in an orderly fashion. Evangelisti said the lawsuit was &#8220;ill
conceived.&#8221; 
Earlier, Varley said the week when Barclays bought the
Lehman brokerage was &#8220;the riskiest week of my life.&#8221; 
&#8220;Markets were collapsing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We needed to ensure
there was a buffer between assets and liabilities. We needed to
be able to look regulators in the eye and say the deal would be
capital accretive.&#8221; 
Protect Our Ratios 
&#8220;This was a time when there was a great deal of focus by
supervisors around the world, including the U.K. Financial
Services Authority and the Bank of England, on capital ratios,
and it was clear to me that the only circumstances in which I
could look our regulators in the eye, and indeed look our
shareholders in the eye, would be if we were able to protect our
capital ratios,&#8221; Varley said. 
&#8220;To put it another way, were we not capable of doing that,
then I was not prepared to recommend that we should proceed to
the board&#8221; of Barclays, he said. 
Lehman lawyer Gaffey has tried to prove that Barclays made
a safe, or &#8220;derisked&#8221; acquisition, and took more assets out of
the defunct firm than it should have without telling the court. 
&#8220;You expected an immediate profit&#8221; on the brokerage
purchase? Gaffey asked. 
&#8220;Yes we did,&#8221; Varley said. &#8220;That&#8217;s because we expected
the income we generated to exceed costs.&#8221; 
BofA Balked 
Today&#8217;s first witness, Barclays President Diamond, said the
bank had qualms about acquiring Lehman&#8217;s brokerage after Bank of
America Corp. balked at buying it. 
&#8220;BofA walked away from an opportunity to do a deal with
Lehman at some distressed price,&#8221; said Diamond, who runs
Barclays&#8217;s corporate and investment banking operations. &#8220;But
they paid $50 billion for Merrill Lynch. That created real
concern for us. What had they seen?&#8221; 
Diamond was responding to questions from Barclays&#8217;s lawyer
David Boies about the bank&#8217;s concerns when it bought Lehman and
why it sought to buffer itself from risk by staking claim to
assets in the brokerage business. 
&#8220;BofA could have bought it for about $1 billion,&#8221; Diamond
said. &#8220;They walked away and paid $50 billion for Merrill. It
reinforced in Varley and myself and our board what a risky
environment we were working in.&#8221; 
Government Help 
&#8220;When JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns it got government
help,&#8221; Diamond said. &#8220;Barclays wasn&#8217;t able to get help. So it
was especially important to get the values and commitments we
had received or we couldn&#8217;t go forward. There were hours when we
were expecting not to execute on the deal.&#8221; 
Lehman, which wants money to pay off creditors, has accused
the London-based bank of making a &#8220;secret&#8221; asset raid on
Lehman that wasn&#8217;t disclosed to the court. The brokerage&#8217;s
trustee, James Giddens, has said changes were secretly inserted
in the sale contract without notice to him or Lehman&#8217;s lawyers.
He wants $6.7 billion from Barclays to pay hedge funds and other
institutional clients of Lehman. 
Lehman&#8217;s lawyers are beginning to wrap up their case after
more than two weeks of testimony by former Lehman executives,
advisers and Barclays officials. 
The U.K. bank&#8217;s lawyers have tried to show when questioning
Lehman&#8217;s witnesses that all the key facts of the deal were known
by the main players. They are scheduled to present Barclays&#8217;s
side of the story starting Aug. 23. Barclays, which announced a
gain on its purchase on Sept. 17, 2008, has said it owes Lehman
nothing and wants $3 billion that is being withheld by the
trustee. 
Lehman spent $794 million on lawyers, advisers and managers
in 19 months through April, with $277.4 million going to Lehman
CEO Bryan Marsal&#8217;s restructuring firm, Alvarez  Marsal. Marsal
has said he will spend five years selling assets to pay
unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the dollar. Any
proceeds from litigation would add to the payout. 
The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Jamie Dimon, the chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., named longtime associate Heidi Miller to the new post of president of JPMorgan International as
part of a management shuffle to groom an eventual successor. 
Miller, 57, who had been executive vice president for
Treasury and Securities Services, will be replaced by Chief
Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh, 44. Doug Braunstein, 49,
head of Investment Banking Americas, will succeed Cavanagh as
CFO, the company said in a statement today. 
Dimon, 54, said in March that he planned to rotate senior
executives across business lines as part of a succession plan.
Miller&#8217;s working relationship with Dimon spans about two
decades, including stints at Travelers Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Bank One Corp. and JPMorgan. 
&#8220;This is someone who has the capability of staring Jamie
Dimon down, so that&#8217;s obviously served her well,&#8221; said Duff
McDonald, author of &#8220;Last Man Standing: The Ascent of Jamie
Dimon and JPMorgan Chase.&#8221; &#8220;The fact that he&#8217;s chosen her to
take on this new and expanded role should surprise nobody.&#8221; 
The move gives Cavanagh, who has never run a business
division at JPMorgan, operational experience as a possible
successor to Dimon, McDonald said. Cavanagh worked with Dimon at
Primerica and Citigroup before joining Bank One, where Dimon had
become CEO, in 2000. He was named CFO of JPMorgan after Dimon
sold his lender to the bank in 2004. 
Dealmaker 
Braunstein has been one of JPMorgan&#8217;s most prolific
dealmakers for corporate clients. He is also Dimon&#8217;s go-to
banker for his own acquisitions after working across the
negotiating table from him during the Bank One sale. Braunstein
helped JPMorgan seal a deal to buy Bear Stearns Cos. during a
weekend of frenzied negotiating in 2008. The company said it
will announce Braunstein&#8217;s replacement soon. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s grooming multiple potential successors,&#8221; said
Bradley Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein  Co. &#8220;Jamie
hasn&#8217;t made a decision about who&#8217;s going to take over, and he&#8217;s
got time to see how they do in their new roles.&#8221; 
Since 2004, Miller has run JPMorgan&#8217;s Treasury  Securities
Services unit, which provides clients with payment-processing
and cash-management services. 
Miller turned around the business and generated stable
returns throughout the economic crisis, Hintz said. JPMorgan
credited her with producing &#8220;record increases in net revenue
and net income&#8221; during her tenure at the unit, which processes
an average of $3.7 trillion in transfers daily and has $15.3
trillion in assets under custody. 
Competing With Citigroup 
As head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Global Corporate Bank, Miller will
lead the company&#8217;s expansion plans in emerging markets like
China, Brazil, India and Russia, regions where JPMorgan will
battle Citigroup for business, said Anthony Polini, a banking
analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. More than half of
Citigroup&#8217;s total revenue comes from overseas, compared with
about a quarter at JPMorgan, Polini said. 
&#8220;This is a key play to get a piece of the pie that Citi
has a bigger slice of right now,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;The projected
growth rate for those economies are two or three times greater
than the projected growth rates of the U.S.&#8221; 
Shares of JPMorgan, which have fallen 6 percent this year
compared with a 3 percent advance in the SP 500 Financials
Index, were little changed as of 12:53 p.m. in New York trading
at $39.19.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, reduced its price
forecasts for crude oil because commodity markets are
&#8220;fragile&#8221; on concern growth in Europe and China will slow. 
West Texas Intermediate oil, traded in New York, was
forecast at $100 a barrel in 2011, down 9.1 percent from its
previous prediction of $110, Goldman said in a report today. The
bank also downgraded prices for three-month, six-month and 12-
month crude and for Brent oil, traded in London. 
&#8220;Commodity markets are generally rebounding strongly off
their lows but sentiment remains fragile on European and Chinese
concerns,&#8221; said analysts led by New York-based Allison Nathan.
&#8220;Markets will remain fragile until there is further evidence
that sovereign pressures are stabilizing and global trend
economic growth remains intact.&#8221; 
Oil in New York has gained more than 10 percent so far in
June, set for the biggest monthly increase since October, amid
speculation global demand for fuels will recover as Europe
overcomes its debt crisis. Futures yesterday reached a six-week
high of $78.92 a barrel after China, the world&#8217;s second-largest
energy consumer, signaled an end to the yuan&#8217;s fixed rate to the
dollar, a move that may boost the country&#8217;s purchasing power. 
&#8220;We have lowered our three-month oil and base metals price
forecasts but to levels still above current prices, and maintain
a positive medium-term view of key commodities,&#8221; the analysts
said. 
Goldman said the market is &#8220;overestimating&#8221; any negative
impact of government policies on growth and has discounted
possible constraints on oil supply in the future. 
&#8216;Too Bearish&#8217; 
&#8220;Sentiment is too bearish on both the sovereign-debt risks
as well as the effects of macroeconomic momentum slowing,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;Despite some macro slowing, absolute growth
indicators are still firmly positive.&#8221; 
WTI, a low-sulfur crude, is the reference grade for futures
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent is quoted
in oil contracts at the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. 
&#8220;Implied demand for key commodities has remained at
exceptionally high levels in the emerging markets,&#8221; the Goldman
analysts said. &#8220;Developed market demand has generally surprised
to the upside.&#8221; 
WTI contracts for December delivery have gained $3.40 a
barrel since a May 10 buy recommendation, according to the
report. 
Global fuel consumption will increase 2 percent this year
to a record 86.4 million barrels a day, the International Energy
Agency predicted June 10. 
The following tables show Goldman Sach&#8217;s price forecasts
for crude, in dollars a barrel.

Shanghai will have more than half of
Asia&#8217;s stock market liquidity in 2020 as China gradually moves
to full currency convertibility and opens yuan-denominated A
shares to foreign investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. 
&#8220;As a financial centre, we expect Shanghai to develop more
along the lines of the New York model -- that is, primarily
dedicated to its domestic market -- rather than as a regional
financial centre like London or Singapore,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
analysts Christopher Eoyang, Jason Lui and Sunil Koul said in a
research report released today. &#8220;In many ways, we think
Shanghai may partially emulate the development of Hong Kong
during the 1980s and 1990s, when manufacturing was gradually
replaced by higher value added services.&#8221; 
Shanghai currently accounts for 25 percent of the region&#8217;s
daily cash equity and futures turnover, the analysts wrote. The
city will benefit &#8220;disproportionately&#8221; as China&#8217;s financial
markets grow deeper and more sophisticated, they said. 
China&#8217;s central government has a goal of making Shanghai an
international financial center by 2020. The city&#8217;s economy,
which already surpassed Hong Kong&#8217;s in size last year, grew 8.2
percent in 2009. In comparison, New York City&#8217;s expanded 0.9
percent in the fourth quarter after seven straight quarterly
declines. 
Daily Trading 
The Goldman Sachs report comes after the People&#8217;s Bank of
China pledged June 19 to make its currency more flexible, a move
that drove the yuan up by the most since July 2005. The Shanghai
Composite Index climbed 2.9 percent yesterday. U.S. President
Barack Obama said the policy action will &#8220;contribute to a more
balanced global economy.&#8221; 
Goldman forecast that with a gradual liberalization, the
value of equities and futures traded daily in China could reach
$455 billion in 2020, about 70 percent of the regional total, up
from the current $58 billion, or 36 percent of the liquidity in
Asia, according to the report. 
Under the same scenario, trading turnover in Shanghai could
increase to more than $350 billion per day in a decade from the
current $47 billion, Goldman Sachs estimated. That means
Shanghai would account for more than 75 percent of China&#8217;s
liquidity, and as much as 53 percent of Asia&#8217;s, they said. 
&#8220;Despite Shanghai&#8217;s image as a modern commercial centre
and its notable achievements, China&#8217;s equity capital markets are
relatively immature,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &#8220;Although
the government is on the path towards full currency
convertibility and the opening up of the domestic equity market,
the process will probably be very gradual, and this could
potentially benefit Hong Kong.&#8221; 
Ownership of yuan-denominated or A-shares is limited to
Chinese citizens and approved overseas investors under the
qualified foreign institutional investor, or QFII, program. The
analysts estimated current foreign ownership of A shares at
about 0.5 percent of market capitalization, compared to 25
percent in Japan and about 30 percent in Korea and Taiwan.

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said it suspended trials of its experimental pain
relief drug, tanezumab, for osteoarthritis after reports that
patients&#8217; conditions worsened and led to joint replacements. 
Pfizer, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, isn&#8217;t recruiting any new patients or giving the
drug to patients already in 10 osteoarthritis trials or those
with the condition taking the drug in studies for other
diseases, the New York-based company said today in a statement. 
Tanezumab would generate an estimated $100 million in
annual sales by the end of 2012, and $260 million by 2013,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The drug was one of
500 projects the company had preserved in a pared-down
development portfolio. Pfizer said in April 2009 that the drug
as a treatment for the pain of osteoarthritis in the knee had
moved into the third and final stage of testing usually needed
for regulatory approval. 
The FDA asked the company to show data on potential effects
in clinical studies of the drug among patients with cancer pain,
interstitial cystitis, chronic low back pain and painful
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Pfizer said. 
The agency will then decide whether to halt Pfizer&#8217;s
remaining trials of tanezumab after reviewing company data.
Trials for other conditions haven&#8217;t reported similar adverse
events, MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. 





Trials of the Pfizer drug Tanezumab have led to joint replacement. Close

General Motors Co. is preparing for
an initial public offering that may sell 20 percent of the
Treasury&#8217;s stake in the automaker and reduce the U.S. to a
minority owner, said two people familiar with the plan. 
The aim is to sell a fifth of the government&#8217;s 304 million
shares, said the people, who asked not to be identified
revealing private discussions. That would reduce the Treasury
Department&#8217;s stake to less than 50 percent from 61 percent now.
Final decisions on which owners will sell how many shares
haven&#8217;t been made and may change, the people said. 
A registration statement may be filed in August, aiming for
a November stock sale, said four people familiar with the plan.
The sale will probably raise $10 billion to $15 billion,
depending on the company&#8217;s performance, the strength of the
economy and the health of the IPO market, the people said. 
An August filing means Detroit-based GM could have the IPO
ready around the time of the Nov. 2 congressional elections,
said the people. If Treasury can sell enough shares, President
Barack Obama could help other Democrats running for office by
arguing that his administration&#8217;s restructuring of GM is paying
off, said Joe Phillippi, president of AutoTrends Consulting. 
&#8220;The government wants a successful offering soon so they
can say that they took the company through bankruptcy, turned it
over to independent management and are taking it public,&#8221; said
Phillippi, who is based in Short Hills, New Jersey. &#8220;This would
be part of the campaign spin.&#8221; 
Other Sellers 
The automaker may also issue new shares to raise cash and
sell shares owned by Canada and a union-led retiree health-care
trust, one of the people said. 
Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined in an e-mail to
comment on the matter. 
GM has invited analysts, potential investors and
representatives of its current shareholders to Detroit for a
review of the business on June 29, said a spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem. GM will also give the members of the financial
community a look at current and future models, she said. 
The IPO will be managed by JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley, people familiar with the matter have said. They will
collect fees of 0.75 percent of the sale, said a person briefed
on the matter. Such fees would be a quarter of the usual rate
for large stock sales. 
JPMorgan had offered to accept payment in equity instead of
cash, though that idea was rejected by GM and Treasury, two
people said. 
The U.S. will probably sell the remainder of its GM stock
over &#8220;a few years,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said
in a May 17 Bloomberg Television interview. 
Equity Value 
GM&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s bond prices, GM&#8217;s
equity is worth about $51 billion. 
Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group&#8217;s
$10.6 billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.&#8217;s $8.68 billion
deal in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.&#8217;s $5.47 billion sale
in 1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The size of a company&#8217;s IPO may vary from the original
amount listed in its registration statement, known as an S-1
filing, submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission. 
The SEC examines the S-1, which companies use to register
shares they want to sell, to make sure it complies with
disclosure requirements and may ask for amendments to correct or
clarify statements. A company can sell shares once the SEC
declares the registration statement effective. 
The process usually takes 8 to 10 weeks from the time of
the initial S-1 filing to the effective date.

Britain&#8217;s new bank levy will have a
&#8220;minimal&#8221; impact on U.S. investment banks with operations in
London, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. likely to pay only a sixth
of the bill it faces for the bonus tax. 
International banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. may pay about a quarter of the 2 billion-pound ($3
billion) total levy a year, according to analysts at Seymour
Pierce Ltd. and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit
today. The U.K.&#8217;s five biggest banks will pay about 76 percent
of the Treasury forecast for the bank tax, according to Mark Phin, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Ltd. 
&#8220;The impact will be minimal for U.S. investment banks,&#8221;
said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London
with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on New York-based Goldman
Sachs. &#8220;It could impact Goldman by about $100 million per year,
or about 1 percent of earnings. That assumes the industry in
general doesn&#8217;t pass on the cost to customers.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in U.S.
history, has said the U.K.&#8217;s one-time bonus tax will leave it
with a $600 million bill. In December, the U.K. put a one-time
50 percent levy on bankers&#8217; discretionary bonuses. 
Spokeswomen for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in London
declined to comment on the bank levy today. 
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told lawmakers
yesterday the tax will raise about 2 billion pounds annually as
other European governments consider similar taxes to tackle
budget deficits inflated by bank bailouts. The 0.07 percent levy
on wholesale liabilities is less than half the 0.15 percent rate
being considered by the U.S. government. 
The six biggest U.K. banks will pay about 1.5 billion
pounds of the 2 billion pounds forecast, with the remaining 500
million pounds coming from building societies and foreign banks,
Bank of America said today in a note to clients.

Three of the five U.S. banks that
dominate swaps trading already perform most transactions outside
their depository institutions and would face minimal disruption
from a congressional proposal to reorder the derivatives
business, financial statements and banking records show. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. would be hit
hardest by the proposal, crafted by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to wall off swaps desks from commercial banks. JPMorgan
had 98 percent of its $142 billion in current value derivatives
holdings inside its bank in the first quarter of this year while
Citigroup had 89 percent of $112 billion, the records show. 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., each of which
entered the commercial banking business in 2008 in the midst of
the financial crisis, would be less affected. Morgan Stanley
kept just over 1 percent of its $86 billion in derivatives
holdings in its bank in the first quarter, and Goldman Sachs
Group&#8217;s held 32 percent of its $104 billion. Bank of America
Corp., which absorbed broker-dealer Merrill Lynch in 2009, had
33 percent of its $115 billion in its bank. 
Lincoln, a Democrat, contends the swaps-desk measure would
reduce taxpayers&#8217; exposure to risky banking activities. The
banking industry has been lobbying against the idea for weeks,
saying it would drive up costs and send business to foreign
lenders. The trading numbers call into question the extent of
the impact and whether the congressional action would favor one
business model over another. While JPMorgan and Citigroup might
have to spend billions to re-capitalize their trading desks, the
three others might have much smaller costs. 
&#8216;Pick and Choose&#8217; 
&#8220;Any time that Congress tries to pick and choose what
parts of the genie to put back in the bottle, we&#8217;re going to be
creating some pretty strange creatures,&#8221; said Bill Brown, a
Duke University law professor and former global co-head of
listed derivatives at Morgan Stanley. 
JPMorgan has the vast majority of swaps trades in its bank,
though the percentage may be inflated due to the double counting
of a small amount of transactions in other parts of the its
businesses, according to a person familiar with the company&#8217;s
derivatives operations. 
Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America
and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. 
$615 Trillion 
The swaps-desk provision is the most contentious of a
larger set of rules aimed at reducing risk in the system by
imposing for the first time a regulatory structure for the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. The changes would
also require standardized derivatives trades to be cleared
through a third party and traded on an exchange or so-called
swap-execution facility and would regulate the foreign-exchange
swaps market. 
A committee of lawmakers reconciling the House and Senate
versions of financial-regulatory reform is scheduled to take up
derivatives language tomorrow. Lawmakers said they have left it
for the end of the debate because of its complexity. 
The swaps-desk measure introduced in April by Lincoln, who
is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cleared
several hurdles in the legislative process while being
criticized by the banking industry, the administration of
President Barack Obama, the Federal Reserve and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. Last week, seven U.S. regional lenders,
including U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks Inc., came out against
the measure. 
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who
is leading the House negotiations, said in May that he thought
the Lincoln provision &#8220;goes too far.&#8221; He has changed his
stance recently, telling reporters yesterday that &#8220;the
essence&#8221; of the Lincoln proposal would be in the final
legislation. 
&#8220;Certainly they will be totally insulated from any insured
deposits,&#8221; Frank said. 
Volcker 
Last month Frank raised the idea that one way to achieve
Lincoln&#8217;s goals without unintended consequences could be to
expand the scope of another proposal in the bill -- the so-
called Volcker rule, a ban on proprietary trading by banks. That
notion has failed to gain traction in the talks, because the
majority of the swaps trading by the banks is executed for other
customers and might not be covered by a prohibition on banks&#8217;
trading for their own accounts. 
Negotiations have been continuing on possible exemptions
for banks to the Lincoln proposal for certain types of customer-
driven derivatives products. Frank said yesterday Lincoln has
pushed back against those, including an exemption for desks that
serve as market-makers. 
&#8220;Senator Lincoln wants that to go outside&#8221; the depository
institution, Frank said. &#8220;And I think she&#8217;s going to win that
one.&#8221; 
Lucrative Business 
Selling over-the-counter derivatives is among the most
lucrative businesses for the largest financial companies. U.S.
commercial banks held derivatives with a notional value of
$212.8 trillion in the fourth quarter, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of
America, Goldman and Morgan Stanley hold 97 percent of that
total. 
The calculation of derivatives holdings for the five
largest banks is based on a Bloomberg News analysis of the
financial records of the bank holding companies and their
subsidiaries, as well as records filed with federal banking
regulators and posted publicly by the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council. 
Swaps and other derivatives are financial instruments based
on the value of another security or benchmark. Some instruments,
including contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have
been blamed for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst
recession since the Great Depression. 
Fed Lending 
Lincoln and her supporters argue that separating swaps
trading from commercial banking would protect depositors and
other small customers from potentially risky trading that could
bring down a firm. They also say it would prevent bailouts by
denying swaps traders the assistance that the government gives
to banks, such as access to emergency lending from the Fed or
deposit insurance from the FDIC. 
&#8220;We view this as an essential component of making the
system sound so that we can get back to where banks are lending
to businesses that are growing and creating jobs,&#8221; said Heather
Slavkin, a senior legal and policy adviser at the AFL-CIO.
&#8220;When banks use their resources to gamble in the derivatives
markets, they have less capital to invest in businesses that
will create good jobs for working people and grow the middle
class.&#8221; 
Substantial Cost 
Analysts from Citigroup last week wrote that longtime
commercial banks would bear the brunt of the rule, noting that
they would have to give up the benefit of funding their
derivatives deals with funds from deposits. The June 16 report
concluded that while it is &#8220;very difficult&#8221; to determine how
much it would cost to capitalize a free-standing swaps desk, the
price tag is likely to be &#8220;substantial.&#8221; 
&#8220;It all comes down to the cost of funding and it&#8217;s always
easier inside the bank where the credit rating is going to be
higher, the source of funding is more stable and it&#8217;s cheaper,&#8221;
said Brian Gardner, an analyst at investment firm Keefe Bruyette
 Woods. &#8220;Can you do it in a broker-dealer? Yep. People have
done it before and if they have to, they&#8217;ll do it again.&#8221; 
Short-Term Disadvantage 
While the swaps-desk rule, if adopted, would put JPMorgan
and Citigroup at a short-term disadvantage with their
competitors, the big dealers have been arguing on Capitol Hill
that the bigger concern is that U.S. banks will be put at a
competitive disadvantage with foreign counterparts. Large
dealers such as Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays
Plc, would be even less affected by the requirement, analysts
said. 
Neither the European Union nor Asian countries are looking
at requiring banks to wall off their derivatives trading as part
of their responses to the credit crisis. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m getting a lot of calls, hearing from a lot from folks
who do this for a living and they really think this is going to
drive the business away from U.S. banks,&#8221; Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said in an interview.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, agreed to pay $102 million to settle claims
by Massachusetts that the firm financed and securitized unfair
residential loans, state Attorney General Martha Coakley said. 
Of the $102 million, $58 million will be earmarked for more
than 1,000 Massachusetts homeowners, with other funds set aside
for the Massachusetts Pension Fund for investment losses and the
commonwealth&#8217;s general fund, Coakley said today at a press
conference in Boston. 
&#8220;This has become an all-too-familiar pattern in which the
deceptive practices of Wall Street devastated homeowners and
investors, and ultimately contributed to the collapse of our
economy,&#8221; Coakley said. &#8220;Our extensive investigation revealed
that Morgan Stanley not only backed loans for homeowners that
they should have known were destined to fail, they also caused
additional damage in the subprime marketplace.&#8221; 
The bank is barred from making unfair loans and will be
required to make additional disclosures going forward, Coakley
said. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is pleased to resolve this matter in a way
that will help many Massachusetts homeowners stay in their
homes,&#8221; Jennifer Sala, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, said in an e-mailed statement. 
New Century 
Coakley claimed Morgan Stanley provided billions of dollars
to subprime lender New Century, which used those funds to target
low-income borrowers and lure them into loans that consumers
predictably couldn&#8217;t afford to pay. The loans often were
unsustainable, though they were profitable for the lenders, she
said. 
The settlement fund for Massachusetts homeowners will be
overseen by an independent trustee, according to settlement
papers filed in Massachusetts state court. 
The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. The Massachusetts attorney general reached a $60 million
settlement last year with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Morgan Stanley fell 77 cents, or 3 percent, to $24.26 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, sued a former
technology services manager to keep her from working at Oracle
Corp., saying the new position violates a non-compete clause. 
Joanne Olsen, a 31-year veteran of IBM, left the company
this month to become a senior vice president at Oracle,
according to the suit, filed June 16. As a general manager in
IBM&#8217;s technology services division, Olsen knew about IBM&#8217;s
growth strategies and potential acquisitions, the company said. 
&#8220;As a long time general manager in our services business
and as a member of the company&#8217;s leadership team, Joanne Olsen
possesses valuable confidential information about IBM and our
operations,&#8221; IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said today in an e-
mailed statement. 
IBM trails only Oracle and Microsoft Corp. in software
sales. Oracle bought Sun Microsystems Inc. in January for $7.4
billion to enter the server-computer market, where they&#8217;ll also
compete with IBM. 
Olsen signed a non-compete clause in July 2009, stating she
can&#8217;t join a competitor for a year after leaving, according to
the suit. At Oracle, she would become senior vice president of
on-demand services, managing the delivery of its applications
and reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison,
it said. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $1.92, or 1.48
percent, to $128.19 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
today. The shares were little changed this year before today. 
The suit comes one year after IBM tried to keep David Johnson, its former head of mergers and acquisitions, from
joining Dell Inc., another server-computer rival. A judge
dismissed the case, saying Johnson didn&#8217;t have knowledge that
would qualify as &#8220;quintessential trade-secret information.&#8221; 
Olsen&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Delikat, of Orrick Herrington 
Sutcliffe, couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. Oracle spokeswoman
Deborah Hellinger also didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment.

"The Odds Are Increasing That Microsoft's Business Will Collapse"

That's a pretty good title if you (like Henry Blodget from Silicon Alley Insider, the writer of the article) are trying to grab eyeballs. It also provides a useful introduction to what I call the "Innovator's Paradox."

Blodget's article was provocative. He argued that Microsoft is in a no-win situation. It isn't sitting on any idea that is on the cusp of turning into a multi-billion dollar business. The personal computer is losing its dominance to mobile devices and tablets. The company's core profit drivers (Windows and Office) are under disruptive assault from Google's freely available applications and operating system. At best, Microsoft will respond with its own free products and erode its profit margin.

The most telling thing in Blodget's post was a chart that showed the sources of Microsoft's profits over the past few years. Microsoft's core business has continued &#8212; despite continued proclamations of the company's coming demise &#8212; to throw off cash and to grow. But new growth businesses that were specks in 2006 (entertainment and devices and online services) remain tiny, and Microsoft hasn't created any material new businesses over the past few years.

So the real problem isn't what Microsoft is doing today. It's what Microsoft did, or didn't do, five, or even 10 years ago. At the time, its base business was a bastion of strength. Today's threats were in their infancies. It would have been the perfect time to plant seeds that today would be blooming profit generators. 

Why didn't it? It's The Innovator's Paradox: When you don't need the growth, you act in ways that lead to you not getting the growth you will need. And when you do need the growth, you can't act in ways that deliver it.

Got that?

I use this chart to illustrate this point. It's helpful to stimulate discussion among a company's leadership team.

As the chart shows, when times are going great ("exploitation"), companies have ample resources to invest in growth. But because times are going great, innovation efforts tend to be undisciplined. New growth efforts get flooded with cash. Companies don't worry about iterating to find a successful business model. Overpriced acquisitions occur.
Then, inevitably, maturation sets in. The need for new growth intensifies. But resources are harder to come by. Acquisition targets would rather join forces with the new kid on the block whose rapidly appreciating stock acts as a powerful acquisition currency. The acute need for growth gives an almost gravitational pull to large, existing markets. After all, that's where the money is. But large, existing markets are an innovator's fool's gold; glimmery, shiny, but not of much value.

So what do you do about the Innovator's Paradox? Consider what my colleague Clark Gilbert found in his doctoral research. He looked at how newspaper companies responded to the Internet, intersecting the disruptive innovation research of Clayton Christensen and the famous behavioral research of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

Some companies in Gilbert's study viewed the Internet as a threat. That led to them committing resources to innovation efforts. However, they responded in very rigid ways (typically creating replicas of the newspapers online). Other companies viewed the Internet as an opportunity. That framing allowed for more expansive response strategies, but made it difficult to support serious resource allocation. Gilbert summarized this challenge by saying, "Absent a sense of threat, response to disruptive opportunities is inadequate; but with threat, the fully funded response is too rigid."

The trick, Gilbert argued, was to decouple the allocation of resources from the use of the resources. Breaking the Innovator's Paradox requires similar logic. Companies have to recognize that their core business, no matter how great it seems today, has a limit. That recognition should drive consistent allocation of resources to new growth efforts, especially when times are good. But those resources can't be burdened with a "bunker" mentality, or else they will struggle. As one friend told me, "No great growth business was built from a defensive crouch." Further, companies have to make sure they avoid the "curse of abundance" that can lead overly resourced growth efforts to struggle.

So, all you have to do is invest when you don't need to, break psychological barriers that might unintentionally inhibit creativity, and somehow avoid the abundant resources that would seem to be your primary source of competitive advantage. 

No one said this was going to be easy.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley led bank stocks lower, and bearish option trades jumped,
on concern that financial-reform legislation due to be completed
as soon as today may reduce Wall Street revenue. 
The SP 500 Financials Index, which includes 79 financial
firms, dropped as much as 2.2 percent as JPMorgan and Wells
Fargo  Co. fell as much as 3.8 percent. Morgan Stanley dropped
as low as $24.22, its lowest intraday level since May 2009.
Trading of puts to sell the Financial Select Sector SPDR
exchange-traded fund was 2.6 times the four-week average. 
Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are
negotiating the final language of legislation that may limit
banks&#8217; trading in over-the-counter derivatives as well as how
they invest their own capital. Some analysts say the proposed
laws have become tougher in recent weeks. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s starting to really cross over, quite clearly, not
into the area of financial regulatory reform but into punishment
of Wall Street,&#8221; Brian Gardner, a former congressional staffer
who is now a Washington analyst for Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Inc., said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television.
&#8220;It&#8217;s become a net negative.&#8221; 
The House and Senate conferees are debating a ban on
proprietary trading, nicknamed the Volcker rule after former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as well as a provision
championed by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln that would
require commercial banks to push out their swaps-trading
operations. 
Analysts Cut Estimates 
The legislation comes as analysts reduce their forecasts
for bank and securities firm earnings in the second quarter
because of a reduction in investment banking and deterioration
in markets in May and June. Barclays Capital analysts slashed
their estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s second-quarter
earnings per share 63 percent yesterday to $1.95 from an earlier
forecast of $5.35. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s so much uncertainty around it and that&#8217;s why
people are scared,&#8221; said Kevin Nichols, vice president for ETF
strategy at Newedge Group in New York. &#8220;It also has to do with
regulators coming in to an industry that&#8217;s facing a lot of other
headwinds like slower investment banking business, analysts
cutting projections and lower volumes in equities.&#8221; 
The SP 500 Financials Index was down 1.95 percent as of
11:42 a.m. and JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
dropped $1.16, or 2.98 percent, to $37.73. 
Almost 485,000 puts to sell the financial ETF changed
hands, 18 times the number of calls giving the right to buy. The
ETF tracking 79 companies fell 1.7 percent to $14.27 as all but
two members retreated. 
The most active contracts were August $13 puts, which rose
37 percent to 37 cents and accounted for almost a third of all
options trading. The ETF hasn&#8217;t closed below $13 since July.

Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the two largest U.S. banks, drove a measure of
financial stocks to the biggest daily gain in a month after
Congress agreed to ease proposed curbs on trading and investing. 
Bank of America and JPMorgan each rose more than 3 percent,
in line with a 3.1 percent advance in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
Diversified Financials Index, as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell. It was the financial index&#8217;s largest one-day
increase since May 27. 
&#8220;The market is sort of celebrating the fact that the
largest banks&#8217; operations are largely left intact,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, founder of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey, who
covers JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  Co. Even so,
future expansion of the biggest banks may be limited, she said. 
The so-called Volcker rule to ban banks from investing in
hedge funds and private equity was &#8220;watered down a bit,&#8221;
allowing lenders to invest as much as 3 percent of their
capital, Deutsche Bank analysts Matt O&#8217;Connor and Michael Carrier said in a note to clients. 
A ban on derivative-trading by commercial banks proposed by
Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas was amended to allow trades
on interest rates and foreign-exchange swaps, which made up
about 92 percent of their total notional trading volume in the
first quarter. Banks will have as many as two years to comply. 
&#8220;What Senator Lincoln wanted to do didn&#8217;t come to pass and
that&#8217;s a major win for the big banks,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets. 
20-Hour Session 
Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, rose
2.7 percent to $15.42. JPMorgan, based in New York, advanced 3.7
percent to $39.44. 
Lawmakers from the House and Senate worked through the
night in a 20-hour session to reach deals on a ban on
proprietary trading by banks and oversight of the derivatives
market. The legislation, which also seeks to protect consumers
from abusive lending practices, still needs to be approved by
the full House and Senate. Congressional leaders aim to hold
votes next week and send it for Obama&#8217;s signature by July 4. 
Obama today praised lawmakers for agreeing on what he
called the &#8220;toughest&#8221; consumer reforms in history. 
The bill is &#8220;not as bad as it looks,&#8221; FBR Capital Markets
analyst Paul Miller wrote in a report. &#8220;The conference
committee avoided adopting the worst-case scenario.&#8221; 
For example, congressional negotiators removed language
that would have required banks to act as a fiduciary when
selling derivatives to states, municipalities and pension funds,
Miller said. Instead, a code of conduct was adopted.

Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s first candidate
treatment for diabetes improved blood sugar control and helped
patients lose weight, a study showed. 
The 12-week study of patients who were also taking the
generic drug metformin found the lowest dose of JJ&#8217;s
canagliflozin reduced blood sugar 0.8 percent, and the highest
dose lowered blood sugar 0.9 percent. Patients in the trial who
were given Merck  Co.&#8217;s Januvia instead had reductions of 0.7
percent. The JJ-funded study didn&#8217;t have enough patients to
compare which treatment was better, the company said in a
statement. 
JJ, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, is testing
canagliflozin as its first drug for diabetes that will compete
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s dapagliflozin, which also had
data reported today. JJ&#8217;s Lifescan unit makes blood glucose
meters, allowing diabetic patients to see if their blood sugar
is too high, and had revenue of $2.4 billion last year. The
company has started enrolling patients for its final-stage
studies of the drug for diabetes. 
&#8220;It helps that people understand they&#8217;ve already committed
to the space,&#8221; said Michael G. King, an analyst for Wedbush
Morgan Securities, in a June 25 interview &#8220;The question is,
&#8216;Why doesn&#8217;t JJ have an insulin and a GPL-1?&#8221; said King,
referring to another category of drugs that includes Byetta from
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co. and Victoza from Denmark-
based Novo Nordisk A/S. 
Diabetes Meeting 
Results were presented today at the American Diabetes
Association&#8217;s annual meeting in Orlando, Florida. 
Canagliflozin works by letting the body excrete more
glucose through the urine. The kidneys have a kind of built-in
thermostat; any rise above a certain amount of blood sugar
triggers a response that sends the excess into the urine.
Canagliflozin lowers the temperature on the thermostat, so more
sugar goes into the urine, while allowing enough blood sugar to
continue circulating to avoid hypoglycemia, said Kirk Ways, the
head of canagliflozin development at the company. 
Patients taking canagliflozin decreased their weight by 2.3
to 3.4 percent. Patients taking placebo and metformin had 1.1
percent weight loss, and those on Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based Merck&#8217;s Januvia dropped 0.6 percent. 
New York-based Bristol-Myers and London-based AstraZeneca
Plc make another experimental drug, dapagliflozin, which works
the same way. Results from a phase 3 trial also announced today
showed that dapagliflozin, in combination with insulin, worked
better than insulin plus a placebo. 
Blood Sugar Levels 
The 800-person study showed reductions of 0.75 percent in
blood sugar for the lowest dose and 0.90 percent for the highest
dose of the Bristol-Myers drug. Patients who got a placebo and
insulin had declines of 0.3 percent. 
Additionally, patients who took dapagliflozin and insulin
lost weight while patients only on insulin gained weight. Taking
dapagliflozin allowed patients to lower their insulin dose. 
If dapagliflozin launches first, it will probably get more
of the market share, said Les Funtleyder, an analyst for Miller
Tabak  Co. 
&#8220;Johnson  Johnson has a lot going in its favor, but they
have to get through Bristol,&#8221; Funtleyder said in a June 23
telephone interview. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s room for two.&#8221; 
Today&#8217;s data are part of a push by JJ into diabetes
treatment. On June 22, the company entered into an agreement
worth as much as $330 million with privately held Metabolex
Inc., based in Hayward, California, to develop diabetes drugs.
The same day, Diamyd Medical AB announced it would partner with
JJ on a drug for Type 1 diabetes, worth as much as $625 million
for the Stockholm, Sweden-based company. The drug is in the
final stage of development. 
&#8220;Johnson  Johnson would like a more holistic approach,
through nutritionals, devices, surgical techniques, and having a
drug that would treat Type 2 diabetes, and offers added benefits
over other drugs,&#8221; said JJ&#8217;s Ways. 
Canagliflozin has &#8220;potential to be a blockbuster,&#8221;
Funtleyder said.

The Bank of Canada named Goldman
Sachs Canada Chief Executive Officer Timothy Hodgson as a
special adviser to Governor Mark Carney, who also worked at the
investment bank. 
Hodgson will work on developing rules for trading repos and
over-the-counter derivatives, and regulations to ensure banks
have enough capital, the Ottawa-based central bank said in a
statement today. A repo is a short-term contract to sell and
repurchase a security, and derivatives are securities whose
value depends on the value of another asset, such as crude oil. 
&#8220;The bank is privileged that someone of his experience has
chosen public service at this critical time,&#8221; Carney said in a
statement. Carney and Hodgson worked together at Goldman Sachs
in New York from 1998-2000, Bank of Canada spokesman Jeremy Harrison said. 
Canada and other Group of 20 nations are crafting rules to
have derivatives traded more through clearinghouses with
standardized contracts, Carney said in a June 10 speech in
Montreal. The global credit crisis was caused in part by
questions about the solvency of banks that led to the breakdown
of trading in important financial markets, he said in Montreal. 
Carney earlier today was named to lead a group at the Bank
for International Settlements that monitors global financial
markets. 
Ivey Graduate 
Hodgson will work for an 18-month term in Toronto starting
Sept. 1. He will serve on bank committees that review
developments affecting monetary policy and the health of the
financial system. 
Hodgson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and has a Master of
Business Administration degree from the Ivey School of Business
at the University of Western Ontario. He has served as the head
of Goldman&#8217;s Canadian unit since 2005, and joined the firm in
1990. 
Jack Curtin will replace Hodgson at Goldman Sachs on July
1, the New York-based company said today in a staff memo. Curtin
was chief executive of the bank&#8217;s Canadian unit from 1995 to
2000, and became chairman in 2002. He joined the firm in 1976
and is based in Toronto.

General Motors Co., preparing for an
initial public offering as soon as the fourth quarter, said U.S.
consumers are paying more per vehicle than last year. 
Customers in the U.S. are paying $3,000 more on average for
GM&#8217;s cars and trucks, Mark Reuss, president of GM North America,
said today in a conference call as part of a daylong
presentation to analysts and potential investors. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre and other
top executives gave a review of Detroit-based GM&#8217;s current
business operations, including restructuring in Europe, growth
in other markets and 85 percent capacity utilization in North
America. The U.S., which holds 61 percent of the automaker, may
sell 20 percent of its stake in the IPO, making it a minority
owner, said two people familiar with the plan. 
&#8220;We are not re-introducing GM,&#8221; Whitacre told the
audience at the automaker&#8217;s technical center in Warren,
Michigan. &#8220;We are introducing a new GM.&#8221; 
Chevrolet has 94 percent of the Uzbekistan market, said Tim Lee, GM&#8217;s president of international operations. The automaker
also plans to grow &#8220;significantly&#8221; in South Korea, he said. 
GM is now positioned to break even during troughs in
demand, Whitacre said. The management team is executing well, he
said. 
Equity Value 
The automaker&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a
May 20 report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. debt analyst
who projects a return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of
bonds issued by GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that
will be converted to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s
bond prices, GM&#8217;s equity is worth about $47 billion. 
GM, the maker of the GMC Terrain, Cadillac SRX and
Chevrolet Camaro, reported first-quarter net income of $865
million, helped by higher production and smaller discounts.
Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell on May 17 called the
profit a &#8220;good, useful step&#8221; toward an IPO. 
The company&#8217;s first-quarter operating profit was $1.2
billion in the first three months of the year, and the company
generated $1 billion in free cash flow, GM said. Revenue rose 40
percent from the same period a year earlier to $31.5 billion. 
GM&#8217;s Opel and Vauxhall operations in Europe lost $506
million in the first quarter. GM is restructuring the business
with plans to take out 20 percent of its production capacity and
cut 8,300 jobs. 
Changing Culture 
GM is changing its culture by cutting the bureaucracy that
made the company so slow, said Vice Chairman Steve Girsky. His
industry-analysis group used to prepare 94 reports a month, he
said, and now it does three. 
The company also has been moving executives to other
operations within the company to bring different perspectives,
he said. 
&#8220;That allows people to ask the basic stupid question that
hasn&#8217;t been asked for 30 years,&#8221; Girsky said. 
Board members thought that managers had too many direct
reports, with some exceeding 20, Girsky said. 
&#8220;Someone with 15 is pretty hard to find&#8221; now, he said. 
GM has the opportunity to increase annual sales by about
2.6 million vehicles by 2014 if GM holds its market share in key
regions, Liddell said. He cited a forecast from Lexington,
Massachusetts-based research firm IHS Automotive that calls for
annual global auto sales to grow by 25 million vehicles by 2014. 
GM has a &#8220;massive global opportunity if we are successful
maintaining market share,&#8221; Liddell said. 
Reducing Debt 
The automaker also needs to reduce its debt, Liddell said.
Debt, preferred shares held by the U.S. Treasury and underfunded
pension plans total $42.2 billion while GM has $30 billion in
cash, he showed in a slide presentation. 
GM&#8217;s pension plans are underfunded by $26.8 billion, GM
said. It doesn&#8217;t have to put any cash in now, Liddell said. 
The company will probably have to put cash into the pension
fund, while investments could take care of some of the
shortfall, Liddell said. 
&#8220;The pension plan is a huge continuing liability,&#8221;
Liddell said. &#8220;Almost certainly we will have to put cash in at
some stage. Once fully funded, we&#8217;ll change the investment
strategy to lock in.&#8221; 
GM will most likely rely on outside lenders to finance the
sale of cars to consumers and dealers, Liddell said. Banks and
other financial institutions have better access to cheap funds
than GM, which doesn&#8217;t have investment-grade credit, he said. 
Rather than saddle GM&#8217;s balance sheet with banking assets,
the company will find lenders to handle different types of
loans. GM has AmeriCredit Corp. handling subprime lending and
U.S. Bank for leasing and Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC
LLC, handling the bulk of dealer financing and car loans to
consumers.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been
more responsive to information requests from the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission since being subpoenaed and has made
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein available for an
interview, the panel&#8217;s leaders said. 
Blankfein was interviewed recently by FCIC staff &#8220;at
length,&#8221; commission Chairman Phil Angelides said today in a
conference call with journalists. Angelides said on June 7 that
the panel had subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the commission with documents. 
&#8220;I have no question&#8221; that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas
said today on the call. &#8220;It was the lack of specificity, or
even the acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles
of documents we got, that was cleared up.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar will testify at a two-day FCIC hearing beginning
tomorrow reviewing the role of derivatives in the recession.
Also scheduled to testify is Joseph Cassano, the former American
International Group Inc. executive whose bets on subprime
mortgages led the insurer to the brink of collapse in 2008,
requiring a U.S. bailout. 
&#8220;This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you&#8217;d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset,&#8221; Thomas said. 
$12.9 Billion 
After AIG&#8217;s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. 
AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including Goldman
Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG protecting them
against declines in the value of mortgages. When the housing
market collapsed, AIG didn&#8217;t have enough funds to honor its
contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that swelled to
$182.3 billion. Cassano was interviewed for about five hours. 
Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren&#8217;t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. 
Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. 
Credit-Default Swaps 
The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. 
Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

Walt Disney Co. opened its first
redesigned store in Montebello, California, today as part of a
six-year plan to make its 350 retail outlets worldwide more
entertaining for shoppers. 
The media company will open revamped locations 20 in the
U.S. and Europe by November, the start of the holiday shopping
season, Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said
in an interview. 
Disney has consolidated its retail business after taking
back control over U.S. and Japan operations. The new stores will
let customers build characters from Disney&#8217;s Pixar Studio movie
&#8220;Cars,&#8221; interact with a magic mirror and watch clips from film
and TV shows in a movie theater with a 12-foot (3.6-meter)
screen. 
&#8220;Today in retail you have to be a special destination or
very, very price conscious,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going for
special.&#8221; 
Disney will next open revamped stores in Madrid, then in
Portugal and Italy, before an outlet at Roosevelt Field mall in
Garden City, New York, at the end of July, Fielding said. A
store in Santa Monica, California, is slated for Aug. 8. 
The Montebello store features 13-foot plastic trees on
which Disney videos are projected. The goal is to keep shoppers
entertained in the store for 30 minutes, Fielding said. 
Disney, which owns movie studios, theme parks and the ABC
and ESPN television networks, got about 6.7 percent of its $36
billion in revenue last fiscal year from the consumer-products
unit, which includes retail stores, according to Bloomberg data. 
Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 92 cents to
$32.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares are little changed this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Richard Berliand, who helped combine Bear Stearns Cos.&#8217;s prime brokerage
unit into the firm, is retiring after 23 years at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets. 
Berliand will be replaced by Sandie O&#8217;Connor, JPMorgan&#8217;s
global head of financing and market products, who has also spent
more than two decades at the company, according to a memo sent
to employees today from Carlos Hernandez, JPMorgan&#8217;s global head
of equities. 
&#8220;Richard&#8217;s deep understanding of our markets businesses
and the regulatory environment has enhanced our ability to stay
ahead of the changes occurring in our industry,&#8221; Hernandez
wrote. The memo was confirmed by spokesman Brian Marchiony.
Financial News reported the move earlier today. 
Berliand ran several global divisions during his career at
New York-based JPMorgan, overseeing cash equities, futures and
options. As the global head of prime services, he oversaw the
bank&#8217;s prime brokerage, futures and options as well as
derivatives-clearing operations. Berliand, who wants to spend
more time with his family, will stay for a month while O&#8217;Connor
transitions to her new role, Hernandez said. 
O&#8217;Connor will work with the global equities group to expand
JPMorgan&#8217;s prime services business in Europe, the Middle East
and Asia, Hernandez said. She will also continue her role
overseeing JPMorgan&#8217;s prime custody solutions group, which acts
as a custodian for hedge funds and other large institutional
investors. 
She previously oversaw global securities lending, clearing,
collateral management, foreign exchange, depository receipts and
execution services. 
Jeremy Barnum, 38, a managing director in the bank&#8217;s global
fixed-income group, will take over Berliand&#8217;s duties chairing
the firm&#8217;s market-structure group, which evaluates regulatory
and market changes. Barnum will also continue in his current
role reporting to Daniel Pinto, the co-head of fixed-income
products, Hernandez said.

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc may consider bidding for BP Plc after the London-based
oil company lost more than half of its market value in the wake
of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. said. 
Exxon Mobil has the stronger balance sheet and proven
ability to integrate a large transaction, according to Fred Lucas, a London-based analyst at JP Morgan. It could make a cash
and share offer, valuing BP at 473 pence a share compared with
yesterday&#8217;s close of 308.25 pence, and including a $50 billion
spin-off of BP&#8217;s downstream assets, according to JPMorgan. 
BP&#8217;s market value has collapsed by more than $100 billion
since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 crew members and caused the leak.
The company has set aside $20 billion to pay for Gulf
restoration and compensation claims and said yesterday the cost
of battling the spill had reached $2.65 billion. 
Any potential attempt to buy BP would have to be backed by
&#8220;ruthless integration,&#8221; JPMorgan said. BP has many high
quality assets, including deepwater positions and upstream
operations, Lucas wrote under a future possible scenario. 
Sheila Williams, a spokeswoman for BP, declined to comment,
as did Kim Blomley, a London-based spokesman for Shell.

Microsoft Corp. scrapped the new Kin
social-networking smartphone because sales fell well short of
the company&#8217;s expectations, a person with knowledge of the
decision said. 
The phone&#8217;s high price contributed to lackluster demand,
said the person, who declined to be named because the
discussions were private. Microsoft announced plans to end work
on the Kin earlier today, saying it would focus on Windows Phone
software. The device debuted less than two months ago. 
Kin, sold through Verizon Wireless, marked Microsoft&#8217;s
first major foray into the hardware design of a mobile phone. It
was part of a dual strategy of developing its own phone while
working on new Windows software for other companies&#8217; handsets.
Verizon&#8217;s price cuts of the Kin on June 28 may have come too
late to save the phone. 
&#8220;Sales weren&#8217;t going that well at Verizon, so better to
kill it than have it fester on,&#8221; said Ken Dulaney, a Gartner
Inc. analyst in Redwood City, California. &#8220;Verizon did a very
poor job advertising this thing. The price of the data plan was
a killer.&#8221; 
Verizon required an unlimited data plan for $29.99, plus a
voice plan. The phones were released May 6 online and went on
sale in stores May 13. Those models will remain available. 
&#8220;We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell
current Kin phones,&#8221; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said
in a statement. 
Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New Jersey-
based Verizon Wireless, said the Kin &#8220;is still an important
part of our portfolio.&#8221; 
Lower Price 
Verizon cut the price of the Kin One to $29.99 from $49.99,
with a $100 discount and a two-year contract. The price of the
Kin Two, which has a larger screen and takes sharper photos, was
reduced to $49.99 from $99.99. 
The Microsoft team working on the product has been folded
into the Windows Phone unit, the company said today. A planned
release of the devices in Europe has been canceled. 
Microsoft will now focus its attention on its mobile
operating system, which has been losing market share to software
from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Mobile-phone makers will begin
offering devices with Windows Phone 7, a complete overhaul of
the software, later this year. It&#8217;s critical that those phones
fare better than the Kin, Dulaney said. 
&#8220;The big bet is on Windows Phone 7 -- if they don&#8217;t get
that right, they&#8217;re in big trouble,&#8221; he said. The Kin &#8220;was a
sidecar effort.&#8221; 
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system accounted for 6.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone-software market in the first
quarter, down from 10.8 percent a year earlier, according to
Michael Morgan, an analyst at ABI Research. Shipments of the
iPhone rose to 15.8 percent, while Android-based phones took 9.9
percent. 
Microsoft&#8217;s decision was reported earlier by Gizmodo.

After AIG&#8217;s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including
Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG
protecting them against declines in the value of mortgages. When
the housing market collapsed, AIG didn&#8217;t have enough funds to
honor its contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion. 
Joseph Cassano 
Cassano, who oversaw an AIG unit managing $2 trillion in
derivative trades, was interviewed for about five hours by FCIC
staff. He had previously shied away from public statements while
regulators investigated his role in the swaps trades, which he
said in 2007 would be profitable. 
&#8220;He was a person with extraordinary knowledge of the inner
workings of that company and the relationships with others,&#8221;
Angelides said. 
The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said on May 26 that a
review of the business Cassano oversaw didn&#8217;t turn up any
criminal violations. U.S. prosecutors also won&#8217;t bring charges,
a person familiar with the investigation said last month. 
Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren&#8217;t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. 
Bear Stearns 
Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. 
The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. 
Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

Walt Disney Co. acquired Tapulous
Inc., a developer of music-related video games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s
iPhone and iPad, to expand its mobile business. 
Disney anticipates growth on Apple&#8217;s platforms and mobile
devices, Steve Wadsworth, head of the company&#8217;s Internet unit,
said today in an interview. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
With the deal, Burbank, California-based Disney becomes one
of the biggest developers of games for Apple&#8217;s App Store.
Tapulous has 30 million users and is profitable, according to
its website. &#8220;Tap Tap Revenge,&#8221; a top-selling download at the
App Store, is played by tapping a screen to the rhythm of a
song. While the software is free, players must buy new songs. 
&#8220;This is an extremely high-growth industry, both mobile
games and mobile media,&#8221; Wadsworth said. &#8220;We are there and we
want to continue to be there in a very big way.&#8221; 
Tapulous founder and Chief Executive Officer Bart Decrem,
operating chief Andrew Lacy and the development team are joining
Disney&#8217;s mobile-games group, Wadsworth said. 
&#8220;Their ability to effectively monetize, in a very
efficient way, games on these devices is very attractive,&#8221;
Wadsworth said. &#8220;Their insight into how that works will be very
helpful as we grow on these platforms.&#8221; 
Disney Characters 
Decrem said in an interview he will be head of Disney&#8217;s
mobile division, which will create new titles based on Disney
characters and intellectual property, as well as continue to
distribute the &#8220;Tap Tap Revenge&#8221; games. 
The deal came together over the past three to four months,
Decrem said. Tapulous was considering whether to raise another
round of funding from investors when it decided to join Disney
instead. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge opportunity,&#8221; he said. 
The acquisition was reported earlier by industry website
TechCrunch.com. 
Tapulous investors include Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff and Sun Microsystems Inc. co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim,
according to the company&#8217;s website. Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s chief
executive officer, is Disney&#8217;s biggest shareholder and a
director. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 1 cent to
$31.49 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have declined 2.4 percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. refused a
request from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to reveal
how much it makes trading derivatives, saying the bank doesn&#8217;t
separate the figure from other businesses. 
&#8220;Some other firms have provided us with that data when
we&#8217;ve asked for it and Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Commissioner
Brooksley Born said today in Washington on the second day of a
hearing investigating the role of derivatives in the 2008 credit
crisis, which sparked the worst recession since the 1930s. &#8220;It
makes one wonder why Goldman has the incentive or impetus to not
release this information.&#8221; 
Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
derivatives dealer, have provided estimates to investors. The
top five U.S. commercial banks, including Goldman Sachs,
generated an estimated $28 billion in revenue from privately
negotiated derivatives in 2009, according to company reports
collected by the Federal Reserve and people familiar with banks&#8217;
income sources. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in
history, is being questioned about credit-default swap trades
with American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out
by the U.S. government after AIG was unable to meet collateral
demands from trading partners on the contracts. The swaps, used
by Goldman Sachs and other banks to hedge against declines in
the value of mortgage-linked debt, caused losses at AIG as
housing prices collapsed. 
&#8216;It&#8217;s Integrated&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
testified today that the firm has no way of separating out its
derivatives data from trading in cash securities. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a separate derivatives business,&#8221; Viniar
told the panel. &#8220;It&#8217;s integrated into the rest of our
business.&#8221; 
Commissioner Byron Georgiou said he doubted Goldman Sachs
was unable to provide the information. 
&#8220;When you tell us that you don&#8217;t know how much you make in
your derivatives business, nobody here really believes it,&#8221;
Georgiou told Viniar. &#8220;Nobody here believes that you don&#8217;t know
how much money you&#8217;re making on the various aspects of your
business, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; 
$49.1 Trillion 
Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to an Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency report last month. The bank
reported total trading revenue of $7.65 billion during the first
quarter. That follows total trading revenue of $23.2 billion in
2009, according to a filing with the Federal Reserve. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of dangerous, don&#8217;t you think, to claim to the
FCIC that you don&#8217;t know the profitability of a major line of
business,&#8221; said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the
University of Houston. &#8220;How can you rationally allocate
capital, for instance, if you don&#8217;t know the return to that
capital?&#8221; 
Under a March 2008 amendment to derivatives accounting
standards, companies are exempt from breaking out gains or
losses on derivatives used as part of a trading book that also
includes cash securities, if other information on the trading
activities is provided, according to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board&#8217;s Statement No. 161. 
Goldman Sachs is &#8220;definitely capable of providing the data
that was asked for, but I can understand their fear of doing
so,&#8221; said Brian Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at
broker-dealer Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and
a former credit swaps trader. 
Derivatives Revenue 
&#8220;There is a potential for such a number to vastly
overstate the amount of profit or loss captured by a particular
business because much of that business may be symbiotic with
another,&#8221; Yelvington said. &#8220;They may have made money on the
derivatives leg of a trade, for example, and lost it on the cash
leg.&#8221; 
JPMorgan said in February 2009 that about 8 percent of its
total revenue from 2006 to 2008 came from derivatives in its
investment-banking unit, according to a presentation made to
investors. 
That breakdown and revenue figures from regulatory filings
imply that half of JPMorgan&#8217;s $31.2 billion in trading revenue
those years came from derivatives, according to Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in New
York. 
&#8216;Highly Imprecise&#8217; 
&#8220;Reporting a revenue number, just the profit on
derivatives without looking at cash positions associated with
hedging those, is going to be a highly imprecise exercise,&#8221;
Yavorsky said in an interview today. 
Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the commission last month
after the New York-based firm sent more than a billion pages of
documents to the panel, a shipment so sizable that panel members
called it an attempt to hinder their probe. 
&#8220;We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish,&#8221; Chairman Phil Angelides,
who previously served as California&#8217;s treasurer, said June 7.
&#8220;This has been a very deliberate effort over time to run out
the clock.&#8221; 
The commission, which will report its findings to Congress
and President Barack Obama by December, said June 29 that the
bank had been more responsive to information requests since
being subpoenaed. Separately, Goldman Sachs faces a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud suit over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. The bank has said the SEC suit is
unfounded. 
Born&#8217;s Warning 
Born had warned in 1998, as chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, that the unregulated over-the-
counter derivatives market posed a danger to the global
financial system. She moved to address changes in how swaps
based on interest rates, commodities or currencies were traded
and was stopped by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
who all argued the market could regulate itself. 
Born said last year that the banks that caused the crisis
were trying to stop the congressional overhaul of the market. 
&#8220;Special interests in the financial-services industry are
beginning to advocate a return to business as usual,&#8221; Born said
in May 2009 as she accepted a Profile in Courage award from the
John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.

The price is about $400 million, according to a person

identifies devices that aren&#8217;t in compliance with corporate
policy and recommends fixes in real-time. 
IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he is
planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the next
five years. The software unit, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in 2015, the company
said in May. The unit has made about 60 acquisitions since 2003. 
BigFix, based in Emeryville, California, has about 200
employees and 700 customers, including SunTrust Bank. The deal
is expected to close this quarter. 
IBM fell 91 cents to $122.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock

Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s
largest brokerage, hired 100 bankers to offer more products such
as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney clients and may quintuple their numbers by the end of
2011, a person with knowledge of the strategy said. 
The firm is building a private bank to squeeze more revenue
from clients and encourage them to hold deposits at the company.
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s wealth management group had $191 million of
interest income in the first quarter, a fraction of the $1.1
billion at Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit. Private
bankers offer loans, savings products and sometimes investment
advice to a bank&#8217;s wealthiest clients. 
&#8220;There is always this hidden opportunity of cross-sell,&#8221;
said Steve Stelmach, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;Merrill Lynch has been successful in
offering mortgage products to their retail customers, so the
precedent is there.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley joins Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. in trying to do more business with wealthy customers as the
weak economy and new regulations make it harder to earn money
from loans and investment banking. Bankers have pushed cross-
selling for decades, often with little to show for it, to expand
their business without having to sign up new customers. 
Fed Approves Application 
&#8220;Every major financial firm has decided they are going to
grab a piece of wealth management, whether it&#8217;s private banking
or advisory,&#8221; said Jeanne Branthover, head of the financial-
services practice at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York.
&#8220;The combination of financial advisers working with the private
bankers is becoming more common. Ten years ago, they were
totally separate.&#8221; 
Private bankers are usually paid a salary and a bonus,
while financial advisers&#8217; compensation is based on commissions,
Branthover said. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York today approved Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s application to create Morgan Stanley Private Bank N.A.
It&#8217;s headed by Cece Stewart, 52, whom Morgan Stanley hired in
2008 from Wachovia Corp., where she had risen to executive vice
president from branch manager over three decades. The firm
started hiring the private bankers last year. 
Boosting Loan Balances 
The private bank plans to as much as triple its loan
balances to between $50 billion and $60 billion by the end of
2014, said the person, who declined to be named because the
plans haven&#8217;t been made public. The bank now has about $19
billion in loans largely from its previous lending efforts,
which mostly focused on agency mortgages, the person said. 
The private bank will also offer deposit products to
clients who hold more than $1.6 trillion of assets in the
brokerage. Morgan Stanley considered buying a banking franchise
before deciding to build its own private bank in the first half
of 2009, the person said. That was the same year that Morgan
Stanley formed its brokerage, which has more than 18,000
advisers, when it bought a controlling stake in the joint
venture with Citigroup. Merrill Lynch, by comparison, has about
15,000 financial advisers. 
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, said
today it named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to boost the
share of assets it holds for its wealthiest client to more than
the current 5 percent. Sommers was named CEO of Retail Affluent
and Investment Services, giving him responsibility for the
bank&#8217;s 2,700 financial advisers. 
Citigroup&#8217;s Hires 
The initiative could increase pretax profits by $500
million to $1 billion annually, Charlie Scharf, JPMorgan&#8217;s head
of retail financial services, said in a statement. 
Citigroup has hired about 15 private bankers since March
and will add another 115 over the next several years, spokesman
Mark Costiglio said in an interview last month. 
Bank of America is trying to persuade its 12 million
customers to move funds from rival brokers to Merrill Lynch and
wants Merrill Lynch clients to transfer some of the $500 billion
they have at other banks, according to a May 10 presentation.
Wells Fargo is focused on 3 million customers who keep more than
$250,000 for investments at other companies, according to Senior
Executive Vice President David Carroll. 
It&#8217;s often difficult to gauge how successful efforts to
sell clients new products are because banks rarely provide data
on their cross-selling efforts, said Stelmach, the FBR analyst. 
Jumbo Mortgages 
Morgan Stanley is now offering jumbo mortgages, home-equity
lines and securities lending, said Armando Cabo, a private
banker who joined from JPMorgan this year. The bank plans to
offer some commercial loans to clients later this year, Cabo
said. It&#8217;s offering mortgages of up to $5 million and home-
equity lines up to $2.5 million, spokesman Jim Wiggins said. 
The private bankers will work with financial advisers to
arrange lending options for clients, with the advisers remaining
the primary contact. Cabo said he&#8217;s working with about 80 to 90
advisers. 
The firm has been offering &#8220;aggressive&#8221; interest rates to
win clients, said Shawn Rubin, a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
financial adviser in New York. Lending and managing clients&#8217;
liabilities will probably be the highest-growth revenue source
of his business this year, Rubin said. 
&#8220;The markets have been very challenging for a while, and
clients are sort of used to the markets not doing a whole lot
for their net worth,&#8221; Rubin said. &#8220;So they are really focused
on the other avenues of wealth management, whether that&#8217;s risk
management or liability management.&#8221; 
Home-Loan Rates 
Record low home-loan rates may prompt some clients who had
loans with other banks, including Citigroup&#8217;s private bank, to
refinance, providing a chance for Morgan Stanley to gain market
share, Rubin said. Rates for 30-year fixed loans declined to
4.69 percent in the week ended June 24, mortgage-finance company
Freddie Mac said last week. That&#8217;s below the previous record of
4.71 percent, set in the week ended Dec. 3. 
Jumbo mortgages are larger than the ones that government-
supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can finance, now from
$417,000 to $729,750 in high-cost areas. About 10.3 percent of
U.S. prime jumbo mortgages which backed securities were at least
60 days late in May, according to Fitch Ratings. That&#8217;s up from
10.2 percent in April, marking the 36th straight increase for
&#8220;serious delinquencies.&#8221; 
Compensation Ratio 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s wealth-management unit had revenue of
$3.11 billion in the first quarter, down from $3.14 billion in
the fourth. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who led the
unit before succeeding John Mack in January, said in a letter to
shareholders this year that the joint venture will play &#8220;an
increasingly important role in our growth and profitability.&#8221; 
The effort is likely to lower the wealth-management unit&#8217;s
compensation ratio over time, according to two people briefed on
the matter. The division&#8217;s ratio of compensation costs to
revenue was 64 percent in the first quarter, compared with 41
percent in the institutional securities business, which includes
the trading and investment banking units. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re making huge investments on the lending front,
because Morgan Stanley did not do things like non-conforming
mortgages and structured or tailored loans, and we had that
through Citi&#8217;s private bank,&#8221; Charles Johnston, president of
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said in an interview in April.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge opportunity there, and we&#8217;ve got that now,
we&#8217;ve built that.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to
boost the share of assets it holds for its wealthiest clients to
more than 5 percent. 
Sommers, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Securities,
will become CEO of retail affluent and investment services,
JPMorgan said today in a statement from Business Wire. He&#8217;ll
report to Charlie Scharf, head of retail financial services. 
&#8220;Our initiative will help us serve customers better and
could increase pretax profits by $500 million to $1 billion
annually,&#8221; Scharf said in the statement. 
Banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and
Wells Fargo  Co. are encouraging wealthy customers to do more
business with them as the weak economy and new regulations make
it harder to earn money from loans and investment banking.
Morgan Stanley plans to hire as many as 500 bankers to build its
private bank, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The customers JPMorgan distinguishes as affluent typically
have at least $500,000 in investable assets, spokesman Thomas Kelly said in a telephone interview. JPMorgan Securities was
formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. 
JPMorgan shares, down 15 percent this year compared with a
6.6 percent decrease in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index, fell 3 percent to $35.48 as of 11:27 a.m. in New York

30 years at Cravath, Morgan Stanley said today in a statement.
Lynch, 59, who announced in February that he would step down
from his post, will remain vice chairman and a member of the
firm&#8217;s operating and management committees. 
Eric Grossman, the bank&#8217;s general counsel for the Americas
and global head of litigation, was appointed to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
management committee, the New York-based firm said. Grossman was
a candidate for the chief legal position, a person briefed on
the matter said in February. 
&#8220;The partnership between Frank and Eric will provide
tremendous leadership on the legal and regulatory fronts in this
challenging period for the securities industry,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman said in an internal memo obtained
today by Bloomberg News. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jeanmarie McFadden confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. 
Barron was among Cravath lawyers who advised Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s board on its conversion to a bank holding company and
on Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s $9 billion investment
in the firm as its stock plunged after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy in 2008, according to the law firm&#8217;s website. 
Represented Banks 
Barron also represented National City Corp.&#8217;s board in its
2008 sale to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and CSX Corp.,
the third-largest U.S. railroad, in its defense against activist
hedge funds seeking seats on its board. Barron has also served
banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS
AG, according to the statement. 
Barron, a Boston native, graduated from Harvard University
in 1973 and Harvard Law School in 1978. He joined Cravath that
year, rising to partner in 1985. 
Lynch headed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
enforcement division from 1985 to 1989 and led insider-trading
investigations of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Former Morgan
Stanley CEO John Mack hired Lynch to work at Credit Suisse First
Boston in 2001 and then at Morgan Stanley when Mack moved there
in 2005. Mack stepped down as CEO at the beginning of this year
and remains chairman.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
repeated their position that disputes with American
International Group Inc. over securities prices and collateral
in 2007 and 2008 reflected the firm&#8217;s typical risk-management
efforts. 
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and David Lehman, co-
head of the firm&#8217;s structured products group trading desk, are
scheduled to testify this morning before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission in Washington. Their prepared testimony
replays comments made yesterday by President and Chief Operating
Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick. 
&#8220;We established credit terms with AIG consistent with
those extended to other major counterparts, including collateral
arrangements that we tightly managed,&#8221; Viniar said in prepared
remarks. &#8220;As we do with many other counterparty relationships,
we limited our exposure to AIG through a combination of
collateral and market hedges.&#8221; 
The FCIC, led by Chairman Philip Angelides and Vice
Chairman William Thomas, today holds its second day of a two-day
hearing into the role that derivatives played in the credit
crisis, with a focus on the relationship between Goldman Sachs
and AIG, the insurer that had to be bailed out by the federal
government. Members of the committee repeatedly questioned
yesterday whether Goldman Sachs marked down the value of its
complex trades with AIG to force AIG to pay collateral. AIG
disputed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s marks as too low. 
Clients Complained 
The committee released internal e-mails yesterday that
showed Goldman Sachs employees discussing other clients such as
Tokyo-based AIOI Insurance Co. complaining that Goldman Sachs
was marking mortgage-backed securities at prices that were
&#8220;more than twice as bad as the second worst dealer&#8217;s.&#8221;
Angelides asked Goldman Sachs yesterday to provide information
about how the firm derived the prices it set on its trades with
AIG, and Cohn agreed to do so. 
Goldman Sachs, whose record profits in 2007 were helped in
part by the firm&#8217;s negative bets on subprime mortgage-related
securities, is fighting accusations from regulators, members of
Congress and former clients that the firm designed securities it
knew would fail and bet on their collapse by buying credit-
default swaps, which pay out in the event of a default. Goldman
Sachs has denied any wrongdoing. Cohn said yesterday that the
firm had shorted just 1 percent of the mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations the company
underwrote between December 2006 and June 2007. 
Pricing Sources 
In his testimony today, Lehman will say that the firm&#8217;s
prices were based on two main sources: the marks of comparable
transactions trading in the market and information obtained from
market participants through bid or offer prices for similar
securities or derivatives. 
&#8220;We would collect information generated by these
comparable transactions,&#8221; Lehman says in his testimony. &#8220;Then,
we would perform a variety of analyses on the collected
comparables in order to gain a sense of the market value of the
Goldman/AIG swaps from the pricing reflected in actual market
transactions in similar derivatives.&#8221; 
Viniar and Lehman will testify today alongside former AIG
Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger and other AIG
executives. 
Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC last July to
investigate the causes of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. The panel has until December to report its
findings to Congress.

Investors should bet that longer-term
interest rates will rise faster than short-dated ones as central
banks maintain low interest rates as the recovery takes hold,
according to Morgan Stanley. 
Five-year notes will perform best, making the most
profitable trades to buy them against 10-year and 30-year bonds,
fixed-income strategists led by Jim Caron in New York wrote in a
research report dated yesterday. Five-year rates will fall
relative to two-year ones, they said. 
&#8220;Economic stability is an underpriced risk that we believe
will be the surprise for the market in the second half of the
year as it ignites an asset reflation trade,&#8221; the strategists
said. &#8220;Much of the double dip and deflation fears are already
priced. European sovereigns muddle along and the risk premium
assigned to them declines. This will allow the forces associated
with global growth to reassert themselves, producing higher
yields and steeper curves.&#8221; 
The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year U.S.
Treasuries over five-year notes narrowed one basis point to 115
basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in London. The so-called yield
spread was at 137 basis points on March 9.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. could have
done a better job managing reputational risks as it navigated
the credit crisis and has since reconsidered some decisions,
said President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve done a good job. Could we have done a better job?
Sure.&#8221; Cohn, 49, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;With hindsight, I know a lot more today than I did
back then.&#8221; 
Cohn spoke after testifying before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, where he answered questions about the firm&#8217;s
derivatives business and particularly its interactions with
American International Group Inc., the insurer that was bailed
out by the U.S. government. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation was
marred in April when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
the firm for fraud over sales of a mortgage-backed security. The
bank has denied wrongdoing. 
&#8220;Based on all our internal data, we are doing fine, we are
doing well with our clients,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We continue to be at
the center of all flows, we continue to be engaged with clients,
we continuously are winning business.&#8221; 
Financial regulatory reform legislation, which passed the
House of Representatives yesterday and still needs Senate
approval, will require New York-based Goldman Sachs to hold more
capital, to be less leveraged, and to abandon &#8220;pure proprietary
trading,&#8221; he said. He didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility that the
firm could give up its bank holding company status sometime in
the future.

General Motors Co. is talking with a
number of banks about setting up a revolving line of credit that
may be worth $5 billion or more, said two people with knowledge
of the plan. 
The automaker could use the credit line to pay business
costs while using its cash to pay off more expensive debt, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plan is private. GM also wants to get a line of credit to
establish relationships between the company and a variety of
banks, the people said. 
The arrangements aren&#8217;t complete and the values may change,
both people said. 
Noreen Pratscher, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based GM,
declined to comment. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on GM seeking a
line of credit. 
GM is also talking with several major banks to arrange more
options for customers&#8217; car loans, one of the people said. GM
uses Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC LLC, for the bulk of its
auto lending. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp handles leasing and
AmeriCredit Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, does subprime lending
for GM&#8217;s customers and dealers. 
GM Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said at an
investor conference June 29 that GM will look at a variety of
lending sources for consumer car loans rather than carrying the
assets and liabilities of an in-house lending business on its
own books.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s first-half sales
in China surpassed those in the U.S. for the first time as the
world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy propelled global auto
demand. 
Sales in China by GM and its joint ventures totaled
1.21 million vehicles in the six months ended June 30, topping
U.S. deliveries of 1.08 million, based on figures reported
separately by the Detroit-based company. This would be the first
time any overseas market has &#8220;consistently outsold&#8221; GM&#8217;s
domestic market in the carmaker&#8217;s 102-year-old history, said
Michael Albano, a Shanghai-based spokesman. 
Surging demand among China&#8217;s 1.37 billion people is
speeding automakers&#8217; recovery after a recession cut global auto
sales last year and forced GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors
Corp., into bankruptcy. GM is counting on expansion overseas to
bolster profit as it prepares for an initial public offering as
early as the fourth quarter. 
&#8220;China is one of GM&#8217;s bright spots globally,&#8221; said John Zeng, a Shanghai-based automotive analyst at IHS Global Insight.
&#8220;GM has done a better job in the Chinese market than other
American automakers. The huge potential in this market will
continue to fuel GM&#8217;s growth here.&#8221; 
Government stimulus measures helped China&#8217;s industrywide
vehicle sales jump 46 percent last year to 13.6 million,
surpassing the U.S. for the first time to become the world&#8217;s
largest national automobile market. U.S. auto sales fell
21 percent to 10.4 million, the fewest since 1982, as
unemployment rose amid the worst recession in six decades.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecast for China this year to 10.1 percent from 11.4
percent as government restrictions on lending and real estate
slow expansion in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy. 
Asian stocks fell after the report fanned concern that
slower growth in China will undermine the global recovery. Hours
after Goldman&#8217;s revision, China increased its estimate for last
year&#8217;s growth to 9.1 percent, signaling output almost matched
Japan&#8217;s as the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. 
Goldman joins BNP Paribas, Macquarie Securities Ltd. and
China International Capital Corp. in reducing estimates as the
government tightens property restrictions to prevent overheating.
A third of China economists may cut &#8220;overly bullish&#8221; forecasts
for 2010 and 2011 in coming weeks, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
economist Lu Ting said in a June 30 note to clients. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s growth has been slowing down sharply and the
tightening measures we saw in April on property have been quite
aggressive,&#8221; Isaac Meng, a Beijing-based economist at BNP
Paribas, said in a phone interview today. 
The government won&#8217;t &#8220;launch easing measures in the short
term as the major concerns, especially about the property bubble,
haven&#8217;t been fully addressed,&#8221; Meng said. BNP this week reduced
China&#8217;s 2010 growth forecast to 9.8 percent from 10.5 percent. 
Manufacturing in the nation, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
computers and mobile phones, expanded at the slowest pace in 16
months, a survey of purchasing managers showed yesterday. Stocks
declined around the world this week on evidence that a cooling
China combined with austerity measures in Europe and slower
growth in the U.S. will hurt the global recovery. 
Stocks Fall 
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3 percent to 111.64 as
of 6:06 p.m. in Tokyo, the fourth straight decline. The gauge
has slumped 14 percent from its high this year on April 15. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China&#8217;s
stock exchanges, slid to its lowest level in 14 months this week. 
Liao Qun, a Hong Kong-based economist at Citic Bank
International Ltd, today lowered his forecast for China&#8217;s growth
this year to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent, citing the property
sector, the European crisis and the government&#8217;s 0.4 percentage
point upward revision to 2009 gross domestic product. 
The adjustment put the value of last year&#8217;s GDP at 34.05
trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement on its website. The figure translates to $4.98
trillion based on the average exchange rate between the yuan and
the dollar in 2009, suggesting Japan retained its position as
the second-largest economy with output of $5.07 trillion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
More Sustainable Pace 
Analysts including Sun Mingchun at Nomura Holdings Inc. say
China&#8217;s moderation is a sign that the government is moving the
country to a more sustainable pace of expansion after a 4
trillion yuan stimulus package drove an 11.9 percent rebound in
the first quarter. 
&#8220;The June PMI data confirms that the manufacturing sector
still remains in a solid expansion stage,&#8221; Sun, a Hong Kong-
based economist at Nomura, said in a note yesterday. &#8220;If the
decline does not continue for too long, it should prove a
healthy correction that reduces the risk of the economy
overheating.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s economy is moving in the &#8220;expected direction,&#8221;
Premier Wen Jiabao said in meetings with businesspeople and
economists this week. Policy makers will &#8220;further cement and
develop the positive economic trend&#8221; amid an &#8220;extremely
complicated&#8221; domestic and global outlook, he said. 
Macquarie cut its growth estimate for China to 9.5 percent
to 10 percent from a previous 10 percent to 10.5 percent last
month and CICC said in May that growth would likely ease to 9.5
percent from a previous estimate of 10.5 percent. 
&#8220;The momentum of growth has moderated as expected, but we
do not see a sharp slowdown in China,&#8221; Liu Li-Gang, economist
at Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in Hong Kong.
&#8220;With this moderation, this will be a good thing for policy
makers that they don&#8217;t have to tighten excessively.&#8221;

Electricite de France SA, Europe&#8217;s
biggest power generator, is facing demands to justify ballooning
cost estimates for extending the lives of French nuclear
reactors as the government opens the market to competitors. 
&#8220;Many decisions will hinge on&#8221; the cost estimates,
including the rates rivals will pay for EDF electricity
supplies, Pierre-Franck Chevet, the top official at France&#8217;s
Energy Ministry, said in an interview. &#8220;We will need some
estimates to set the rates&#8221; next year, he said. 
EDF will have to spend about 600 million euros ($750
million) on each of its 58 reactors to keep them in service for
longer, according to Chief Executive Officer Henri Proglio.
That&#8217;s 50 percent more than an estimate given earlier this year.
The utility will have to fork out almost 35 billion euros in 20
years to keep aging plants in working order, the CEO has said. 
Cost estimates have taken on greater urgency as lawmakers
study a planned electricity market law that may force EDF to
sell about a quarter of the power from its nuclear reactors to
GDF Suez SA and others. The law, in the Senate after approval by
the National Assembly last month, follows probes by European
Union regulators into EDF&#8217;s dominance in the French market. 
While the work on EDF&#8217;s reactors won&#8217;t start until the next
decade, the government needs rough cost estimates to calculate
the wholesale power rates the utility can charge rivals on what
may be as much as 100 terawatt-hours a year. The price will be
set by the government in consultation with the energy regulator
after the law is passed. 
Explain Costs 
The ministry has ordered state-owned EDF to spell out costs
to upgrade the French plants, which are on average 24 years old,
Chevet said. 
Extending French reactor operations will be &#8220;one of the
most important issues for the next two or three years,&#8221; Chevet
said. &#8220;I do not know the basis of the 400 million euros or the
600 million euros at this stage.&#8221; 
EDF&#8217;s 30-year-old French nuclear reactors are now
undergoing inspections by the Autorite de Surete Nucleaire,
France&#8217;s nuclear safety watchdog, to determine whether they can
operate for another decade. 
Keeping them going for more than four decades would be
cheaper than building new ones, such as the EPR model the
utility is developing for 4 billion euros in Flamanville,
Normandy. 
Precise Information 
&#8220;We want this examined in-depth,&#8221; Chevet said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not simple, there are a lot of technical issues.&#8221; Getting more
precise information could take at least a year and will depend
on how long EDF wants to operate the reactors. 
Proglio has described the proposed power law as
&#8220;expropriation&#8221; and warned against the &#8220;pillage&#8221; of the
utility by setting the price too low. At a Senate hearing last
month, Proglio said the minimum price should be 42 euros a
megawatt hour, which should be &#8220;progressively&#8221; raised to 45
euros a megawatt-hour to include costs of extending the lives of
French reactors. 
French regulated rates for households currently assume EDF
base power supply costs of about 34 megawatts an hour. EDF&#8217;s
rivals say that is about where the wholesale price should be set
to enable them to compete on that market. 
GDF Suez, the former French gas monopoly which operates
seven reactors in Belgium, has estimated costs to extend the
lifetime of its reactors at about 400 million euros each,
although this has to be evaluated plant by plant and depends on
the extension, Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet said
this week following a hearing at the French Senate. 
Industrial Challenge 
&#8220;Extending the lives of nuclear reactors is an industrial
challenge and it&#8217;s to be expected that the wholesale price will
permit this when the time comes, and I repeat when the time
comes,&#8221; Mestrallet told lawmakers. 
Making rivals pay up front for the costs isn&#8217;t right, he
said. EDF&#8217;s share price could rise or fall by 1.50 euros for
each year the average lifetime of the reactors is extended or
reduced, according to Louis Boujard, an analyst at Aurel BGC in
Paris. 
&#8220;EDF must come up with a solid case,&#8221; to justify the cost
estimates, Chevet said. &#8220;The costs depend a lot on the extent
of the extension that is envisaged.&#8221;

India&#8217;s current-account deficit may
&#8220;remain high&#8221; this year as economic growth boosts imports,
adding pressure on the rupee to weaken in the near term, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. 
&#8220;There are near-term weakening pressures on the rupee
exacerbated by external uncertainties,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
economists Pranjul Bhandari and Tushar Poddar wrote in a report
to clients yesterday. 
The current-account gap, a measure of trade and investment
flows, widened to a record $13 billion in the quarter through
March, the central bank said June 30, sending the rupee headed
to its biggest weekly loss in a month. The currency slid 0.7
percent this week to 46.625 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. in Mumbai. 
The Reserve Bank of India yesterday said India has become
more vulnerable to slowdowns and financial crises abroad as
foreign trade plays a bigger role in the economy. Trade
represented 35 percent of gross domestic product in the year
ended March 31, 2008, from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank. 
Goldman economists expect the rupee to gain over a six-to-
12-month period as faster growth attracts foreign investments. 
Goldman forecasts the rupee to touch 47.5 against the
dollar in three months, 46 in six months and 44.5 in a year,
according to the note. 
India&#8217;s $1.2 trillion economy may expand 8.5 percent in the
year ending March 31, from 7.4 percent in the previous year,
according to the finance ministry.

The private equity wing of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Capital are to buy diaper maker Ontex
from Candover Investments Plc for 1.2 billion euros ($1.5
billion), the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it
got the information. 
The deal, which faltered when Goldman&#8217;s initial private
equity partner withdrew, may be announced as early as this week,
according to the newspaper. Ontex has about 60 percent of the
European market for non-label diapers, the Telegraph said. 
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Fiona Laffan declined to comment
on the report.
