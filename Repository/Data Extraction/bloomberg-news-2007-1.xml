Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world's largest
soft-drink maker, will shift some of outgoing marketing chief
Mary Minnick's responsibilities to recently promoted President
Muhtar Kent. 
Kent will oversee marketing for the Atlanta-based company
beginning March 1, Chief Executive Officer Neville Isdell, said
today in an internal memo to employees. Minnick, who was passed
over when Kent was named president and chief operating officer
in December, said last week she will leave in February to pursue
other personal and professional goals in the U.K. 
The move gives more responsibility to Kent, 54, who is
Coca-Cola's second-highest ranking executive and likely
successor to Isdell. Coca-Cola's strategy and innovation groups,
formerly overseen by Minnick, will report to Isdell. 
``As the health of our business continues to improve, the
factors that necessitated the combining of marketing, strategy
and innovation have evolved,'' Isdell, 63, said in the memo. 
The new structure allows Coca-Cola to ``increase the impact
and effectiveness of the global marketing community, while
preserving the benefits we have captured'' by previously
combining the groups, wrote Isdell, who hasn't said when he
plans to retire. 
Coca-Cola also said today Marc Mathieu, who previously
oversaw marketing for brands such as Coca-Cola, Sprite and
Fanta, will assume similar duties for noncarbonated drinks
including Dasani and Powerade. 
Shares of Coca-Cola fell 23 cents to $48.03 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They increased 20
percent last year, the biggest annual gain since 1997.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will go head-to-head
with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) in Super Bowl television advertising for the
first time in almost a decade as it tries to boost sales of its
top-selling drink. 
One new ad for Coca-Cola Classic will air during
professional football's championship game along with two spots
that debuted during the television show ``American Idol,'' the
Atlanta-based company said in a statement today. Coca-Cola hasn't
run promotions during the Super Bowl since 1998. 
Advertising during television's most-watched event pits
Coca-Cola against PepsiCo as both companies try to reverse a drop
in U.S. soda sales. PepsiCo has advertised during the Super Bowl
for 21 consecutive years and will sponsor the half-time show for
the first time. 
``Coke wants back in the game,'' said Z. John Zhang,
marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``They've waited this many years to come back, so
the pressure is on them to have the louder voice.'' 
Both soft-drink makers are trying to stop declines in the
U.S., where soda consumption dropped in 2005 for the first time
in at least 15 years because of concern that sugary beverages
contribute to obesity. Coca-Cola's soft drink volume fell 1
percent in North America during the third quarter, and PepsiCo's
dropped 2 percent. 
Cost of Ads 
Coca-Cola's Super Bowl advertisements include a 60-second
spot titled ``Video Game,'' showing a character who passes out
bottles of Coca-Cola Classic to people he meets on the street.
Coca-Cola will also run a 30-second ad called ``Happiness
Factory'' that follows a bottle of Coke through an imaginary
vending machine. 
The company won't say anything about the new commercial
being made for the Super Bowl. The ads were created by
independent agency Wieden + Kennedy, based in Portland, Oregon. 
``Coca-Cola Classic has always been about having fun, and
that's what people get together to do when they watch the Super
Bowl,'' said Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coca-Cola
brands in North America. 
Shares of Coca-Cola fell 1 cent to $48.13 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They gained 20 percent
last year, the biggest gain since 1997. 
PepsiCo shares climbed 36 cents to $65.20. They rose 5.9
percent last year. 
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan McDermott wouldn't say how much
the company is spending on the game. A 30-second ad during the
Super Bowl can cost $2.5 million, according to AdWeek. Coca-
Cola's advertising budget was $2.48 billion in 2005. 
Bears vs. Colts 
More than 141 million people watched last year's Super Bowl.
This year's game, scheduled for Feb. 4 at Dolphin Stadium in
Miami Gardens, Fla., is a match-up between the Chicago Bears and
the Indianapolis Colts. 
The Super Bowl will be broadcast on CBS Corp.'s CBS network.
The television show American Idol, the most popular show on
primetime television, airs on News Corp.'s Fox network. 
In addition to the half-time show sponsorship, PepsiCo plans
to run 90 seconds of ads during the first half of the Super Bowl,
spokeswoman Nicole Bradley said. She wouldn't say how much the
company is spending, or which ads it plans to run. 
PepsiCo has a promotion featuring a sterling silver can of
Pepsi studded with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. The company
will give away the can, worth $100,000, and Super Bowl tickets
for life after the half-time show, which includes a performance
by the musician Prince. 
``We thrive on the Super Bowl spotlight. It's been a part of
our game plan for more than two decades,'' Bradley said. 
Last year, Coca-Cola sponsored a Super Bowl pre-game show
with its Full Throttle energy drink. Ads showed a semi-tractor
trailer truck mounted with an oversized can of Full Throttle
overtaking a small pickup truck with a slender can of rival
energy drink Red Bull.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world's largest
soft-drink maker, agreed to buy Fuze Beverage LLC to add more
juice, tea and energy drinks in an effort to catch up with
PepsiCo Inc. 
Coca-Cola gains a half-dozen new products including Fuze
Tea, NOS energy drinks and Fuze Slenderize, which has chromium
and amino acids that Fuze says help promote weight loss. Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola didn't disclose terms of the purchase. 
Fuze beverages may help Coca-Cola win back customers who
switched from sugary sodas to drinks such as PepsiCo's SoBe tea.
It's Coca-Cola's biggest U.S. acquisition since buying Odwalla
Inc. in 2001 for $186 million to gain protein drinks and juices,
said John Sicher, editor of industry journal Beverage Digest. 
``This represents Coke aggressively getting itself into a
better place in the noncarbonated business in the U.S.,'' Sicher
said. ``Fuze is small but growing strongly.'' 
Sicher estimated that Coca-Cola paid $225 million to $250
million for closely held Fuze. He said the Englewood Cliffs, New
Jersey-based company sold about 11.5 million cases last year, up
from 8 million cases in 2005, generating $90 million to $100
million in revenue. 
Shares of Coca-Cola rose 22 cents to $48.10 at 4:22 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They increased 20
percent last year, their biggest gain since 1997. 
Bottlers 
The Fuze purchase may help sate bottlers that had
complained about Coca-Cola falling behind PepsiCo in adding
drinks other than soda. Coca-Cola depends on soda for 80 percent
of its volume, compared with less than 20 percent for PepsiCo. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), the largest distributor, agreed
to distribute Arizona bottled teas in the U.S. last year, making
good on a promise to get new drinks from someone other than Coca-
Cola if it needed to. The bottler is 36 percent owned by Coca-
Cola. 
``This should be well-received by Coke's bottlers,'' Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote today in a note. 
Fuze was already distributed by 20 Coca-Cola bottlers
including Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United of Birmingham, Alabama,
and the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
Only about 15 percent of Fuze's volume currently goes
through Coca-Cola bottlers, Pecoriello wrote. The Cadbury
Schweppes Bottling Group had distributed Fuze in much of the
U.S., Sicher said. 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, the second-largest
bottler for Coca-Cola, sells Cinnabon bottled coffee and created
a separate unit called Beverages and Beyond Brands to create or
buy drinks it wasn't getting from the soda maker. 
Coca-Cola's soda volume in the U.S. dropped by a low single
digit in 2005, while noncarbonated volume jumped 10 percent.
