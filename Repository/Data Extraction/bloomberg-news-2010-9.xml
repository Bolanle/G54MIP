Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest
software maker, sued Datel Design  Development Ltd., claiming
the U.K. company is infringing design patents for controllers
used with the Xbox 360 video-game system. 
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle today,
Microsoft is seeking damages and a court order that would halt
sales of Datel's TurboFire and WildFire controllers. Microsoft
also sued Datel in the U.K. and filed a complaint with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington, seeking to block
U.S. imports of the controllers made in China. 
The game controllers provide "a firepower advantage that
can make all the difference," Datel, based in Staffordshire,
England, said on its Web site. They can turn a single-shot
pistol in the "Call of Duty" into "lethal, fully automatic
weapons that can empty a clip on an enemy in a second." 
The patent complaints "appear retaliatory," Datel lawyer
Martin Glick said in a telephone interview. "They said the
controller would interfere with the fair play of games and then
they licensed a controller that did exactly that." 
Glick, of Howard Rice in San Francisco, said he hadn't
reviewed the complaints so couldn't comment on the specific
allegations. 
Unfair Advantage 
Microsoft has said in court filings that the accessories
give their users an unfair advantage in multiplayer gaming. The
TurboFire and WildFire controllers copy unique designs protected
by six U.S. patents, Microsoft said in the complaint. 
More than 74 million Xbox 360 game controllers have been
sold worldwide since 2005, including about 40 million in the
U.S., according to the ITC complaint. 
"The designs of the WildFire Controller are the same or
substantially the same to the eye of the ordinary observer as
the ornamental designs claimed in the Microsoft patents,"
Microsoft said. 
Datel also sells a memory card that it says is four times
as powerful as the one that Microsoft offers. In October,
Microsoft deployed what it called a "dashboard update" that
disabled Datel's memory cards. 
Datel filed an antitrust lawsuit in November against
Microsoft, claiming the Redmond, Washington-based company seeks
to monopolize the markets for multiplayer online gaming systems
and for accessories not sold directly with the Xbox. 
Memory Cards 
Glick, who called the update a "downgrade," said it was
designed to shut down Datel because the memory cards were
driving down the price of Microsoft's. 
Microsoft has asked that the antitrust suit be dismissed,
saying Datel isn't legally entitled to sell "accessories that
open the door for cheating that harms the Xbox 360 ecosystem." 
Microsoft said in the ITC complaint it has sold or licensed
more than $7 billion worth of products that use the patents at
issue in the case. "U.S. sales and licensing revenue for Xbox
360 gamepads alone account for more than $100 million," the
company said in the complaint. 
"The success of Microsoft's Xbox 360 has not gone
unnoticed by others who seek to gain from Microsoft's
investment, creativity and goodwill," the company said in the
filing. 
The new case is Microsoft Corp. v. Datel Design and
Development Ltd., 10cv562, U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington (Seattle). The antitrust case is Datel
Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp., 09cv5535, U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California (San Francisco). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Game Controllers,
Complaint No. 2722, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).

Microsoft Corp., the world's largest
software maker, has no plans to make a version of its Office
suite of programs to run on Apple Inc.'s iPad, said Stephen
Elop, president of Microsoft's business division. 
Elop said the company would take a "wait and see"
approach to tailoring software for the iPad, which goes on sale
on April 3. He also said Google Inc. hasn't made any headway
against Microsoft in the business software market. 
"We haven't heard anything about Google making inroads
against Office, because they're not," Elop said today in an
interview. Office includes word-processing, spreadsheet and
other business-productivity programs. 
Microsoft will begin selling the next version of the
product, dubbed Office 2010, on May 12. The debut comes as
Google and other Web companies are pushing alternatives that
cost less or are even free. Office brings in about 90 percent of
the revenue of Elop's division, which is the company's largest
and one of its most profitable. 
The version of Office 2010 that goes on sale on May 12 is
designed for businesses. A version for consumers will be
available by late June. By then, the company also will introduce
stripped-down versions of Word and the spreadsheet program Excel
that are accessible free over the Web. 
Demand looks promising, particularly from companies, and 6
million people have downloaded a prerelease "beta" version of
the product, Elop said. That's twice as many as downloaded the
beta version of Office 2007, the last upgrade. 
Of those beta users polled by Microsoft, 80 percent said
they would recommend Office 2010 to friends, and 90 percent said
the software made them more productive, he said. 
Cloud Computing 
Elop said corporate buyers are less interested in
discussing Google and other competitors and more concerned about
whether to move to new "cloud"-based versions of Microsoft
software. Customers who choose this route don't run the software
on their own computers, instead paying a monthly fee to
Microsoft to deliver it over the Internet from the company's
massive data centers. 
"We never say never, but we have no current plans" to
develop a version of Office for the Apple iPad, Elop said. Last
year Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it would create a
version to work on Nokia Oyj's smartphones, since millions of
Office users already own those devices. 
An iPad edition of Office would likely be built by a unit
within Microsoft's consumer business that creates versions of
Office that work with Apple's Macintosh personal computers.
Kristen Woody, a spokesman for that unit, says it "doesn't have
anything to share at this time." 
Microsoft fell 13 cents to $29.16 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. After gaining 57 percent last year,
the shares have slipped 4.3 percent in 2010.

Microsoft Corp. failed in its bid to
have a U.S. appeals court take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change its popular Word
software and resulted in a damage award that's grown to more
than $290 million. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit today
rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. 
Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. 
I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. 
Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. 
The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said he regrets using the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.'s guarantee program to issue $40 billion in
unsecured debt during the height of the financial crisis. 
"We didn't need it," Dimon, 54, said in his annual letter
to shareholders, which was released yesterday. "And it just
added to the argument that all banks had been bailed out and
fueled the anger directed toward banks." 
Dimon said the New York-based company was "highly
criticized" for issuing debt backed by the FDIC and for
accepting $25 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
The company repaid all TARP funds in June, stopped using the
FDIC's program last April and shunned participation in other
federal programs "to avoid the stigma," he said. 
JPMorgan, which ranks second behind Bank of America Corp.
in deposits and assets among U.S. lenders, remained profitable
through the crisis with combined net income of $17.3 billion in
the last two years. The company issued $20.8 billion in FDIC-
guaranteed long-term debt in 2008, and $19.7 billion in 2009. 
"It was not a question of access or need," Dimon said of
the FDIC program, whose government backing helped keep interest
rates low. "The markets always were open to us, but the program
did save us money." 
FDIC Program 
FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment. About 6,500
eligible institutions opted out of the Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program. More than 80 banks and thrifts used the
program to issue debt, about $305.4 billion of which was still
outstanding as of Feb. 28, according to FDIC data. 
Dimon apologized for what he said were the bank's mistakes.
He said the two biggest were lowering mortgage underwriting
standards and making too many leveraged loans that "may have
contributed to the financial crisis." At the same time, he
claimed some credit for helping to stabilize markets through
JPMorgan's purchases of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual. 
He also sought to deflect some of the public anger toward
financial companies and to correct the perception that all banks
would have failed if the federal government hadn't intervened. 
"We should acknowledge that the worst offenders among
financial companies no longer are in existence," Dimon said.
"And while it is true that some of the surviving banks would
not, or might not, have survived, not all banks would have
failed." 
Dimon, who took over as CEO in 2005, said his "No. 1
priority" this year is to find his successor. 
Internal Candidates 
"Poor CEO succession has destroyed many a company," Dimon
said, adding that the board believes there are several strong
internal candidates that could "do my job today." He said
JPMorgan will continue rotating senior staff across the business
to ensure they could smoothly take over the company. 
The company also intends to expand retail banking, which
accounted for $97 million of JPMorgan's $11.7 billion in net
income last year. Dimon said the bank will add 2,700 personal
bankers, 400 investment sales representatives and 120 more
branches this year, even though consumer lending lost $3.8
billion in 2009. The bank plans to ramp up its branch expansion
in California and Florida over the next two years, building on
its acquisition of Washington Mutual, he said.

Shopping mall owner General Growth
Properties Inc. filed definitive documents last night to raise
$6.55 billion in new equity from three investors in return for
65 percent of the stock. General Growth is setting up a bidding
procedure where other investors could end up being the equity
sponsors. 
In return for agreeing to be the so-called stalking-horse,
the three investors -- Fairholme Capital Management LLC,
Pershing Square Capital Management LP, and Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. -- will be given warrants for 120 million shares
exercisable at $15 a share. General Growth said in its court
filing last night that the warrants are worth $520 million. 
Combined with $1.5 billion through a new debt offering or
reinstatement of existing debt, General Growth says it will have
enough capital to confirm a plan at the holding company level.
Only $1 billion in debt at the property-owning level remains to
be formally reorganized through confirmation of reorganization
plans. 
General Growth says the plan will be sufficient to pay
unsecured creditors in full with interest. 
At an April 29 hearing, General Growth will ask the
bankruptcy judge to approve the warrants to the stalking-horse
investors and a schedule for wrapping up the case. General
Growth wants the first round of bids submitted by April 19, even
before the judge has approved procedures. 
General Growth is offering as much as $1 million in expense
reimbursement for anyone who participates in the bidding
process. 
The second round of bids would be due June 2, if the judge
agrees with the schedule. General Growth and representatives of
existing stockholders will then compare the bids, negotiate
further, and select the winning investors in time for filing a
reorganization plan and disclosure statement on July 2. 
The hearing for approval of the disclosure statement would
take place July 30, followed by a confirmation hearing for
approval of the plan on Sept. 30. 
Assuming there are no other bids, Fairholme would end up
with 28 percent of the new stock for a $2.8 billion investment.
Pershing Square is in line for 11 percent for $1.1 billion, and
Brookfield would receive 26 percent for $2.625 billion. 
Existing shareholders will retain 34 percent of the stock
through the Chapter 11 plan. Existing equity holders will also
receive 80 percent of the equity in a new company to own non-
core assets. 
General Growth also filed an operating report yesterday
showing $70.1 million in operating income during February on
revenue of $204.5 million. Interest expense in the month was
$91.7 million. 
The month produced $208.6 million in net income thanks to a
$222.9 million gain on reorganization items. In February, the
loss before  taxes, non-controlling interests and reorganization
items was $21.6 million. 
In seven batches of confirmations since December, General
Growth has formally reorganized property-owning subsidiaries
holding all except $1 billion on debt below the holding
companies. 
General Growth began the largest real estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The books
of Chicago-based General Growth had assets of $29.6 billion and
total liabilities of $27.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2008. It owns
or manages more than 200 shopping-mall properties. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
Updates 
Crescent Selects UBS and Aladdin as Lead Arrangers 
Real estate developer Crescent Resources LLC jilted RBS
Securities Inc. and instead intends on marrying itself to other
arrangers for a $125 million secured financing to aid in an exit
from bankruptcy reorganization. Creditors are voting on the
Crescent Chapter 11 plan in advance of a May 20 confirmation
hearing. 
Although the bankruptcy court already approved using RBS to
serve as lead arranger, Crescent said in a March 30 bankruptcy
court filing that UBS Securities LLC and Aladdin Capital LLC
made a better offer that has a "higher likelihood of success"
and contains "more favorable terms for the debtors." 
Crescent arranged an April 5 hearing for approval of the
agreement with UBS and Aladdin. For other Bloomberg coverage,
click here. 
Crescent's disclosure statement tells holders of $1.55
billion in pre-bankruptcy loans that they stand to recover 38
percent by receiving all the new stock and $265 million in two
tranches of second-lien notes. 
General unsecured creditors with almost $305 million in
claims are to be given the senior interest in a litigation
trust. The pre-bankruptcy lenders will have a subordinate
interest in the trust. The disclosure statement doesn't specify
the percentage recovery unsecured creditors are to receive. 
Secured lenders with mortgages against specific projects
are being paid in full, in some cases by receiving their
collateral. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Crescent filed under
Chapter 11 in June with commercial, residential and multifamily
projects in 10 southeastern and southwestern states. It listed
assets of $2.2 billion against debt totaling $1.9 billion,
including almost $1.5 billion on pre-bankruptcy credit
agreements. Crescent is a joint venture between Duke Energy
Corp. and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. 
The case is In re Crescent Resources LLC, 09-11507, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Western District Texas (Austin). 
Lehman Proposes Buying Up Notes Underlying Flip Deals 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed a motion asking for
authority to extricate itself from derivate and swap agreements
where there are disputes about Lehman's rights. 
Many of the transactions involve a so-called flip clause in
a swap where collateral ordinarily would go first to a Lehman
subsidiary as the swap counterparty. Under the flip clause, the
bankruptcy of the swap counterparty or an affiliate would have
the collateral go first to noteholders and only to Lehman after
the noteholders were fully paid. 
The bankruptcy judge gave Lehman a victory when he ruled on
Jan. 25 in one of the transactions that the flip clause violates
a provision in bankruptcy law prohibiting so-called ipso facto
clauses where someone loses rights simply for filing in
bankruptcy or becoming insolvent. 
Despite Lehman's victory, the liquidating broker said the
counterparties aren't settling and in some cases are asserting
rights under foreign law where the result might follow an
English decision upholding the flip clause. 
To short circuit the third parties, Lehman is asking for
authority to buy up enough notes so it can force the liquidation
of collateral in particular transactions. Given Lehman's success
in litigation, the motion says that the notes are often trading
for less than market value. 
By buying up enough notes in a transaction, Lehman says it
may also have power in some cases to force settlement. Lehman
believes that buying notes will bring a quicker result than
litigating each transaction separately. 
If the bankruptcy judge grants the motion at an April 20
hearing, Lehman could buy as much as $25 million in notes in any
particular transaction so long as a creditors' committee
financial professional does not object within six hours. For
individual purchases more than $25 million, the judge must
approve if the creditors' committee doesn't consent. 
To read about the January decision regarding flip
transactions, click here and look for the Advance Sheets item in
the Feb. 1 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. 
More than 20 financial institutions and creditors objected
to Lehman's proposal for alternative dispute resolution of
claims. Wells Fargo Bank NA, for example, contends that the
three-step process is too time consuming and expensive for
creditors. The bank, as trustee in securitization trusts,
objects to how Lehman can name four mediators from which the
creditors must select one. 
The bank wants the ability to make counter proposals when
Lehman submits a settlement offer in advance of mediation. The
bank wants the right to attend mediation through teleconference
rather than being required to be present in person in New York. 
Wells Fargo and others want the ability to compel Lehman to
produce information in advance of mediation. 
The hearing for approval of mediation procedures is on the
bankruptcy court calendar for consideration at an April 14
hearing. 
Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP, Lehman's chief bankruptcy
counsel, disclosed in a bankruptcy court filing this week that
its top partners are charging $990 an hour. The least-expensive
partner's hourly rate is $725. The top rate for associates is
$695. The top rate for a partner from a foreign office $1,000. 
From the inception of the Chapter 11 case in September 2008
through February, Weil Gotshal charged Lehman $157.5 million. To
read other Bloomberg coverage, click here. 
The Lehman holding company filed under Chapter 11 in New
York on Sept. 15, 2008, and sold office buildings and the North
American investment banking business to London-based Barclays
Plc one week later. The Lehman brokerage operations went into
liquidation on Sept. 19, 2008, in the same court. The brokerage
is in the control of a trustee appointed under the Securities
Investor Protection Act. 
The Lehman holding company Chapter 11 case is In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, while the liquidation
proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act for the
brokerage operation is Securities Investors Protection Corp. v.
Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District New York (Manhattan). 
Accredited Home at Impasse with Lone Star on Plan 
Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., a home mortgage
originator and securitizer prior to the Chapter 11 filing in
May, says negotiations on a Chapter 11 plan are at "impasse." 
The indenture trustee for junior subordinated noteholders
sued the owner Lone Star Funds, alleging fraudulent
representations were made in connection with the $300 million
acquisition in 2007. Since then, there were negotiations on a
Chapter 11 plan that failed, Accredited Home said in a March 29
motion for an extension of the exclusive right to propose a
Chapter 11 plan. 
The company says that the noteholders asked to hold up the
plan process for at least three months. To accommodate the
request, the company is asking to stretch out the exclusive
plan-filing right until Nov. 1. 
A hearing on the exclusivity motion will take place April
21. 
In the motion, Accredited Home said it filed a tax return
in February asking for a $57 million refund. The refund hasn't
yet been received. 
The creditors' committee already has a motion on the April
21 calendar for authority to bring claims on behalf of the
company against Dallas-based Lone Star. 
Accredited sold the mortgage servicing business in July
after the Chapter 11 filing in May. Most of the mortgage loans
were sold later. Lone Star also owns Bruno's Supermarkets LLC
and Bi-Lo LLC, two grocery retailers in Chapter 11. 
The Chapter 11 petition said assets are less than $50
million while debt exceeds $100 million. 
The case is In re Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., 09-
11516, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Still No LBO Settlement and No Reorg Plan for Tribune 
Newspaper publisher Tribune Co. is asking for a fifth
extension of the exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. 
The creditors' committee supports extending the deadline by
one month, to April 30. Tribune is aiming for an April 13
hearing on the so-called exclusivity motion. 
Tribune filed an operating report yesterday showing a $2.7
million net profit in February on $221.8 million in revenue. 
The case remains stuck in disputes over whether the $13.8
billion leveraged buyout led by Sam Zell in December 2007
resulted in fraudulent transfers. Tribune reiterated its belief
that settling the claims through a plan is the best outcome. 
Tribune said it couldn't provide details on negotiations
due to "confidentiality concerns." It promised to make more
disclosures before the April 13 hearing. 
The operating report has a $16.4 million operating profit
in February. Reorganization costs that cut into net profit
totaled $7.4 million. 
Creditors are working on the theory that the LBO was a
fraudulent transfer because operating subsidiaries put liens on
their assets to finance the Zell acquisition while not receiving
commensurate value in return. 
Tribune is the second-largest newspaper publisher in the
U.S. Tribune listed $13 billion in debt for borrowed money and
assets of $7.6 billion in the Chapter 11 reorganization begun in
December 2008. It owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times,
six other newspapers and 23 television stations. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District Delaware (Wilmington). 
Lyondell Settles Environmental Claim to Ease Confirmation 
Chemical producer Lyondell Chemical Co. negotiated a
settlement of $5.5 billion in environmental claims, in the
process removing an obstacle to approval of the reorganization
plan at the April 23 confirmation hearing. 
Under the plan and the settlement, Lyondell will transfer
specific environmentally impaired properties it owns to a trust
along with cash to perform a cleanup. 
All together, the U.S. government and seven states will
have approved unsecured claims aggregating $1.18 billion. In
addition, Lyondell will contribute $108.4 million cash to the
trust and pay another $61.6 million to settle other claims. 
The settlement will be up for approval at the April 23
confirmation hearing. To read other Bloomberg coverage, click
here. 
Financing for Lyondell's plan includes a backstopped $2.8
billion equity rights offering plus $5 billion in debt financing
via an asset-backed facility, a note offering, and a term loan. 
To read about the plan and the settlement with the
unsecured creditors' committee, click here and look for the
Lyondell item in the March 9 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. 
Lyondell and affiliate Equistar Chemicals LP, together
making up the third-largest independent producer of chemicals,
filed under Chapter 11 in January 2009, listing assets of $33.8
billion and debt totaling $30.3 billion. The parent
LyondellBasell Industries AF SCA filed under Chapter 11 in
April. Including the parent and European subsidiaries, the
assets were $40 billion in September 2008. Total revenue in 2007
was $44 billion. The Lyondell petition says its assets are $27.1
billion against $19.3 billion in debt while Equistar listed
assets and debt both totaling $9 billion. 
The case is Lyondell Chemical Co., 09-10023, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Madoff Trustee Changing Market-Maker Business Sale 
The trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc. agreed to modify the contract with Castor Pollux Securities
LLC, which purchased the Madoff market-making business in June
2009 for $1 million cash plus as much as another $24.5 million
based on gross revenue through December 2013. Without modifying
the contract, the trustee said in his March 30 bankruptcy court
filing that Castor Pollux, now formally named Surge Trading
Inc., would go out of business. 
So far, Surge has paid the upfront price plus $3.39 million
on the earnout. Surge's problems arise from the remainder of the
earnout that represents a contingent liability precluding the
company from compliance with net capital requirements and
blocking the auditor from certifying the 2009 financial
statements. 
To solve the problem, the Madoff trustee agreed that Surge
could transfer the business to a newly formed subsidiary not
directly liable for the earnout. The trustee said he negotiated
provisions in the agreement "to mitigate" the possibly of not
being paid. 
The agreement will come to bankruptcy court for approval at
an April 16 hearing. 
The Madoff firm began liquidating in December 2008 with the
appointment of a trustee under the SIPA. Madoff himself went
into an involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation in April. His
bankruptcy case was consolidated with the firm's liquidation. 
The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection
Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc., 08-01789,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District New York (Manhattan).
The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-cr-00213, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
BankUnited Wants Exclusivity until Tax Return Filed 
BankUnited Financial Corp., the holding company whose bank
was taken over and sold by regulators in May, is proposing a
novel approach for a deadline on the exclusive right to propose
a Chapter 11 plan. 
BankUnited says that tax attributes are among the "most
valuable assets." The holding company is currently in the
process of selecting tax advisers to prepare the return for the
period ended in September. 
The tax attributes include net operating loss carrybacks,
refund rights and loss carryforwards. 
BankUnited says that a plan can't be worked out until there
is a good picture of the tax situation. Therefore, the holding
company wants so-called exclusivity extended until 90 days after
the tax return is filed. 
A major issue in the case is the $4.9 billion claim filed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for the
failed bank subsidiary. While BankUnited believes a
"substantial portion" of the claim is "simply invalid,"
leaving the claim untouched would "dominate the distribution
scheme under any plan and significantly dilute the return
available to other creditors." 
BankUnited filed lists of assets and creditors, showing
$557 million owing to unsecured creditors. There are no secured
claims. Assets were listed for $21 million. 
The bank's failure cost the FDIC $4.9 billion. It had
deposits of $8.6 billion and $12.8 billion in assets. Debt of
the Coral Gables, Florida-based holding company includes $120
million on convertible senior notes, $12.5 million of junior
subordinated debentures, $184 million in mandatorily convertible
senior notes known as HiMeds, and $237 million in trust
preferred securities. 
The case is In re BankUnited Financial Corp., 09-19940,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District Florida (Miami). 
Control of W Hotel Union Square Thrown into Doubt 
Whether one of three mezzanine lenders to the W New York
Union Square hotel had the right to file a Chapter 11 petition
on March 23 was thrown into doubt yesterday in a lawsuit filed
in bankruptcy court by Union Square Real Holding Corp., the new
owner of a mezzanine loan on the hotel. 
In the complaint, USRHC is asking the bankruptcy judge to
prevent the bankrupt mezzanine lender, Hotels Union Square Mezz
1 LLC, from putting the hotel itself into Chapter 11. 
USRHC explains in the complaint how the $285 million
acquisition of the hotel in October 2006 was financed by a $115
million first mortgage, three mezzanine loans totaling $117
million, and a $53 million equity investment by an affiliate of
Dubai World. 
USRHC spent $3.6 million on March 9 to buy a second $37
million mezzanine loan. USRHC made the new investment to protect
its $53 million investment in the hotel. 
Exercising rights under a pledge agreement, USRHC alleges
that on March 22 it removed all of the officers of Hotels Union
Square Mezz 1 LLC. Nonetheless, according to the complaint, the
incumbent officers went ahead and authorized the Chapter 11
filing on March 23. 
The complaint says that Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC has
a pledge of the ownership interest in the hotel itself. USRHC
said it will ask the bankruptcy judge to block a Chapter 11
filing for the hotel itself. 
A date for a hearing on a motion for a temporary injunction
hadn't been set by yesterday afternoon. HSRHC wants to prevent a
bankruptcy by the hotel to fend off a default on the $115
million first mortgage which is current. USRHC says income is
sufficient to pay operating expenses and debt service the first
mortgage. 
The case is In re Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC, 10-10971,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Neenah Submits Plan Negotiated Before February Filing 
Neenah Foundry Co., a producer of cast-iron products such
as manhole covers and sewer grates, filed a reorganization plan
and explanatory disclosure statement designed to bring
conclusion to the second venture into Chapter 11. 
Neenah filed under Chapter 11 on Feb. 3 after hashing out
agreement on a plan with holders of 55 percent of secured notes
and all the subordinated notes. 
The hearing for approval of the disclosure statement is
scheduled for April 27. 
The plan would exchange the $237.5 million outstanding on
9.5 percent senior secured notes for 97 percent of the new stock
plus a new $50 million secured loan. Tontine Capital Partners
LP, the controlling shareholder and holder of the $88.7 million
in 12.5 percent senior subordinated notes, is to have 3 percent
of the new equity plus warrants to purchase 10 percent. 
The draft disclosure statement has blanks where senior and
subordinated creditors ultimately will be told the predicted
percentage recovery. 
The $55.2 million secured working capital loan is to be
paid in full or reinstated. 
Trade suppliers are to be paid in full. The petition listed
assets of $287 million against debt totaling $449.1 million. 
Neenah was in Chapter 11 before. The company confirmed a
prepackaged plan in September 2003 that had been filed the
previous month. The plan exchanged senior subordinated notes for
$100 million in new subordinated debt, $30 million cash and half
of the stock. Trade creditors were paid in full. 
Neenah, from a Wisconsin town of the same name, reported a
$150 million net loss for the Sept. 30 fiscal year on net sales
of $333 million. In fiscal 2008, net sales were $511 million,
and the net loss was $12 million. 
The case is In re Neenah Enterprises Inc., 10-10360, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Lake at Las Vegas Scheduled for June 21 Confirmation 
Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC scheduled a June 21
confirmation hearing for approval of the Chapter 11 plan when
the bankruptcy judge this week approved the explanatory
disclosure statement. 
The committee representing unsecured creditors supports the
plan following an agreement with secured lenders owed $626
million. The committee believes that the plan has a better
outcome than success in a lawsuit against the lenders. 
The plan for the master developer of the Lake Las Vegas
Resort 17 miles from the Las Vegas Strip allows a lawsuit go to
forward against Sid Bass, Lee Bass and other former owners of
the project. Creditors drop the suit the committee began in July
against an affiliate of Credit Suisse Group AG, which was a
secured lender and agent for the secured creditors. 
The plan is to convert the secured lenders' $127 million
loan for the reorganization into 94 percent of the new equity.
For their more than $627 million in pre-bankruptcy secured
claims, the lenders will take 1 percent of the new equity,
warrants that currently would have no value, and 80 percent of
net recoveries from the lawsuit against the insiders. 
Unsecured creditors are expected to recover 4.5 percent
from a $1 million cash fund plus 20 percent of lawsuit
recoveries. 
Lot owners will waive claims in return for remapping
properties so they will have marketable title. 
The disclosure statement says that the plan is better for
unsecured creditors than victory in the lawsuit because the
creditors find no defects in the $127 million secured claim
financing the reorganization. The disclosure statement says that
the property is not worth enough to pay off the so-called DIP
loan. 
The suit contended that the loan from Credit Suisse in 2004
was a fraudulent transfer because all but $100 million from the
$560 million loan went directly to the owners. 
The formal lists of assets and liabilities showed $719
million in claims belonging to secured creditors, with the first
mortgage totaling $671 million. 
The development is a 3,600-acre master-planned community
with a 320-acre man-made lake next to the Lake Mead National
Recreational Area. It has three golf course, two hotels, a
casino, retail stores and more than 1,600 completed residential
units. The Chapter 11 filing was in July 2008. 
The case is Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC, 08-17814,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). 
Hawaii Medical Taps Gemino for Possible Financing 
Hawaii Medical Center LLC, the operator of two hospitals in
Honolulu, filed a motion on March 30 along with the creditors'
committee for authority to pay $75,000 in fees so Gemino
Healthcare Finance LLC will undertake the financial
investigation necessary to commit to provide $10 million in
financing for the hospitals' reorganization plan. 
Three plans have been competing for the right to reorganize
the hospitals. The bankruptcy judge already approved a
disclosure statement explaining the Chapter 11 plan proposed by
St. Francis Healthcare System of Hawaii. The St. Francis plan is
scheduled for a May 24 confirmation hearing. 
The bankruptcy judge has yet to give formal approval for
the disclosure statements accompanying the plans proposed by the
hospitals and the official creditors' committee. 
The hospitals say they need financing from Gemino to be in
place by May 23 so their plan could be confirmed instead of the
St. Francis plan on May 24. 
The hospitals originally filed for Chapter 11
reorganization in Delaware in August 2008. The cases were moved
to Hawaii in September 2008. The hospitals have 342 beds in
total. 
The case is CHA Hawaii LLC, 08-01369, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Hawaii (Honolulu). 
New Filings 
Medical Imaging Developer Eigen Files in Delaware 
Eigen Inc., a developer of technology to view and biopsy
prostate glands using three-dimensional ultrasound, filed a
Chapter 11 petition on March 30 in Delaware. 
The Grass Valley, California-based company owes more than
$20 million to the secured lender Kazi Management IV LLC.
Unsecured creditors are owed $1 million, with half representing
a claim held by General Electric Capital Corp. 
Before bankruptcy, Kazi was foreclosing. The foreclosure
was enjoined by a state court in California by former employees,
bankruptcy court papers say. 
Kazi is providing $2 million of new money financing for the
Chapter 11 case. 
The case is In re Eigen Inc., 10-11061, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
U.S. to Help Grant Forest Sale to Georgia-Pacific 
Grant Forest Products Inc., a Canada-based producer of
oriented strand board, filed a Chapter 15 petition late
yesterday in Delaware for protection from creditors in the U.S. 
Grant filed for reorganization in Ontario Superior Court in
June. The company has plants in Ontario, Alberta and South
Carolina. 
The petition said assets and debt both exceed $500 million.
Debt includes $398 million on first-lien obligations and $150
million on second-lien claims. 
The court in Canada already approved a sale of assets to
Georgia-Pacific LLC. The Chapter 15 case in part would assist in
implementation of the sale. 
If the bankruptcy judge in Delaware concludes that Canada
is home to the "foreign main proceeding," he will permanently
halt creditor actions in the U.S. and assist in implementation
of the Canadian reorganization. Most unsecured creditors in the
U.S. are not to be affected by the reorganization. 
The case is In re Grant Forest Products Inc., 10-11132,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Watch List 
Oil Producer Petroflow Has Problems with Lenders 
Petroflow Energy Ltd., an oil and natural gas production
company from Denver, was unable to sell the Oklahoma properties
by March 7. As a result, a forbearance agreement ended with bank
lenders, the company said in a statement yesterday. 
As a result, the banks terminated Petroflow's hedging
positions, generating $4.75 million that paid down the bank debt
to $98.75 million. The company said that the banks took
operational control of the primary operating accounts. 
Compounding the problems, Petroflow said a farmout
agreement was terminated for an alleged default. As a result,
purchasers are holding back payments, and liens have been placed
against the wells. 
Petroflow has yet to file audited financial statements for
2008 and 2009. The company said in the statement that the new
auditors expect to complete the filings in Canada by April 9. 
Petroflow said there is no assurance it can continue as a
going concern. 
The closing high for Petroflow's stock in the last two
years was $9.11 on June 17, 2008. In trading yesterday before
the announcement, the stock was above 26 cents. After the
announcement, the stock traded as low as 19 cents and closed at
22 cents, down 5 cents for the day.

Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay about
$400,000 to settle a lawsuit mid-trial that blamed its Neurontin
epilepsy medicine for helping cause a Massachusetts man&#8217;s
suicide, two people familiar with the accord said. 
It&#8217;s the first settlement over a Neurontin-related suicide
claim. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, agreed yesterday
to resolve allegations by Hartley Shearer&#8217;s family in Boston
federal court that its Warner-Lambert unit knew the drug posed a
suicide risk and failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. 
&#8220;Pfizer agreed to settle the case for less than its
defense costs remaining in this case,&#8221; said Rob Haralson, a
spokesman for New York-based Pfizer. &#8220;Pfizer maintains that it
has strong defenses to each of plaintiff&#8217;s claims.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. The settlement comes a week after
another Boston jury ordered Pfizer to pay more than $140 million
in damages to an insurer over the drug. Pfizer has denied any
wrongdoing in connection with its handling of Neurontin. 
Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a
$430 million fine. Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
For 16 Months 
The 57-year-old Shearer, a part-time lecturer at Williams
College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, took Neurontin for 16
months before killing himself, according to court filings. 
Shearer&#8217;s family contends his doctor wasn&#8217;t aware of
Neurontin&#8217;s suicide risk when he prescribed the drug to help
deal with pain generated by a 1999 stroke. 
Pfizer argued Shearer battled depression for most of his
life and was taking a dozen prescription drugs, including an
anti-depressant, when he shot himself to death with a .357
Magnum handgun in 2002. 
The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers also noted Shearer argued with his
wife the day he killed himself and left a suicide note saying it
was the last time she would &#8220;leave me powerless.&#8221; 
Ron Rosenkranz, a lawyer for the Shearers, declined to
comment when contacted yesterday evening. Today, he told U.S.
District Judge William G. Young at a hearing in Boston that the
&#8220;amount of the settlement, while confidential, is substantially
less than the amount reported.&#8221; 
&#8216;An Iffy Case&#8217; 
&#8220;This is an iffy case,&#8221; Young told jurors after
announcing the accord. &#8220;This is why they settled. Iffy on both
sides.&#8221; The people who said the settlement was about $400,000
declined to be identified because the terms are confidential. 
By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Shearer&#8217;s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. 
Dr. Charles King, a former Harvard University business
professor, told jurors in the Shearer case yesterday that
Warner-Lambert officials used illegal off-label marketing
tactics to turn Neurontin into a &#8220;blockbuster drug.&#8221; 
&#8220;They took a drug that was expected to generate
$500 million over its lifetime and turned it into a drug that
sold roughly $10 billion,&#8221; said King, an economist who
testified for the Shearers as an expert on pharmaceutical-
industry marketing practices. 
The Shearer suit was the second product-liability case over
Neurontin to go to trial. 
In July 2009, a Peabody, Massachusetts, family dropped its
suit over the suicide of a woman who was taking the drug. The
family was in the second day of trial in federal court in Boston
when it decided to dismiss the case. 
Misleading Doctors 
Another jury in Boston&#8217;s federal court March 25 said Pfizer
must pay Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. $47.4 million for
misleading doctors on whether Neurontin was effective for
illnesses such as migraines and bipolar disorder. 
The jury found the drugmaker violated the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, and
California&#8217;s Unfair Competition Law. 
The Oakland, California-based insurer is a unit of Kaiser
Permanente, the largest U.S. nonprofit health maintenance
organization. Under RICO, the amount of actual damages will be
tripled to $142.1 million. 
Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in 2000 and
Pharmacia for $54 billion three years later. 
$430 Million Settlement 
Along with the $430 million settlement of allegations over
Neurontin, Pfizer also paid $2.3 billion in October 2009 to
resolve U.S. Justice Department allegations it illegally
marketed the painkiller Bextra and three other drugs. 
&#8220;When you acquire Warner-Lambert you get Neurontin, and
when you acquire Pharmacia you get Bextra, and some of these
problems came with the acquisitions,&#8221; Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer&#8217;s
chief executive officer told the New York Times March 31. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t change the facts or our responsibility for them.&#8221; 
The Shearer case is Shearer v. Pfizer Inc., 07-cv-11428-

A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. buyout
firm bought a minority stake in David Ganek&#8217;s $4 billion Level
Global Investors LP, adding a hedge fund that can bet on rising
as well as falling stock prices globally. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Petershill Fund Offshore LP, a $1 billion
fund set up to buy minority stakes in hedge funds, won&#8217;t get any
management or investment decision-making role with the
acquisition, according to a letter Ganek sent to clients
yesterday. New York-based Level Global said it will use the
proceeds from the sale to help attract and retain top talent. 
&#8220;We believe this investment by Petershill is an important
milestone in the continued development of Level Global&#8217;s
investment management platform as an institutional quality
business,&#8221; Ganek and managing partner Anthony Chiasson said in
the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Ganek, an alumnus of Steven A. Cohen&#8217;s Stamford,
Connecticut-based SAC Capital Advisors LLC, founded Level Global
in 2003. The firm has 64 employees, of which 25 are investment
professionals. Petershill has interests in three London-based
funds, Capula Investment Management LLP, Winton Capital
Management Ltd. and Trafalgar Asset Managers Ltd., as well as in
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Shumway Capital Partners LLC. 
Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Level Global, and Melissa
Daly, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment. 
Hedge funds are loosely regulated private partnerships that

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. aren't doing "God's work" when it comes
to derivatives, according to investor groups of nuns and
priests. 
Shareholders will vote starting this month on proposals
sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and 14
other religious organizations, asking Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to give more
information on the collateral used in their derivatives trading. 
It's the first time the four banks, among the largest U.S.
swaps dealers, will put to a nonbinding vote a call to explain
how collateral of derivatives customers is used and to keep it
from other accounts. Congress is considering bills that would
require more derivatives deals be processed through
clearinghouses, privately owned third parties that guarantee
transactions and keep track of collateral and margin. 
"The use of these instruments, if they're not disclosed by
the dealers and the information made available, by their very
nature can contribute to systemic risk," said Father Seamus
Finn, a director with the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate
in Washington, D.C., one of the co-sponsors of the resolutions. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in February
and March decisions, backed the religious groups' bid to put the
proposal up for a vote by shareholders of JPMorgan, Bank of
America and Citigroup. New York-based Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, agreed separately to add
the resolution to its proxy statement. 
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein's
remark in November that he's a banker doing "God's work" was
an "inscrutable comment," Finn said. "He was part of a group
of very senior people from the banking sector who appeared to
have been advised by their PR people to acknowledge their
mistakes but more pointedly assert the uprightness of their
intentions." 
The ICCR 
Blankfein, 55, didn't mean for the remark to be taken
seriously, Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said that
month. 
The religious groups, members of the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, hold shares in the four banks ranging
from 100 at Goldman Sachs to 63,977 at Citigroup. The New York-
based ICCR's 300 members include money managers for various
religious organizations, including Jewish and Buddhist, and
pension and mutual funds that oversee $100 billion in assets,
according to the organization's Web site. 
"The immorality of the financial crisis is rooted in the
fact that these derivatives contracts weren't based on creating
value and didn't create incentives for people to keep their
promises," said Laura Berry, a former large-cap portfolio
manager for Citigroup who is executive director of the ICCR,
which is coordinating the proxy votes for the religious groups. 
200 Proposals 
ICCR's members have placed 200 social and environmental
measures on proxy ballots this year, including the use of
antibiotics in animal feed at Tyson Foods Inc. and carbon
emissions at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Berry said. The organization
filed its first shareholder resolution in 1971, pressuring
General Motors Corp. to divest from South Africa because of what
was then the country's apartheid policy of racial segregation. 
"They do very good work," said Charles Elson, director of
the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware. "I don't always agree with them, but
some of the stuff they've done is quite good." 
JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and
Morgan Stanley were parties to 96 percent of the $293 trillion
in over-the-counter derivatives trades made by the top 25 U.S.
bank-holding companies as of Dec. 31, according to the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency. The religious groups didn't
seek to place a resolution on Morgan Stanley's proxy because
none have held the bank's shares long enough, said Finn. 
Banks Say Reject 
The religious organizations want the four broker-dealers to
disclose internal policies on how the collateral posted by
derivatives customers is used. They're also asking the lenders
to segregate the collateral from other accounts, which would
prohibit it from being used for anything else. 
"We were very much concerned about where's the collateral,
is this all recorded, do we know who the second or third party
is to this, the counterparties and so on," said Sister Barbara
Aires, coordinator of corporate responsibility at the Sisters of
Charity of Saint Elizabeth, in Convent Station, New Jersey. 
The banks have urged shareholders in their proxy
statements to reject the proposal. JPMorgan said that
segregating assets could expose it to price volatility and
potential losses "when the firm needs to liquidate collateral
quickly upon a default." 
JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli, Goldman Sachs
spokesman Michael DuVally, Bank of America spokesman Scott
Silvestri and Citigroup spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to
comment beyond the companies' proxy statements. 
Proposals focusing on specific business issues like
derivatives trading "tend not to do well" in shareholder
votes, said Elson. "They're really issues of the board. But in
this climate, you can't say anything is for sure."

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and other banks objected to
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s plan to build its real estate
unit into an asset-management business. 
The business would be &#8220;a reorganization plan for debtors&#8217;
employees and management separate, apart and ahead of the
reorganization plan for creditors,&#8221; the banks said yesterday in
a court filing. 
A unit called Lamco, staffed by current employees and
managers, would run the defunct investment bank&#8217;s real estate
and private-equity assets, also taking on business from outside,
Lehman said in March. 
The Lehman parent would have sole control and ownership of
the assets, denying &#8220;any governance or ownership interest&#8221; to
affiliates that helped to fund Lamco, or to creditors, the banks
said. They described the proposed Lamco deal as an &#8220;insider
transaction,&#8221; not an &#8220;arms-length sale.&#8221; 
The objection was filed by seven banks and two investment
companies that are derivatives creditors of a Lehman affiliate,
including Merrill Lynch  Co., its parent Bank of America Corp.
and Deutsche Bank AG. By putting Lehman managers and employees
ahead of creditors, Lamco would turn the Chapter 11
reorganization &#8220;on its head,&#8221; they said. 
Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment. 
Lehman&#8217;s U.K. units objected to the plan in a separate
filing, saying Lehman hadn&#8217;t provided enough information to
assess its merits. 
A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for April 14 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

The banks said the planned business would be "a

Microsoft Corp. failed to persuade a
U.S. appeals court to take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change the company's popular
Word software and resulted in a damage award that has grown to
more than $290 million. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April
1 rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. 
Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. 
I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. 
Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. 
The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). 
Amazon.com Gets U.S. Patent for Order Tracking by Video 
Amazon.com Inc., the largest online retailer, received a
patent for video tracking of order processing. 
Patent 7,689,465, issued March 30, covers the capture of
images of an order being processed, and the sending of those
images to the customer. 
The technology can also be used to notify third parties,
who pay to have their promotional material included in a
shipment, according to the patent. A customer will be able to
see her own name and address put on the order, and what is
included in the order, before it is shipped. 
The invention also may be used to verify customer
complaints about an order, according to the patent. 
Amazon applied for the patent in March 2005 with assistance
from Meyertons, Hood, Kivlin, Kowert  Goetzel PC of Austin,
Texas. 
New Zealand Lawmakers Propose Barring Software Patents 
New Zealand lawmakers are considering changing that
country's patent code to outlaw software patents. 
Parliament's Commerce Select Committee made its final
recommendation in a 197-page report released at the end of
March. 
The committee said the patenting of software is
"inconsistent" with the open-source model. Permitting software
patents would "stifle innovation and competition," the
committee said in its report. 
The report noted that the issue of embedded software is
problematic and urged the Intellectual Property Office of New
Zealand to develop guidelines for inventions containing embedded
software. 
In addition to software, the new law would ban the
patenting of plant varieties, human beings and biological
processes for their generation, methods of treating humans by
surgery and therapy, and methods of diagnosis practiced on human
beings. 
New Zealand's present patent law, enacted in 1953, was
based on a 1949 U.K. patent bill that has since been repealed. 
Existing New Zealand patent law "has a low threshold for
patentability compared with most other countries," according to
the committee's report. This low threshold "can lead to broader
patent rights" in New Zealand than in other countries. 
As a result, technology that may be freely available in
other countries may be protected by patents in New Zealand.
Lawmakers said this has the potential to discourage innovation
and inhibit growth in productivity and exports.

EBay Wins Tiffany Trademark Appeal, Faces Ad Claim 
EBay Inc. didn't infringe Tiffany  Co.'s trademark because
of fake goods sold on its Web site, an appeals court ruled,
while returning Tiffany's lawsuit to the trial court for further
action on a false-advertising claim. 
EBay's ads promoting Tiffany merchandise may be misleading
and in violation of federal law, the New York-based appeals
court said April 1. 
"The law prohibits an advertisement that implies that all
of the goods offered on a defendant's Web site are genuine when,
in fact, as here, a sizeable portion of them are not," a three-
judge panel wrote. 
The ruling may force EBay to change its advertising policy
to include disclaimers that some trademark goods, like Tiffany
jewelry, may be counterfeit. The judges said they "rather doubt
that the consequences will be so dire" that advertising will be
deterred because sellers can't confirm the authenticity of goods
for sale as EBay maintained. 
Tiffany said in a statement that it is "very
disappointed" by the ruling and considering an appeal. 
"EBay knew that counterfeit merchandise was being sold on
its site -- and EBay took no effective steps to stop it,"
Tiffany Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Kowalski said in the
statement. "EBay deliberately misled consumers for profit, and
unfortunately the court has justified its actions." 
Tiffany, based in New York, and other retailers have said
online sales of fake brands of clothes, bags and jewelry cost
the industry about $30 billion a year. EBay, the most-visited
U.S. e-commerce site, said the ruling validates its "leading
efforts to fight counterfeiting." 
"We continue to support cooperation, rather than
litigation, as the best way to address these issues in
everyone's best interests," Michael R. Jacobson, general
counsel of the San Jose, California-based company, said in a
statement, predicting an EBay victory on the false-ad claim. 
The case is Tiffany v. EBay, 08-3947, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).

Boeing Ready With Tanker Bid, Has Trademark Application 
Boeing Co., whose quest to gain the U.S. Air Force's $35
billion air-tanker contract was set back with the extension of
the bidding deadline to July 9, already has a pending
application for a trademark for the aircraft. 
Chicago-based Boeing, which is presently the only known
bidder for the contract, applied to register "KC-767" as a
trademark in March 2006, according to the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. The mark is to be used for
aircraft, Boeing said in its application. 
According to the designations-systems.net Web site, the Air
Force approved the KC-767 in September 2002 for a Boeing tanker
based on its 767 aircraft. Boeing is the maker of the KC-135
tanker the Air Force first ordered in 1954, which the new tanker
is intended to replace. 
The Department of Defense said March 31 it was extending
the bidding deadline to July 9 if the European Aeronautic
Defence and Space Co. decides to submit a bid. Netherlands-based
EADS asked for an extension after partner Northrop Grumman Corp.
dropped out of the competition on March 8, saying the bidding
contest favored the Boeing aircraft. 
Knoll Settles 'Barcelona' Trademark Dispute with Alphaville 
Knoll Inc., a maker of office furniture, settled a
trademark dispute with Alphaville Design Inc., according to a
company statement. 
Alphaville, a furniture wholesaler based in Fremont,
California, sued Knoll in federal court in San Francisco in
November 2007, seeking a declaration it wasn't infringing the
"Barcelona" trademarks used for furniture designed by Mies van
der Rohe. 
The California company claimed Knoll's trademarks were
invalid. In settling the dispute, Alphaville and its owners
acknowledged the validity of the trademarks and Knoll's rights
to them. 
In return, East Greenville, Pennsylvania-based Knoll
granted Alphaville the right to sell similar products for a
limited amount of time, according to the statement. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel signed the dismissal
order on March 29. No damages, litigation costs or attorney fees
were awarded to either party, according to the order. 
The case is Alphaville Design Inc., v. Knoll Inc. 3:07-cv-
0569-MHP, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).

General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, said it will wind down its Hummer brand and is
offering rebates of as much as $6,000 to sell remaining sport-
utility vehicles. 
Jim Bunnell, GM's general director for dealer network
support, told retailers in conference call at 11:45 a.m. Detroit
time that they will get letters within days about ending their
franchises, Nick Richards, a company spokesman, said in an
interview. 
Shedding Hummer was part of GM's plan to pare its U.S.
brands to four from eight after bankruptcy. GM has sold one of
the four brands it explored selling. 
"Anyone who buys it needs cash to make it work," said Jim
Hall, principal of 2953 Analytics, a consulting firm in
Birmingham, Michigan. "That's why GM has been turning buyers
away left, right and center." 
GM is winding down Saturn after a planned sale to Penske
Automotive Group Inc. fell through in September. It reversed
plans to sell its European Opel unit to Canadian supplier Magna
International Inc. in November. Detroit-based GM sold Saab in
February only after two attempts to sell the Swedish carmaker
failed. Pontiac is also being closed.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
energy company, said it never deliberately underpaid royalties
on natural gas pumped on federal and American Indian land. 
The U.S. Justice Department yesterday announced that Exxon
agreed to pay $32.2 million to resolve violations of the False
Claims Act committed between March 1988 and November 1999. Mobil
Corp., which was acquired by Exxon in December 1999,
"systematically underreported" the value of gas extracted from
the leases and "knowingly" underpaid what it owed, the
department said in a statement. 
"We reject any accusation that the company deliberately
under-reported the value of the natural gas," David Eglinton, a
spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mailed
statement. "The settlement agreement in this case, signed by
the government, expressly denies any knowing under-reporting
with respect to royalty." 
Eglinton said the agreement was signed in 2008. The Justice
Department's statement didn't explain why it waited until now to
announce the settlement. 
The amount Exxon agreed to pay is equivalent to less than
one hour of the company's sales. 
The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Harold Wright
under the provisions of the federal whistleblower statute that
allows private citizens to file actions on behalf of the
government and share in any recovery. Because Wright is deceased,
his heirs will receive $975,000, the Justice Department said. 
Other energy companies that previously settled similar
cases with the government include Burlington Resources Inc.,
which is now part of ConocoPhillips, Chevron Corp. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, the department said. 
The dispute centered on whether the energy companies could
deduct costs such as pipeline fees from the value of the gas.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. has almost
doubled the number of its Tokyo commodity traders to meet demand
from utilities seeking to use coal-derivatives to hedge against
price swings, said a person with knowledge of the expansion. 
The second-biggest U.S. bank has increased the headcount to
around 10 in the last 18 months, in part to meet the needs of
utilities such as Chubu Electric Power Co. and J-Power, the
country&#8217;s biggest power wholesaler, said the person, who
declined to be named because the information is private. 
JPMorgan joins Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc in
boosting sales of swaps and other products to help Japanese
utilities mitigate risk from volatile fuel costs. J-Power&#8217;s
profit dropped by a third in fiscal 2008 and Chubu posted a loss
after benchmark Australian power-station coal prices rose to a
record in July then fell 61 percent five months later. 
&#8220;Utilities&#8217; hedging needs have grown rapidly over the past
few years as physical coal prices became more volatile,&#8221; said
Ken Hasegawa, the energy team manager at broker Newedge in Tokyo.
&#8220;The question is whether other power companies will follow
suit.&#8221; 
Mika Nemoto, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Securities Japan
Co., declined to comment. 
J-Power, officially known as Electric Power Development Co.,
hired Barclays commodities banker Toyohiko Kuroda last year to
bolster management of risks associated with coal procurement,
Masato Uchiyama, director of the utility&#8217;s energy business
division, said in an interview on April 6. 
Coal Swaps 
The utility, which buys 20 million metric tons of coal
annually, transacts coal swaps for part of that total to hedge
against price fluctuations, said Uchiyama, 54. 
Swaps allow utilities to pay a fixed price for coal while
another party, usually a bank, pays a floating price, based on
market benchmarks. If the benchmark goes up during the term of
the contract, the utility gets a payment from the bank, and if
it goes down, the utility pays. 
Nagoya-based Chubu Electric transacted 15 million tons
worth of over-the-counter coal swaps free on board at
Australia&#8217;s Newcastle port in the year ended March 31 after
forming an alliance with a unit of Electricite de France SA in
2007, said Yoshio Komura, director of Chubu&#8217;s trading unit. 
Japan&#8217;s third-biggest generator formed Chubu Energy Trading
Inc. in 2007 to procure the fuel for resale to other users in
Asia and trade derivatives, Komura said. 
Spot power-station coal prices at Newcastle, the world&#8217;s
largest export harbor for the fuel, retreated to an average
$71.71 a ton in 2009 from $129.02 the previous year as the
global economic recession eroded demand. Prices climbed to a
record $192.50 in July before plunging to $75.25 in Dec. 5, 2008.
Coal gained 14 cents to $94.98 a ton in the week ended April 3,
according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index. 
Japan, the world&#8217;s biggest power-station coal importer in
2009, ships in about 92 million tons annually. Australian
suppliers led by Xstrata Plc and Rio Tinto Plc account for more
than half while Indonesia, the second-biggest supplier, provides
about 20 percent, according to the finance ministry.

Ali Hedayat, co-head in the Americas
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s largest internal hedge fund, has
left the firm, the second senior departure from the unit in less
than a month, said three people familiar with the matter. 
Hedayat&#8217;s departure follows last month&#8217;s exit by Pierre
Henri Flamand, who ran the Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies
division from London. Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York, declined to comment. Hedayat, 35, who was promoted
to managing director in October 2006, also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, generates about 10 percent of its revenue from
proprietary trading, or bets with the firm&#8217;s own money, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar has said. Goldman Sachs Principal
Strategies, a unit within the firm&#8217;s equities division,
rebounded from losses in 2008 to fuel the firm&#8217;s 7 percent gain
in equity revenue to $9.89 billion in 2009, according to the
company&#8217;s earnings report in January. 
Principal strategies seeks to profit from discrepancies in
relative values of financial instruments, convertible bonds and
&#8220;various types of volatility trading,&#8221; according to the
report. In early 2008, a group of traders from principal
strategies led by Raanan Agus and Kenneth Ebert created a $7
billion hedge fund called Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and
became part of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
Flamand, 39, is setting up his own hedge fund and a Goldman
Sachs executive in London said last month that the firm supports
Flamand&#8217;s plan. 
Hedayat, who graduated from McGill University in Montreal
in 1996 with a double major in finance and economics, started at
Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a financial analyst covering Latin
American markets. He joined the principal strategies group in
2000 and moved to the London office in 2002, before returning to
New York in 2007.

International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, is offering
financing to partners of Sun Microsystems Inc., the server-
computer maker acquired by IBM rival Oracle Corp. this year. 
As much as $500 million will be available for Sun partners
who switch to selling IBM systems -- integrated servers,
software and storage -- to their clients, Armonk, New York-based
IBM said today in a statement. 
IBM has won over some Sun resellers and is trying to get
more with the financing perk, said Bernie Spang, IBM&#8217;s director
of strategy for information-management software. The company had
sought to buy Sun last year, according to people familiar with
the matter. That bid dissolved after the companies disagreed on
price and terms. 
&#8220;The goal of this effort is to sweeten the pot,&#8221; Spang
said. 
Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. The company completed its purchase
of Sun in January for about $7.4 billion. IBM trails Microsoft
Corp. and Oracle in software sales. 
IBM also unveiled a new system that helps analyze data 20
times faster for industries such as finance and health care.
Last quarter, the company introduced its new Power7 systems,
which are tailored for specific projects. 
IBM rose 8 cents to $129.01 at 2:14 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had fallen 1.5 percent
this year before today.

positions were not a &#8216;bet against&#8217; our clients,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn wrote
in a letter introducing the firm&#8217;s annual report. 
Goldman Sachs has been criticized for its role in the
subprime mortgage-securities market and as a trading partner to
American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out by the
U.S. government. Harris Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate
reputations found that 60 percent of respondents gave Goldman
Sachs negative ratings for &#8220;ethical standards.&#8221; Only AIG,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac scored lower. 
Goldman Sachs posted $11.6 billion profit for fiscal 2007,
a record at the time, aided by bets that the subprime mortgage
market would decline even as clients continued to purchase the
securities. U.S. home prices have slumped 28 percent from their
all-time high in July 2006, spurring the worst recession since
the 1930s. 
&#8220;The firm did not generate enormous net revenues or
profits by betting against residential mortgage-related
products,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote. &#8220;Our relatively early
risk reduction resulted in our losing less money than we
otherwise would have when the residential housing market began
to deteriorate rapidly.&#8221; 
Taxpayer Aid 
The New York-based firm received $10 billion of taxpayer
aid in the credit crisis, which it repaid in June. That money
led politicians and pundits to blame Goldman Sachs for profiting
from taxpayers. Labor unions led protests calling for bonus
payments to be canceled, and a Rolling Stone magazine writer
last year labeled the firm a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity&#8221; and criticized it for selling
securities backed by subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs is grateful for the indispensible role
governments played and we recognize that our firm and our
shareholders benefitted from it,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
&#8220;It is impossible to know what would have happened to the
financial system absent concerted government action around the
world.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said AIG&#8217;s bailout in 2008 helped the bank
and every other financial institution, because the insurer&#8217;s
collapse would have been &#8220;extremely&#8221; disruptive to financial
markets, Blankfein said. 
The $182.3 billion bailout ensured that Goldman Sachs and
other counterparties were repaid in full. Much of the $12.9
billion Goldman Sachs received from the insurer&#8217;s rescue was
paid out to meet AIG-related &#8216;obligations,&#8221; the firm said. 
Goldman Sachs had &#8220;minimal&#8221; economic exposure to AIG
after it demanded collateral and insured against a default
through the credit default swaps market, Blankfein said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s railway fund
is betting on U.S. freight companies such as Union Pacific Corp.,
CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., following Warren Buffett&#8217;s
decision to take over Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. 
The 138 billion yen ($1.5 billion) JPM Global Railway Stock
Fund expects the companies to benefit from a move to carrying
goods by rail instead of roads to reduce fuel costs and
pollution, said Peter Kirkman, the fund&#8217;s lead portfolio manager.
Railroads burn less diesel than trucks for each ton of cargo
carried, giving operators a fuel-efficiency advantage. 
&#8220;Government policy will continue to move toward
environmental concerns,&#8221; Kirkman, who works for J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc., said in a telephone interview from
New York yesterday. &#8220;Moving freight by train rather than road
is highly advantageous.&#8221; 
Purchasing stakes in the U.S. rail companies has helped the
fund gain 11 percent in value since its January start and beat
the advances in Japan&#8217;s Topix Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. The fund, which has 19.8 percent of its holdings in the
U.S., was started Jan. 26 and is sold only in Japan. 
U.S. rail&#8217;s prospects spurred Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. last year to agree to spend $27 billion to buy 77.4 percent
of Burlington Northern it didn&#8217;t own. 
President Barack Obama earlier this year granted $8 billion
for 13 high-speed train corridors across the U.S., including a
portion to improve existing rail lines. 
Economic Rebound 
Union Pacific, the U.S. railroad with the biggest
locomotive fleet, is predicting growth in freight this year amid
more demand for transporting commodities as the U.S. economy
returned to growth. 
North American railroad volume, considered a leading
indicator for economic conditions, has gained 1.5 percent in the
year to March 27, according to the Association of American
Railroads, rebounding from a 16.2 percent slump last year. 
&#8220;There are only four major players and so it&#8217;s a fairly
small market,&#8221; Kirkman said. &#8220;Freight transport will continue
to grow.&#8221; 
Union Pacific fell 0.2 percent to $73.64 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. It has gained 15 percent
this year. CSX has gained 8.2 percent this year while Norfolk
Southern has advanced 9.9 percent. 
The fund doesn&#8217;t have a benchmark. Its gains compare with an
8.7 percent increase in the Topix index and a 9.5 percent
advance in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s head of
environmental commodities including carbon emissions, Gerrit
Nicholas, has left the firm, according to a bank official
briefed on the decision. 
Rich Sberlati, a vice president at the New York-based
securities firm, will become head of North American
environmental commodities, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced. Goldman
Sachs spokesman Melissa Daly declined to comment. Nicholas
couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. 
Banks including Goldman Sachs, London-based Barclays Plc
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. have been monitoring negotiations on
U.S. climate-change legislation, which stalled in the Senate,
dampening prospects for a &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; market for carbon-
dioxide emissions. The firms are seeking to play a key role in
any new nationwide system. 
Carbon allowances in a smaller trading program running in
10 Northeastern states fell 41 percent in 2009 and 7.4 percent
this year. The decline reflects, in part, uncertainty about the
outcome of climate-change talks, said Kedin Kilgore, named in
January to head Barclays Capital&#8217;s carbon-trading business. 
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough guidance out of D.C. to know if we
will have a confirmed trading program this year and whether a
federal program will fully supersede any regional program,&#8221;
Kilgore, head of U.S. emissions trading at Barclays unit, said
in an interview. 
The U.S. carbon market has the potential to surge to more
than $300 billion by 2020, according to Point Carbon, an Oslo-
based firm that analyzes environmental markets.

Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the
lender to the owners of Florida&#8217;s Sawgrass Marriott Resort,
asked a bankruptcy court for permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. 
Goldman yesterday asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn
in Jacksonville, Florida, to lift the automatic stay, a part of
the bankruptcy code that shields a company from creditors&#8217;
efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs Mortgage is a
division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Goldman, owed about $193 million, claims the company no
longer has a stake in the property and can&#8217;t restructure its
debts. 
&#8220;The resort property that is the subject of this
bankruptcy is worth less than the amount of the debt, and there
is clearly no equity in the property,&#8221; lawyers for the lender
said in court papers. 
RQB Resort LP, which filed bankruptcy March 1 to stop a
prior foreclosure action by Goldman, owns the 65-acre resort in
Ponte Vedra Beach that is home to the TPC Sawgrass golf club
where the U.S. PGA Tour&#8217;s Players Championship is held, court
papers show. Affiliate RQB Development also sought protection. 
In July 2006, Goldman helped finance RQB Resort and RQB
Development&#8217;s $220.5 million purchase of the property, court
papers show. RQB representatives met Goldman in March 2009 and
said that they might have &#8220;liquidity issues&#8221; by August. 
Negotiation Effort 
In June, the owners hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP to
broker a solution with Goldman. After almost three months of
negotiating, the owners believed that Perella had fashioned an
agreement on a restructuring except for one issue, according to
court documents. In October, Goldman told the owners it intended
to foreclose, the resort owner said. 
&#8220;When asked in early November why the restructuring was no
longer an alternative, Goldman Sachs stated that its management
had changed its mind and preferred to own the resort,&#8221; RQB said
in court papers. 
RQB Resort is the exclusive partner to the PGA Tour&#8217;s
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, known as TPC Sawgrass,
court papers show. The 508-room hotel resort has rights to
85 percent of the starting times each day to the Players Stadium
Course through 2089. 
Tiger Woods made his Feb. 19 apology for his marital
infidelity at the TPC Sawgrass golf club. 
The course was ranked ninth on Golf Digest&#8217;s list of
America&#8217;s 100 Greatest Public Courses for 2009-2010. The TPC
Sawgrass is known for its 17th hole, where World Golf Hall of
Fame architect Peter Dye placed the green on an island in a
small lake. 
The Masters Tournament started today, with Phil Mickelson,
Lee Westwood, Yong-Eun Yang, and 60-year-old Tom Watson tied for
the early lead at 5-under par. Woods, the No. 1 golfer in the
Official World Ranking, is 1-under par through the first 6
holes. 
The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville).

GSW Immobilien AG, a German property
company owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cerberus Capital
Management LP, aims to raise about 140 million euros ($187
million) in an initial public offering. 
The Berlin-based joint venture will offer as much as 15
percent on top of the base amount, according to terms of the
deal obtained by Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank
AG are managing the sale, which is scheduled for the second
quarter, as joint global coordinators. 
The company aims for a free float of at least 49.9 percent
of the stock after the IPO in a primary and secondary share
sale. The amount to be raised from the secondary offering has
yet to be confirmed, according to the term sheet. 
The offering comes after German companies raised 1.7
billion euros from IPOs in March, the biggest amount since July
2007, Bloomberg data show. Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, the
country&#8217;s largest cable company, sold 759 million euros of stock
and chemicals distributor Brenntag AG raised 748 million euros. 
GSW was sold by the city of Berlin to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Whitehall Funds unit and Cerberus, the U.S. investment fund, for
almost 2 billion euros in 2004. 
The company&#8217;s 49,700 properties have space of about 3.1
million square meters (33.4 million square feet) and were valued
at about 2.6 billion euros at the end of last year, according to
a statement today. GSW also manages another 17,000 homes.

Coca-Cola Co. has started testing a
reduced-sugar soft drink in Germany, preparing a second attack
on Bionade GmbH, the organic drinks maker that has rejected
takeover bids from the world&#8217;s largest beverage producer. 
Coca-Cola has been testing consumer reaction to a naturally
fruit-flavored soft drink called Tumult since February in about
40 Alex bar-restaurants owned by British pub operator Mitchells
 Butlers Plc. A 0.33-liter bottle of Tumult costs 2.80 euros
($3.72), 20 cents more than a bottle of Fanta or Coke. 
Tumult is Coca-Cola&#8217;s second swipe at Bionade, which with a
6 percent market share is Germany&#8217;s third-largest non-cola soft
drink brand behind Coke&#8217;s Fanta and Sprite. Coca-Cola in 2008
introduced Spirit of Georgia, with &#8220;less sugar and carbonic
acid&#8221; than rival sodas, according to its Web site. 
&#8220;Tumult is addressing adult consumers, and we will examine
the drink&#8217;s acceptance in the coming months,&#8221; said Kristina
Brehm, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in Germany. The drink hasn&#8217;t
been officially announced, she said. 
Coca-Cola has made approaches to buy Bionade, according to
the company&#8217;s co-owner and Chief Executive Officer Peter
Kowalsky. The Atlanta-based beverage producer made an offer
worth &#8220;hundreds of millions,&#8221; he said in an interview in 2007.
Dr. August Oetker KG, the family company that owns Germany&#8217;s
largest brewery, bought a majority stake in Bionade last year. 
Brehm declined to comment about offers for Bionade. 
Spirit of Georgia 
Spirit of Georgia had less than 1 percent market share last
year in the German non-cola soft drinks market, which is worth
about 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to data
provided by the country&#8217;s industry group for non-alcoholic
beverages. 
&#8220;Organic soft drinks have shown an above-average growth
pace in the past and I expect the segment to continue growing in
the future,&#8221; Detlef Gross, head of the industry group, said. 
Bionade&#8217;s drinks are made through a fermentation process
that generates gluconic acid, which is found naturally in honey
and fruit, rather than alcohol, according to the company&#8217;s Web
site. Bionade says it uses only natural ingredients, and its
drinks carry the seal of the European Union&#8217;s organic food
control board. 
Bionade is being offered in five different flavors while
Spirit of Georgia is available in three. Tumult, which uses some
fermented ingredients, is currently being sold in a &#8220;fruity&#8221;
and a &#8220;bittersweet&#8221; variety. 
Ostheim, Germany-based Bionade, which was founded in 1985
and had forecast turnover of as many as 230 million bottles in
2009, isn&#8217;t concerned about the potential new competitor,
Kowalsky said. None of the more than 30 rival products on the
German market has lowered its own market share, he added. 
Bionade, which generates the major part of revenue in its
domestic market, aims to accelerate international expansion, the
executive said. In neighboring Austria, the beverage is being
served in bars and restaurants and is sold in organic grocery
stores. The company is currently hiring vendors in what Kowalsky
calls &#8220;trendsetter cities&#8221; including Barcelona and San
Francisco, where Bionade is available in more than 100 bars.

&#8220;isn&#8217;t an insurer,&#8221; Bernheim was also cited as saying.
Bernheim hasn&#8217;t decided whether to accept an offer to become
honorary chairman because it doesn&#8217;t involve having a seat on
the board, according to the report. 
The new board will be voted in at the insurer&#8217;s annual

Generali, Italy&#8217;s largest insurer.

China&#8217;s March trade deficit is
temporary and the pressure for the yuan to gain remains intact,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;The weak exports in March were likely due to the Lunar
New Year effects as exporters suspend production for an extended
period after the holiday,&#8221; wrote Hong Kong-based analysts Song
Yu and Helen Qiao in a report on April 10. &#8220;Given the strong
underlying exports growth and rising overheating pressures, we
believe a modest yuan revaluation is still on the agenda.&#8221; 
China posted its first trade deficit in six years in March,
even as the yuan remained pegged to the dollar. Exports gained
24 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 46 percent in
February. Imports jumped 66 percent last month from the same
period last year, compared to a 45 percent increase in February.
This resulted in $7.24 billion shortfall, versus the median
forecast for a $390 million deficit in a Bloomberg News survey. 
China&#8217;s yuan traded at 6.8248 per dollar as of 9:33 a.m. in
Shanghai versus 6.8239 on April 9, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. The central bank has kept the
currency around 6.83 since July 2008. 
Goldman on April 1 raised its three- and six-month
projections for the yuan to reflect expectations the currency
will be allowed to strengthen this quarter. It predicted the
yuan will appreciate to 6.74 per dollar by the end of June and
6.66 by the end of September. 
Policy makers will probably allow appreciation to resume by
widening the currency&#8217;s trading band versus the dollar to 1
percent, from 0.5 percent, and commencing a &#8220;downward crawl&#8221;
of the central bank&#8217;s reference rate, Goldman said on April 1.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, fell the most in three weeks in
New York trading after a newsletter report that Simon Property
Group Inc. may abandon a takeover bid for its smaller rival. 
Simon, based in Indianapolis, is unlikely to move ahead
with its buyout offer because of antitrust concerns, the REIT
Newshound reported last night, citing sources it didn&#8217;t
identify. Simon has concluded that an attorney for Chicago-based
General Growth who deals with antitrust issues wasn&#8217;t dealing in
&#8220;good faith,&#8221; the newsletter said, citing one of the sources. 
Les Morris, a spokesman for Simon Property, declined to
comment. David Keating, a General Growth spokesman, didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. 
General Growth fell 3.6 percent to $16.13 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest drop since March 23. The
shares have jumped 72 percent since Feb. 15, the day before
Simon made public a $10 billion offer to buy the company out of
bankruptcy. General Growth dismissed the bid as too low and
instead plans to exit bankruptcy with financing from a group led
by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
&#8220;GGP shares were priced based on some sort of topping from
Simon,&#8221; said Benjamin Yang, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette 
Woods in San Francisco. &#8220;Based on this news, it seems less
likely that Simon will come back with an offer higher than the
$15-a-share proposal from Brookfield.&#8221; 
General Growth filed the biggest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history almost a year ago after amassing $27 billion in
debt making acquisitions. Simon&#8217;s bid would have given equity
investors about $9 a share and paid unsecured creditors in full. 
Simon has been preparing a new offer for General Growth, a
person with knowledge of the plan told Bloomberg News last
month.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, is courting
endowment heads to join its asset-management group, according to
three people with knowledge of the search. 
The company started approaching chief investment officers
at endowments, as well as money managers that oversee such
assets, late last year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the search isn&#8217;t public. The bank is looking
to expand its portfolio-solutions team of 50 employees, which
invests on behalf of clients and works on asset allocation,
portfolio construction and manager selection, said Andrea
Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company. 
&#8220;When they hire a CIO, not only can they then sell their
product better, but that gives them internal knowledge,&#8221;
Charles Skorina, whose headhunting firm Charles A. Skorina  Co.
in San Francisco advises endowments, said in an interview last
week. &#8220;This guy comes into Goldman and the Goldman guys say,
&#8216;OK, what kind of products does an endowment need and how should
we structure our products so we can go and sell a complete
set?&#8217;&#8221; 
Pacific Investment Management Co. and Perella Weinberg
Partners have added or expanded asset-management services for
endowments as they recover from record losses during the
financial crisis. U.S. institutions will outsource more than
half a trillion dollars in investments by the end of 2012,
according to estimates by consultant Casey Quirk  Associates
LLC. 
Candidate Search 
The portfolio-solutions group is part of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, catering to endowments, foundations, public
and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family
offices and insurance firms, Raphael said. Chris Kojima and
Charles Baillie, partners at the firm, run the group. The asset-
management unit also serves those clients through its fund-of-
funds group, which invests about $80 billion in outside firms. 
The firm approached candidates through headhunter Charles
Sterling Group LLC in Boston, said two of the people, who had
been contacted and turned down the job. The bank has talked with
candidates from pension funds, endowments and other asset
managers, according to another person familiar with the search.
Raphael declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s recruiting efforts. 
U.S. institutions will probably outsource $510 billion in
investments by the end of 2012, more than double the $195
billion as of the most recent data at the end of 2008, according
to Casey Quirk of Darien, Connecticut. Investors most likely to
use outsourcing services are those with $250 million to $750
million in assets, which struggle to find talent and can&#8217;t
access the best investment strategies, the company said. 
Yale&#8217;s Swensen 
It costs about $2 million to $3 million a year to maintain
an investment office with five employees, compared with a fee of
50 basis points on assets under management in a typical
outsourced agreement, Skorina said. 
Endowments outperformed market indexes for years by
following a style pioneered by David Swensen, Yale University&#8217;s
investment chief. The strategy relies on so-called alternative
assets including commodities, real estate and private equity to
outperform market indexes. Some of those hard-to-sell holdings
fell more than public stocks and bonds in the year ending June
2009, leaving endowments with losses. 
&#8220;Investing in alternatives and alternatives being a much
bigger allocation of portfolios has been a big driver in the
interest in outsourcing,&#8221; said Kevin Quirk, a partner at Casey
Quirk. Losses from some alternative investments &#8220;brought into
question whether or not these things are sustainable for the
long term,&#8221; he said. 
Rate Swaps 
Top endowments used outsourcing firms in the 1960s and
1970s, which were &#8220;generally disasters,&#8221; said Josh Lerner, a
Harvard Business School professor who wrote a case study on
Yale&#8217;s endowment. The New Haven, Connecticut school, which
helped to found Endowment Management and Research Corp. in
Boston, fired the manager in 1979 after the institution&#8217;s fund
had dropped 46 percent since 1969 on an inflation-adjusted
basis, according to Lerner&#8217;s research. 
&#8220;The intermediaries tended to take a very short-run view
or else engaged in activities that were beneficial for their own
account trading or client development but were detrimental to
the long-run returns of their university clients,&#8221; Lerner said
in an e-mail. 
Forst 
For more than 20 years, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc. sold swaps as a way for schools, towns and
nonprofit organizations to reduce interest costs and protect
against rising payments on variable-rate debt. In 2008, the
value of Harvard&#8217;s interest-rate swaps tumbled and its endowment
plunged, forcing the school to raise $2.5 billion in bonds that
December as it was squeezed for collateral. 
Edward Forst, who rejoined Goldman Sachs in September after
11 months helping to oversee finances at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, became co-head of the firm&#8217;s
investment-management division at the end of February with Tim
O&#8217;Neill. Before he left for Harvard, Forst had spent less than a
year helping to run Goldman&#8217;s investment-management unit. 
Asset management, which oversees funds for institutions and
wealthy individuals, is a smaller department at Goldman Sachs
than investment banking and trading. The division&#8217;s 2009 revenue
of $3.97 billion accounted for 8.8 percent of the firm&#8217;s sales.
Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from 2008 as incentive and
management fees declined. Assets under management climbed 12
percent from a year earlier to $871 billion as rising markets
more than offset fund withdrawals. 
Pimco Additions 
The division doubled its third-party distribution sales
force last year and &#8220;significantly&#8221; increased its coverage of
institutional and private wealth accounts, according to the
firm&#8217;s annual letter to shareholders April 7. The unit serves
2,000 institutional clients and more than 25,000 private wealth
accounts. 
Pimco, led by Mohamed El-Erian, the former Harvard fund
chief, last month hired Gregory Hazlett as head of equity
strategies and Andrew Hoffmann to oversee real-asset
investments. They report to Mark Taborsky, an executive vice
president at the firm and former Harvard endowment manager.
Taborsky leads a fund-of-funds unit, based on the alternative-
investing model of endowments, targeting school funds and other
clients. 
Campus Recruits 
Other asset managers have recruited chief investment
officers from schools. Perella Weinberg in New York hired
Christopher Bittman, former CIO of the University of Colorado
Foundation, in July to lead a unit that manages money for
endowments. David Russ, a former manager of Dartmouth College&#8217;s
fund, was hired in June at Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG
as a chief investment strategist in asset management. 
A number of higher-education money managers have left
academia to start their own firms. They include Jack Meyer, who
stepped down from his Harvard Management Co. chief executive
officer post in 2005 to form Convexity Capital Management LP in
Boston with $6.3 billion from clients, and ex-Stanford
Management Co. head Michael McCaffery, who raised $7 billion
from investors including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen
to start Makena Capital Management LLC in 2006. 
University funds lost an average of 19 percent in the year
ending June 2009, according to the National Association of
College and University Business Officers, based in Washington,
and Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut. It was the biggest annual
loss in the 35 years for which records have been kept. 
Endowment Turnover 
With tumbling endowments has come turnover in the ranks of
managers who oversee the funds. Dartmouth College in Hanover,
New Hampshire, Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts,
and New York University in Manhattan didn&#8217;t immediately fill CIO
positions as they reviewed spending. Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Connecticut, fired CIO Thomas Kannam in October. 
James Walsh of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York,
announced plans in February to step down at the end of the
academic year. Christopher Brightman resigned last month from
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Stanford
University&#8217;s endowment, the third-richest among U.S. colleges,
is searching for a chief investment officer after leaving the
post vacant for more than two years.

Microsoft Corp. introduced a line
of mobile phones today that are focused on social-networking
features to win over teens and young adults who have flocked to
devices from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. 
Called Kin One and Kin Two, the phones will be made by
Sharp Corp. and sold in the U.S. by Verizon Wireless starting in
May, Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft President Robbie
Bach, who oversees the mobile-phone unit, demonstrated the
phones today at an event in San Francisco. 
The phones represent a new strategy for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, which previously had only developed
software for phone manufacturers, rather than getting deeply
into hardware design itself. The move echoes Google&#8217;s decision
to sell the Nexus One handset in addition to offering phone
makers its Android operating system. 
&#8220;We said, &#8216;Look, there&#8217;s a segment here that we can really
go after deeply,&#8221; Bach said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;And once you decide to go deep, you
can&#8217;t go part way and say we&#8217;ll do the software and then we&#8217;ll
hand it off to somebody else. You have to really be involved in
the whole process.&#8221; 
The Kin phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain
and the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. 
Microsoft may develop phone hardware for other segments of
the market in the future, said Todd Peters, vice president in
the company&#8217;s mobile communications marketing group. 
Partners or Competitors 
The risk in the strategy is that phone makers who view
Microsoft and Google as partners see these moves as competition,
making them less likely to want to use Microsoft&#8217;s or Google&#8217;s
operating systems, ABI Research analyst Kevin Burden said. Bach
said in January that it would be &#8220;very, very difficult&#8221; for
Google to sell its own phone while keeping manufacturers and
carriers for other Android handsets happy. 
Bach said Microsoft&#8217;s approach is different than Google&#8217;s,
because Google sells the Nexus One itself, while Microsoft is
relying on Verizon and Vodafone. 
&#8220;They can get away with it because they&#8217;re not selling it
themselves,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s Burden said of Microsoft. &#8220;It looks really
different because they didn&#8217;t set up their own Web site store
for it like Google.&#8221; 
Microsoft fell 2 cents to $30.32 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares are little changed this year. 
Social-Networking Sites 
The Kin phones include cameras, touch screens and slide-out
keyboards for text messaging. The phone takes updates from
social-networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace
and displays them in one place on the phone&#8217;s main screen,
called the Kin Loop. Users can drag videos, photos, status
updates, text messages and Web sites to one spot on the phone
and then share the whole package of content with friends. 
Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to disclose
pricing for the phones. 
Facing market share declines, Microsoft also is releasing a
new version of its phone operating system for handset
manufacturers to use later this year. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows dropped to a 7.9 percent share of the
worldwide smartphone-software market in the fourth quarter from
12.5 percent a year earlier, while the iPhone and Android posted
gains, according to ABI Research. 
The iPhone took 16.6 percent of the market in the fourth
quarter, up from 10.8 percent the previous year, Oyster Bay, New
York-based ABI said. Android climbed to 8.5 percent from 1.7
percent. 
Targeting Young Consumers 
Verizon Wireless, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and
U.K.-based Vodafone are targeting young people who will buy
plans for texting and Web access, seeking to expand their
fastest-growing revenue stream. Sales of data plans at Verizon
Wireless rose 46 percent in the fourth quarter, contributing
almost a third of the company&#8217;s wireless-service revenue. 
Microsoft and Verizon Wireless kept the Kin&#8217;s target
demographic group in mind at today&#8217;s event, held at a San
Francisco club called Mighty. A rusty truck stood outside
selling sugar waffles. Inside, baristas hired from a local cafe
served up Ethiopian and Brazilian coffee while photos of denim-
and flannel-clad young people flashed on screens around the
room. 
&#8220;This is an age group Microsoft has to court,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s
Burden said. &#8220;They&#8217;re kind of losing this group to Apple and
Google, and what they don&#8217;t want is to have all these late teens
and early 20-somethings not growing up Microsoft.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, who took over from John Mack in January,
said he&#8217;s not content with results for last year, when the
company reported its first per-share annual loss. 
&#8220;We are not satisfied with our performance,&#8221; Gorman said
today in a letter to shareholders. &#8220;Our goal, as we move
forward, is to rank in the top three in the key businesses in
which we operate.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
trailed rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in trading
revenue last year. Gorman&#8217;s New York-based firm has hired more
than 350 employees as part of a &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of its sales
and trading business, he said in the letter. 
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the firm to post
adjusted earnings of $2.85 a share in 2010, according to the
average of 27 estimates. That would be the largest profit since
2006. 
Gorman, 51, said &#8220;headwinds&#8221; related to the firm&#8217;s
tightening debt spreads are &#8220;largely behind us.&#8221; Those charges
reduced the firm&#8217;s revenue last year by $5.5 billion and lowered
earnings per share by $2.84, according to the letter. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith
Barney wealth-management unit &#8220;is going to play an increasingly
important role in our growth and profitability,&#8221; Gorman said.
Morgan Stanley purchased a controlling stake in the venture last
year, giving it about 18,000 financial advisers and $1.56
trillion in client assets as of Dec. 31. 
TARP Program 
There is &#8220;no question&#8221; that Morgan Stanley and the
financial industry benefited from the Treasury Department&#8217;s
Troubled Asset Relief Program and other government efforts to
stabilize markets, Gorman said. 
He also called on the industry to &#8220;work as partners with
regulators and legislators&#8221; in shaping regulatory reform, and
declared his support for a systemic-risk regulator with the
ability to prevent &#8220;excessive&#8221; risk taking. 
&#8220;In the wake of the financial crisis, we believe that
fundamental regulatory reform is critical for our industry--and
the global capital markets,&#8221; Gorman wrote. &#8220;We are committed
to working cooperatively with policy makers and to playing a
constructive role in building a new regulatory framework.&#8221;

The German auction for mobile-
phone frequencies, which started today, is the largest in a
slew of such sales in Europe and may determine how much
operators are willing to pay for new spectrum. 
The new frequencies will alleviate pressure on networks as
companies including Apple Inc. unveil data-hungry devices such
as the iPad tablet computer and users increasingly download
videos and music on mobile phones. Deutsche Telekom AG,
Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and Royal KPN NV are
participating in the auction. 
The phone companies will spend as much as 6 billion euros
($8.1 billion) combined, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service estimates,
while Commerzbank AG predicts a total investment of 7.5 billion
euros. At the last German auction in 2000, the sale of third-
generation licenses fetched 99.4 billion deutsche marks, or
about 50 billion euros. 
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to be anywhere near
those crazy amounts that we saw in 2000,&#8221; CreditSights analyst
Mark Chapman said in a phone interview today. &#8220;With 10 more
years of maturity, the industry is much more realistic.&#8221; 
In the first round, the four companies&#8217; highest bids
totaled 94.5 million euros, with Telefonica&#8217;s O2 emerging as
the highest bidder, exceeding minimum bids allowed by three
times in two instances, and by 80 percent in six instances. 
Where Deutsche Telekom was the highest bidder it exceeded
the minimum bid allowed by 0.8 percent or by nothing, Vodafone
exceeded minimum allowed bids by 0.4 percent or by nothing, and
KPN&#8217;s E-Plus submitted bids that were at most 0.8 percent
higher than the minimum. In the second round, the highest bids
totaled 114.9 million euros. 
Auction Schedules 
The Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and France are
expected to hold auctions this year, according to Chapman. The
U.K. is expected to auction frequencies next year, while Spain,
Italy and Portugal have yet to say when their auctions will
take place. 
Deutsche Telekom, Europe&#8217;s largest telephone company,
Vodafone, Telefonica&#8217;s O2 and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus are the four network
operators in Germany. They have a combined 108.5 million
subscribers as some of the 82 million people living in the
country have more than one mobile-phone subscription. 
Pressure on Networks 
&#8220;There&#8217;s already a situation in the U.S. where it&#8217;s
getting more difficult for smartphones to access the Internet,
especially in San Francisco and Manhattan,&#8221; said Matthias
Kurth, president of the German federal network agency, in
Mainz, Germany, at an April 8 briefing on the auction. &#8220;We
want to avert such a development here.&#8221; 
In December, the wireless division of ATT Inc., the
biggest U.S. phone company, said 1 percent of smartphone
customers accounted for 20 percent of the data drain on its
network, while its top 3 percent were using 40 percent. 
In the U.S., Federal Communications Chairman Julius
Genachowski said in February that the country faces a &#8220;looming
spectrum crunch&#8221; and said he wants to auction airwaves held by
television stations to make room for more mobile Internet use. 
The most coveted frequencies in Germany are in the 800
megahertz band, previously used to broadcast TV and dubbed the
&#8220;digital dividend.&#8221; These have better indoor coverage and
geographical reach than higher frequencies, making it cheaper
to build networks that facilitate broadband coverage in rural
areas. 
Partnership Possibilities 
Under the auction terms, only three of the four German
operators will be able to secure enough spectrum in the 800 MHz
band. Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, which have a combined
market share of 70 percent, may gain the biggest slice of the
frequency. 
In the first round of bids, O2 submitted two bids of 7.5
million euros for two of the paired frequencies in the 800 MHz
band, or three times the minimum 2.5 million euros allowed. In
the second round, E-Plus overtook Telefonica as the highest
bidder for the two pairs of frequencies, at 8.6 million euros. 
Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s highest bid for another two 800 MHz
frequency pairs was 2.52 million euros each, or 20,000 euros
above the minimum allowed, and Vodafone bid 2.51 million euros
for the last pair. Both companies&#8217; bids remained unchallenged
in the second round. 
Following the auction, Telefonica&#8217;s O2 and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus
may seek a partnership either with each other, or O2 with
Vodafone, if they don&#8217;t get the spectrum they need on their
own, analysts have said. 
Bernstein Research analyst Robin Bienenstock said in a
note on March 17 that E-Plus may need to strike a network-
sharing deal in Germany after the auction to limit operating
expenses. 
Network Terms 
KPN Chief Executive Officer Ad Scheepbouwer has said he
remains open to any form of partnership. Auction rules prohibit
cooperation during the auction, meaning all bidders are on
their own until the bidding is over. 
The 800 MHz frequencies come with specific terms attached.
The winners commit to building a network to cover at least 90
percent of the population in rural towns and districts,
starting with areas with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, before
they can use these frequencies in more densely populated areas. 
The costs associated with these terms may prompt companies
to spend on other frequencies, Kurth said. In total, 41
frequency blocks are for sale. 
The operators are free to choose which technology they
wish to employ. Last time around, frequencies were allocated to
GSM or UMTS technologies. 
&#8216;Game of Chicken&#8217; 
All the operators in Germany have had to name which
frequencies they intend to bid on, and, according to Kurth, the
demand is for &#8220;significantly more&#8221; than is available. 
The auction started today at 1 pm. From tomorrow, it will
take place from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day, with a minimum of
four rounds of bidding per day at 90 minutes per round. The
result of each round, with the name of the highest bidder for
each frequency block, will be published on the network agency&#8217;s
Web site. The auction ends when no higher bids are submitted
for any of the frequencies. 
&#8220;The companies have many rounds to go through, they don&#8217;t
really need to decide right now,&#8221; CreditSights&#8217; Chapman said.
&#8220;They will probably see how the bids unfold. It&#8217;s definitely a
game of chicken.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Japan
Chairman Akio Asuke, a former veteran banker at Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., will step down on June 30. 
Asuke, 67, will become an adviser starting July 1, the U.S.
bank said in a statement distributed at the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today. He joined Goldman Sachs after resigning as deputy
president at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in June 2002, it said. 
Asuke&#8217;s departure comes three months after Sumitomo Mitsui
asked Goldman Sachs to convert its preferred shares to an equity
stake. The New York-based firm in 2003 bought 150.3 billion yen
($1.6 billion) of the Sumitomo Mitsui securities to help bolster
capital eroded by losses on holdings and bad loans. 
Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t decided who will succeed Asuke or if
the bank will retain the position, said Hiroko Matsumoto, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs.

Nashville, home of country-music
stars such as Taylor Swift and the Grand Ole Opry, will boost
city-backed debt by almost 40 percent to borrow $633 million for
a new convention center three times the size of the Tennessee
municipality&#8217;s current one. 
Bonds to be sold tomorrow by Nashville and Davidson
County&#8217;s Convention Center Authority through investment banks
led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pledge general-fund revenue if
hotel, airport and rental-car taxes and use of the Music City
Center aren&#8217;t enough to repay investors. The tourism revenue
won&#8217;t be adequate, said Councilwoman Emily Evans, a former
municipal bond underwriter. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a riverboat gamble with very little upside,&#8221; said
Evans, who worked for 15 years at J.C. Bradford  Co., the
Nashville firm acquired by Paine Webber in 2000. &#8220;It just
doesn&#8217;t seem like a good bet to me.&#8221; 
Nashville, the home of the Country Music Hall of Fame,
hopes to enhance tourism by creating retail and parking areas,
tripling exhibit space to 350,000 square feet and adding 64,000
square feet of ballrooms, according to the preliminary official
statement. 
The $415 million Music City Center will enable the city to
compete for larger meetings, add 1,524 jobs and generate almost
$135 million of new annual spending by 2017, according to a
study by HVS Convention, Sports  Entertainment in Chicago on
Jan. 6. The facility is forecast to yield almost $12 million in
new tax revenue beyond tourism levies dedicated to the $40
million-a-year of debt service, said consulting firm HVS. 
Attendance Down 
With convention center attendance down nationwide -- a 30
percent decline in Las Vegas and 28 percent in Orlando, Florida,
two of the largest convention markets in the U.S. -- Nashville&#8217;s
taxpayers may wind up paying part of the cost if use of the new
center falls short, said Heywood Sanders, professor of public
administration at the University of Texas in San Antonio, who
has studied convention centers. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a leap of faith,&#8221; said Sanders, who&#8217;s writing
a book on convention center financing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty large
chunk of debt.&#8221; 
The city is selling in four parts, with about $605 million
as taxable Build America Bonds, which come with a 35 percent
subsidy from the U.S. government under economic stimulus
legislation passed last year by Congress. 
The average yield on Build America securities fell 6 basis
points to a three-week low of 6.17 percent yesterday, according
to the Wells Fargo Build America Bond Index. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. 
Tourism Boost 
A larger convention center is forecast to increase hotel
room-tax receipts for the city to $30.5 million in 2014 from
just over $28 million in 2009, according to a feasibility study
released by HVS on March 26. By 2019, it&#8217;s estimated to exceed
$40 million a year. At the same time the new borrowings will
increase debt backed by the city&#8217;s general fund by 39.6 percent
to $2.23 billion. 
&#8220;We have an opportunity to take visitor taxes and fees,
and invest them in a way that creates jobs and grows our local
economy,&#8221; Mayor Karl Dean said in a Jan. 6 statement. 
A new facility was needed to attract conventions, said
Marty Dickens, chairman of the convention center authority, in a
phone interview. The city is using the same financial model it
employed for the existing site in 1987, which is now too small
to compete in luring events, he said. 
&#8216;Untested&#8217; Projections 
Fitch Ratings, which ranks the bonds being sold at A+, in
evaluating the convention center debt, lowered the city&#8217;s
general obligation grade by one rung on April 6 to AA-, its
fourth-highest level, citing the &#8220;potential additional fiscal
strains of the debt-financed convention center upon an already
pressured general fund,&#8221; the company said. Projections on two
tourism taxes &#8220;are untested&#8221; and &#8220;heavily dependent upon
increased tourism&#8221; at the convention center, Fitch said. 
&#8220;We realized the city feels it will be vital to increasing
the desirability of downtown,&#8221; said Amy Laskey, an analyst at
Fitch, in a phone interview. &#8220;The city already operated on a
thinly balanced budget, so the debt does increase the risk for
the general fund.&#8221; 
The new bond issue is structured with reserves and revenue
projections that exceed what is needed to cover payments to
investors to protect the city&#8217;s general fund, said Dickens. 
&#8220;The convention market would have to seriously go to
pieces before we would need general fund dollars,&#8221; Dickens
said. &#8220;A lot of conventions like to come here because of our
reputation as a music city.&#8221; 
Moody&#8217;s Rating 
The biggest portion of the obligations is rated Aa3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the
fourth- and sixth-highest rankings, respectively. Ten-year, AAA
rated municipal bonds traded at yields of 3.28 percent, down 2
basis points from a nine-month high today. 
Richard Riebeling, the city&#8217;s director of finance, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. Wayne Placide, the city&#8217;s
financial adviser with First Southwest Co. in Dallas, referred a
request for comment to Jeff Scruggs, a managing director with
Goldman Sachs. The firm&#8217;s spokesman, Michael DuVally, said
Scruggs couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show further losses in its
prime and subprime mortgage portfolios when it reports first-
quarter earnings, according to analyst Dick Bove. 
&#8220;Losses have not been curtailed,&#8221; Bove, vice president of
Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, said in a Bloomberg
Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;In the commercial
industrial loan portfolio and in the consumer portfolio, we
should start to see some improvement.&#8221; 
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon faces
challenges with low money-lending rates and increasing
regulation, said Bove, who has &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-
based bank. 
&#8220;His margins are going to be stressed because he needs
higher interest rates,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;His loan volume is likely
to be lower, and they&#8217;re going to be issues with his noninterest
income because of this new Regulation E and the credit-card bill
-- both of which control what he can charge for different
products that he signs.&#8221; 
Analysts expect JPMorgan&#8217;s net income declined from the end
of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending, with
mortgage writedowns as high as $2.5 billion per quarter during
2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009, according to
company data. Bove forecast earnings of 62 cents a share,
compared with the 64-cent average of his and 20 other analysts&#8217;
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. 
The shares of JPMorgan fell 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$46.02 at 3:31 p.m. in New York. 
Bove, who has been an analyst since 1965, recommended
selling Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. stock four months before
it collapsed, helping investors avoid a 65 percent plunge in the
shares before he raised them to &#8220;buy&#8221; on Aug. 21, 2008. Lehman
filed the world&#8217;s largest bankruptcy three weeks later.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s board added
Cynthia Telles, who is head of a California hospital clinic and
served with GM Chairman Ed Whitacre as a director of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. 
Telles, 57, is on the medical school faculty at the
University of California at Los Angeles and is director of
UCLA&#8217;s Neuropsychiatric Institute Spanish-Speaking Psychosocial
Clinic, GM said today in a statement. The addition gives the
Detroit-based automaker 13 board members. 
&#8220;She&#8217;s got a good reputation,&#8221; said Harley Shaiken, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley who
specializes in labor issues. &#8220;She does bring a diverse
perspective to the board. It appears to be a positive step.&#8221; 
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, reorganized in a
government-aided bankruptcy last year. Whitacre, 68, has led
the company&#8217;s board since GM&#8217;s July 10 exit from court
protection and took over as chief executive officer in December. 
The automaker expects to report &#8220;solid&#8221; first-quarter
operating results, Whitacre said yesterday in an e-mail to
employees. In a March 31 message to employees, he said he had
completed his overhaul of GM&#8217;s senior management. 
Telles in September joined Whitacre on the board of
Burlington Northern, the second-largest U.S. railroad by sales.
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy the
railroad in November and completed the purchase in February. 
Adding Telles as a director &#8220;ensures that the company will
continue to benefit from a diversity of perspectives and
experience,&#8221; GM said in its statement. She also is on the
boards of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals and
Americas United Bank, the automaker said. 
President Barack Obama appointed Telles as a member of the
Commission on Presidential Scholars last week. She was a city
commissioner in Los Angeles for 13 years. 
Telles holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Smith College in
Northampton, Massachusetts, and a doctorate in clinical
psychology from Boston University, GM said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
second-largest corporation, reduced Chief Executive Officer Rex
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation by 16 percent last year after the
company lost more than one-seventh of its market valuation. 
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation fell to $27.2 million in 2009 from
$32.2 million a year earlier, based on U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission rules. The information was disclosed today
by the Irving, Texas-based company in a regulatory filing. 
Tillerson, 58, was paid a salary of $2.06 million, a $2.4
million bonus and stock awards worth almost $17 million, the
filing showed. He also accrued $5.47 million from changes in the
value of his pension and deferred compensation, and $280,925 in
the form of personal security, life insurance and the use of
company-owned aircraft. 
Exxon shares fell 15 percent in 2009, the second
consecutive annual decline, as the recession squashed demand and
prices for petroleum-based fuels. Net income tumbled 57 percent
last year, the largest annual drop since Exxon Corp.&#8217;s 1999
acquisition of Mobil Corp. 
In his fifth year as CEO, Tillerson is spending almost $77
million a day to find untapped oil fields and build platforms to
exploit previous discoveries. In December, he signed a $29.2
billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc. to capture the Fort Worth,
Texas-based company&#8217;s gas-drilling expertise and extensive North
American prospects. 
Effective Jan. 1, Tillerson&#8217;s annual salary rose 7.3
percent to $2.21 million, the filing said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, sold its 9.43 percent stake in Norwegian natural-
gas pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas Infrastructure AS. 
Exxon Mobil will retain its current capacity rights to
transport gas through the pipeline and will remain a major user
of the system, the company said in a statement on its Web site
today. Continued access to capacity is assured through the
third-party open access regime created when Gassled was
established, the company said. The sale is subject to the
approval of the Norwegian authorities. 
&#8220;This divestment will have no impact on Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
operated or partner-operated producing assets in Norway,&#8221; the
company said in the statement. Kristin Kragseth, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
spokeswoman in Norway, declined to comment on the price the
company got for the stake. 
Gassled, a joint venture created in 2003 between oil and
gas companies operating on the Norwegian continental shelf, owns
the country&#8217;s gas transport infrastructure. Exxon was among the
partners that complained to Norway&#8217;s government in 2008 when
state-controlled Statoil ASA and Petoro AS took control of the
network, holding 32.1 percent and 38.46 percent respectively. 
The company began marketing its stake last summer, Eirik
Hauge, a spokesman for Exxon, said in August. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA, Dong Energy A/S
and ConocoPhillips are also stakeholders in Gassled.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show net income declined from
the end of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending
when it reports first-quarter earnings tomorrow. 
Profit was probably about $2.93 billion, or 64 cents a
share, according to the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. That compares with net income of $3.28 billion, or
74 cents, in the fourth quarter and $2.14 billion, or 40 cents,
a year earlier during the depths of the financial crisis. 
Mortgage writedowns may be as high as $2.5 billion per
quarter during 2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009,
according to company data. Analysts including Anthony Polini at
Raymond James  Associates said they will be watching to see if
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was able to reduce
provisions against future credit losses as a gauge of whether
the worst of the U.S. housing crisis is over. 
&#8220;The key factor for this quarter for banks will be to say
reserve builds are largely behind us and the outlook for lower
problem loans and loan losses have improved for the second half
of the year,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the outlook that matters.&#8221; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest competitors will probably post profits
for the quarter, according to the Bloomberg survey, even as U.S.
lenders are collapsing at the fastest pace in 17 years.
Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America Corp., may report earnings of $455 million when
it releases results on April 19, the survey shows. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America may report a profit of
$1.42 billion on April 16. 
Credit Quality 
&#8220;For the banks, the thing that matters more than anything
else is the trend in credit quality and the rate of inflow of
new problem loans. That trumps all,&#8221; said Chris Kotowski, an
equity analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t
mean that there aren&#8217;t any new problems coming in, but the rate
of inflows are diminished.&#8221; 
Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$1.77 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis and the
worst job market in 26 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The pace of losses has begun to slow in the past two
quarters and the housing market has shown signs of stabilization
even as the federal government withdraws support from financial
markets. 
Problem Loans 
Charge-offs from consumer credit-card and mortgage loans at
JPMorgan are expected to be about $8.6 billion in the first
quarter, a 10 percent increase from the previous three months,
according to Credit Suisse analysts led by Moshe Orenbuch.
&#8220;Reserving remains the largest variable to reported earnings,&#8221;
they wrote in an April 8 research note to clients. 
Dimon has succeeded in generating profit throughout the
global credit contraction, suggesting he may be able to restore
the dividend to pre-crisis levels before major competitors. 
The bank, which cut its quarterly payout to shareholders to
5 cents from 38 cents in February 2009, may boost the dividend
if the U.S. economy shows several months of improvement in the
jobless rate and there is a &#8220;significant reduction&#8221; in charge-
offs, Dimon said last month in his annual letter to
shareholders. 
The 54-year-old CEO claimed credit in the letter for
helping to stabilize markets during the crisis by purchasing
Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual as they headed toward
collapse. 
Credit Cards 
JPMorgan is offsetting declines in mortgage banking and
credit cards with trading revenue, which analysts from Credit
Suisse estimated will show an increase to $4.9 billion from $3
billion in the fourth quarter. Credit Suisse said a credit-
market recovery was fueling fixed-income results at JPMorgan. 
&#8220;The credit markets really, really did well in the first
quarter,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets
in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s mainly because the Fed is
printing money and there&#8217;s a lot of money sitting on the
sidelines coming into the market right now, especially in the
fixed-income side.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said a
&#8220;broad-based&#8221; economic recovery boosted first-quarter earnings
55 percent, surprising analysts with record fixed-income trading
revenue and a better-than-expected outlook for consumer credit. 
Net income at the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets
climbed to $3.33 billion, or 74 cents a share, from $2.14
billion, or 40 cents, in the same period a year earlier and from
$3.28 billion in the fourth quarter, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. Record fixed-income trading revenue
and a reduction in provisions for credit losses helped the bank
beat the average estimate of 64 cents per share projected by 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;There is clear and broad-based improvement in the
economic factors in the United States and around the world,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, told reporters on a
conference call. 
Dimon cited signs including stabilizing U.S. home prices
that signal the economy may be poised for a &#8220;strong recovery.&#8221;
Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said delinquencies for
credit cards and mortgages in which the borrower is behind by
just one payment also improved in the first quarter, indicating
that consumers&#8217; finances are gaining strength after the worst
recession in more than 70 years. 
JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in federal aid last
year, remained profitable throughout the financial crisis,
relying on fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending
and credit cards. The bank, the No. 1 underwriter of stocks and
bonds in the U.S. last year, generated three-quarters of first-
quarter profit from its investment bank. 
Unexpected Strength 
&#8220;Nobody saw those types of numbers coming,&#8221; said Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings bode well for Bank of America Corp. and
other banks, which report earnings later this month, Miller
said. &#8220;Credit remains a wild card here, but Jamie talked very,
very positive about credit and the consumer,&#8221; he said. 
JPMorgan rose $1.86, or 4.1 percent, to $47.73 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m., the biggest
gain in six months and the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008. The
shares are up 15 percent this year. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s growing, India&#8217;s growing, Japan is growing, home
prices have stopped going down, consumer income is up, consumers
are spending, service and manufacturing indexes are up,
inventories are still low, I could go on and on,&#8221; Dimon said.
&#8220;This could be the makings of a good recovery. We don&#8217;t know
for sure, but if you look at those factors, it&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221; 
&#8216;Real Improvement&#8217; 
Cavanagh said on the call that there is &#8220;fundamental real
improvement&#8221; in consumer mortgage and credit-card
delinquencies. That didn&#8217;t translate into lower credit costs for
the quarter, though he said it &#8220;augurs well for future quarters
if those trends sustain themselves.&#8221; 
Home lending and credit-card losses continued to pull down
earnings. Retail banking lost $131 million, compared with a $399
million net loss during the fourth quarter and a $474 million
gain a year earlier. 
The company decreased provisions against future credit
losses while setting aside $2.3 billion in reserves for lawsuits
stemming from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc. Credit-card
services lost $303 million, compared with a net loss of $306
million in the prior three months and $547 million a year
earlier. 
First-quarter revenue climbed 11 percent to $27.7 billion,
beating the highest estimate among analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. Fixed-income revenue was $5.46 billion, compared with
$4.89 billion a year earlier. 
Fixed Income 
The firm said improving fixed-income markets contributed to
the revenue gains, as did a $462 million reversal of provisions
for credit costs in investment banking, which compared with $1.2
billion in expenses a year earlier. JPMorgan cited lower loan
balances, driven by repayments and loan sales. 
The bank reduced total provisions for credit losses in all
divisions to $7 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in the
previous quarter and $10 billion the year before. 
The investment bank contributed $2.47 billion of JPMorgan&#8217;s
$3.33 billion in net income, or 74 percent. That compares with
57 percent in the fourth quarter and 75 percent in the first
quarter of 2009. 
&#8220;The good news is that the revenue picture was actually
quite strong,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC, in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio.
&#8220;And in particular, within investment banking, fixed-income
trading. That had been an area of concern, so March must have
been a blockbuster month.&#8221; 
Citigroup Earnings 
JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest lender behind
JPMorgan and Bank of America, may report earnings of $340
million when it releases results on April 19, the Bloomberg
survey shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $1.1 billion on April 16. 
Dimon and Cavanagh didn&#8217;t give shareholders immediate hope
of restoring the quarterly dividend, which was cut to 5 cents
from 38 cents in February 2009. 
&#8220;We want to see continued sustained improvement in
employment, continued sustained improvement in delinquencies&#8221;
and a better understanding of new bank capital rules before the
dividend will increase, Dimon said, reiterating what he told
shareholders in his annual letter last month. 
Cavanagh said that increasing the payout to shareholders is
&#8220;going to be down the road a little more.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley, once the biggest
property investor among Wall Street banks, expects to lose $5.4
billion, or 61 percent, of its $8.8 billion global fund, said a
person familiar with the situation. 
The firm sent a fourth-quarter update to clients in recent
weeks showing the 2007 fund was likely to recover $3.4 billion
of its investments, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. A spokesman for
New York-based Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Morgan Stanley raised the fund, Morgan Stanley Real Estate
Fund VI International, toward the end of the property surge when
market prices were at or near the peak. At the time, it was the
largest private fund targeting high-return real estate
investments. 
&#8220;Funds of this vintage year are horribly stressed and much
of the equity they&#8217;ve invested has evaporated,&#8221; said Nori
Gerardo Lietz, head of real estate private equity at Partners
Group, who warned in July 2008 that pension funds likely would
face big writedowns on real estate in the next two years.
While the real estate losses at Morgan Stanley and other Wall
Street banks have been increasingly evident since late 2008,
&#8220;people are coming to grips with it,&#8221; said Gerardo Lietz in a
telephone interview today. 
The expected loss was reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal. 
Morgan Stanley invested its 2007 fund around the world,
including Asia and Europe. In the U.S., the firm defaulted last
year on a $2 billion loan to buy Crescent Real Estate Equities
Co. in 2007 and handed over 17 million square feet of office
buildings to lender Barclays Capital. Morgan Stanley agreed in
2009 to relinquish five San Francisco office buildings to its
lender, two years after buying them from Blackstone Group LP. 
Once the second-largest U.S. securities firm, Morgan
Stanley converted to a bank holding company in September 2008
and accepted $10 billion of government bailout funds to survive
the credit crisis.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week. 
O&#8217;Neill said in an interview that trading in local
currencies among Brazil, Russia, India and China -- to be
discussed at a heads-of-state summit of so-called BRIC nations
this week in Brasilia -- won&#8217;t work because of China&#8217;s use of a
dollar peg to manage the value of the yuan. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all semantics to talk about trade in local currency
unless they do what the rest of world wants them to, which is
provide more freedom to use these currencies,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, 53,
said from London. &#8220;The consequences of Chinese policies are
increasingly seen by everyone, including the BRICs.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is building as BRIC
leaders get ready to meet this week to discuss boosting trade in
local currency and coordinating positions on reforming the
international financial system after the global credit crisis.
Chinese President Hu Jintao, who arrives in Brasilia tonight
from the U.S., told President Barack Obama yesterday that China
won&#8217;t bow to pressure after the U.S. leader urged the Asian
country to adopt a &#8220;more market-oriented exchange rate.&#8221; 
Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards rose 0.2 percent
to 6.6225 per dollar as of 12:27 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent from the spot rate of
6.8258. 
Stronger Yuan 
O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to describe the
four large, fast-growing economies, said he was pushing up his
forecast for a stronger yuan from the end of the year because it
is increasingly obvious the currency is undervalued. 
&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s exchange rate policy is &#8220;a particularly big
challenge for Brazilian&#8221; manufacturers as the country seeks to
reduce its reliance on commodity exports, O&#8217;Neill said. China
surpassed the U.S. as Brazil&#8217;s biggest trading partner last
year, as exports of iron-ore and soy rose during the global
recession while manufacturing sales to the U.S. declined. 
Still, even as the countries disagree over how to manage
their currencies, he expects no tension or public criticism of
the yuan&#8217;s peg when Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva hosts his Russian, Indian and Chinese counterparts. 
Instead, the second meeting for leaders from the four
nations will seek to find common ground about ways to reform the
International Monetary Fund, United Nations and other
international institutions. 
&#8220;Being Mr. BRIC, of course I&#8217;m flattered these guys now
meet together, but beyond all being large economies what else
can they really do collectively,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This summit
is a very powerful symbol of how hopeless international
organizations have become.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
property funds may receive investments of as much as $100
million each from the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System
as the pension plan seeks to boost real estate holdings. 
The Tennessee system, with $29 billion in assets, is
considering putting money in the open-ended JPMorgan Strategic
Property Fund and the UBS Trumbull Property Fund, according to a
report prepared for pension board trustees. Townsend Group, the
system&#8217;s real estate consultant, recommends the funds to
clients, according to the report. 
The Tennessee retirement system plans to invest $1 billion
in real estate over the next five years. U.S. property purchases
have plunged since 2007 as values fell and financing dried up.
This year, commercial real estate sales likely will be double
the $52 billion recorded in 2009, while still below their $500
billion peak, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based research company. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still slow, but it certainly looks better than it
did six to 12 months ago,&#8221; said Robert Bach, chief economist
for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-based commercial
broker. &#8220;There seems to be a lot of capital out there.&#8221; 
January&#8217;s commercial real estate values in the U.S. were 40
percent below the peak in October 2007, according to the
Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index. 
Estimated Returns 
JPMorgan&#8217;s fund is estimated to return a dividend of 4.25
percent after fees and the UBS fund is expected to yield 4
percent. The gross asset value of the JPMorgan fund was $14.8
billion and the UBS fund $9.7 billion, according to the
Tennessee report. 
Kris Kagel, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS, and Jackie
Meere of JPMorgan in New York both declined to comment. 
The State Universities Retirement System of Illinois
approved investing $100 million in the UBS fund in December,
according to meeting minutes. The UBS fund had most of its money
in office buildings, apartments and retail centers as of the end
of September, according to an annual review of UBS Realty
Investors by a staff member of the Illinois retirement system.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s head of
investment banking in India, Vedika Bhandarkar, told colleagues
she plans to quit and join Credit Suisse Group, people close to
each firm said. 
Bhandarkar, who&#8217;s been at JPMorgan in India since 1998, is
in talks with Credit Suisse about overseeing its Indian
investment banking unit, according to one of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Sandeep Pangal, a managing director in JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate
finance group in Mumbai, may accompany Bhandarkar to the Swiss
bank, the people said. 
Bhandarkar and Pangal declined to comment, as did JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kavita Sonawala and Credit Suisse spokesman Adam
Harper. The two bankers have worked together for clients
including NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest mobile-phone company,
which they advised on its 2008 purchase of a $2.7 billion stake
in Tata Teleservices Ltd. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost
the vice chairman of its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last
month. She left to become country head for Bank of America Corp. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, ranks third among advisers on
mergers and acquisitions in India during the past 12 months,
based on the total dollar value of announced transactions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
is first and Morgan Stanley second. Zurich-based Credit Suisse
ranks fourth. 
So far this year, JPMorgan is No. eight in advising on
stock sales in the country, behind Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg data
show. Credit Suisse ranks 24th. 
Credit Suisse in November said it named Rahul Chawla as
head of global markets solutions for India. In that position,
Chawla will help originate equity and debt capital markets
transactions among other things, Credit Suisse said at the time.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. claims Grupo
Televisa SA&#8217;s cable unit breached a credit agreement by
objecting to the transfer of a loan from the bank to one
controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim. 
A federal judge in New York in February halted the transfer
after Empresas Cablevision SA complained that assigning the loan
to Slim&#8217;s Banco Inbursa SA might reveal Cablevision&#8217;s
confidential information to a rival cable company owned by Slim. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is asking U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff to order Cablevision to consent to
assigning 90 percent of the $225 million loan to Banco Inbursa. 
&#8220;Cablevision&#8217;s refusal to consent to JPMorgan&#8217;s proposed
assignment to Banco Inbursa was unreasonable and therefore a
breach of the credit assignment,&#8221; JPMorgan said in its filing
yesterday. 
The Televisa unit got the loan in December of 2007 to buy
Bestel SA, which operated a fiber-optic network in Mexico.
JPMorgan originally intended to syndicate the loan but didn&#8217;t do
so in 2008 because of the deteriorating credit market, according
to the ruling. Last year, the bank started efforts to sell the
loan to Inbursa. 
Banco Inbursa is part of Grupo Financiero Inbursa SA,
controlled by Slim, as is Telefonos de Mexico SAB, or Telmex,
Mexico&#8217;s biggest land-line phone company. Telmex seeks to expand
into other telecommunications markets and is a primary
competitor of Cablevision, Rakoff said in the February ruling. 
Irreparable Harm 
Cablevision had shown it was likely to prevail on its claim
and a probability of irreparable harm, the judge said in
February. The participation agreement, under which the loan was
to be transferred, would enable Inbursa to use JPMorgan as a
vehicle for demanding Cablevision&#8217;s confidential information
&#8220;on a virtual unlimited basis,&#8221; according to Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. 
Televisa didn&#8217;t immediately comment, and a spokesman for
Slim didn&#8217;t return messages seeking comment. 
The case is Empresas Cablevision v. JPMorgan, 09-9972, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Xenon Capital Partners, an

Stan Song and Hamid Gayibov quit JPMorgan last week and may

Credit Suisse hired five fixed-income specialists last month,

Xenon said it needs more bankers to handle a &#8220;range of MA
mandates for state-owned corporates in the energy sector,&#8221;
describing Song as one of Russia&#8217;s &#8220;most reputable MA
bankers&#8221; and Gayibov as a &#8220;rainmaker&#8221; executive. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s former head of investment banking in Russia,
Natalia Tsukanova, set up Xenon last year to advise Igor Sechin,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#8217;s deputy for energy and chairman
of OAO Rosneft, the country&#8217;s largest oil company. Ex-JPMorgan
MA banker Kamil Burganov joined Xenon in February and another
colleague Anton Voronin came over in March, Burganov said. 
Twenty Hires 
Xenon is expanding as the government consolidates state
assets in industries including energy, aerospace and
shipbuilding to help reduce Russia&#8217;s dependence on oil and gas
exports, and prepares some for sale. Russia is combining six
state-owned regional airlines under OAO Aeroflot. State shipping
company Sovcomflot plans to sell shares in an initial public
offering in late 2010 or early 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Sergei Frank, a former transport minister, told reporters in
Moscow today. 
Xenon plans to hire a total of 20 staff to focus on
consolidation in the domestic energy industry and later help
state-owned companies with foreign acquisitions, Burganov said.
The company has a London office which will eventually advise
companies seeking to list on the London Stock Exchange, he said. 
As well as consulting on acquisitions, Xenon manages a $2
billion state-owned power utilities fund, Burganov said. The
fund, called Rusenergo, holds stakes in companies including OAO
Rushydro, Russia&#8217;s largest hydropower producer, and electricity
producers known as TGKs and OGKs, Burganov said. 
&#8220;The fund is focused exclusively on the power sector,&#8221;
Burganov said by phone. &#8220;But our MA advisory work for state-
owned companies will cover oil, gas, oil-services, utilities and
manufacturing sectors.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said the Chinese government may let
its currency become free floating within five years. 
&#8220;China has made noises about the renminbi being part of
the SDR from 2015,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today, referring to the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s
Special Drawing Rights. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really be part of the SDR
unless you have completely free-floating exchange rates and free
capital markets. That would imply that those who make those
noises, primarily&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China, are &#8220;pushing
for the next five years.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s current 21-month peg to
the dollar is building as Chinese President Hu Jintao this week
meets with the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India in Brasilia
to discuss boosting trade in local currency and reforming the
international financial system. President Barack Obama said this
week that the U.S. considers the yuan to be &#8220;undervalued.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s economic growth quickened to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, data released today
showed, highlighting overheating risks that may prompt the
government to scrap the peg. 
&#8220;China is increasingly the most important, not only
emerging economy, but economy, full stop, in the world,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;These first-quarter numbers take it to being the
same size as Japan. If you look at their share of world trade,
the renminbi should definitely be a wider-used currency.&#8221; 
PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan last year said the IMF&#8217;s SDRs
offer &#8220;light in the tunnel for the reform of the international
monetary system.&#8221; SDRs are a unit of account, based on a basket
of currencies, used in IMF transactions. 
The meeting this week in Brasilia is the second heads-of-
state summit of the largest emerging economies, which includes
Brazil, Russia, India and China, or so-called BRIC nations, a
term coined by O&#8217;Neill in 2001. The leaders will discuss
broadening the array of world currencies used in international
trade as the four developing nations seek to lessen their
dependence on the U.S. dollar.

China&#8217;s stock-index futures begin
trading tomorrow, giving investors a tool to hedge against
potential risks from an overheating economy and asset bubbles. 
The contracts are part of China&#8217;s push to make more
investment options available to local investors and ease market
fluctuations after the Shanghai Composite Index slumped the most
among global markets this year following an 80 percent rally in
2009. They will be based on the CSI 300 Index, tracking the 300
biggest stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. 
&#8220;They can be used obviously for speculation but
importantly, they can also be used for hedging,&#8221; Hugh Young,
who helps oversee $232 billion of assets as head of equities at
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in Singapore, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Like all these instruments it depends on
how well you use them.&#8221; 
The Shanghai index has fallen 3.4 percent in 2010, making
it the worst performer in Asia, on concern the government will
tighten monetary policy to slow record lending growth and
soaring property prices. The government has twice this year
required banks to set aside a larger proportion of deposits as
reserves this year. The CSI 300 Index has fallen 4.8 percent. 
China&#8217;s economic growth accelerated to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, highlighting
overheating risks that may prompt the government to scrap the
yuan&#8217;s peg to the dollar. 
Asset Bubbles 
Last year&#8217;s rally in Chinese stocks and property prices
have prompted analysts including former Morgan Stanley economist
Andy Xie to call the nation&#8217;s asset markets a bubble that will
burst once the government curbs credit. China is &#8220;on a treadmill
to hell,&#8221; with growth driven by the &#8220;heroin of property
development,&#8221; hedge fund manager James Chanos said last week. 
&#8220;They do come with higher risks and volatility but I think
it&#8217;s the way markets develop,&#8221; Aberdeen&#8217;s Young said. 
The trading of stock-index futures on the China Financial
Futures Exchange in Shanghai follows the introduction of margin
trading and short selling on March 31. Shanghai, which has plans
to develop into an international financial center by 2020, may
start a board for listings by overseas companies later this year,
the China Daily newspaper reported today. 
The futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell the CSI
300 Index at a preset value on an agreed date. 
Investors need a minimum 500,000 yuan to open an account to
trade stock-index futures, according to rules by the securities
regulator and the China Financial Futures Exchange. 
Rising Liquidity 
They must pay cash deposits equivalent to 15 percent of the
contract value for May and June contracts and 18 percent for
contracts for September and December. The contract values are
points of the CSI 300 multiplied by 300 yuan and the minimum
contract price movement is 0.2 point, according to the futures
exchange. 
Trading will be at the &#8220;expensive side of fair value&#8221; as
volumes will be limited initially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in a report today. 
&#8220;Under close monitoring by authorities, we expect a
gradual increase in liquidity, but even then we do not expect a
significant direct impact on the stock market,&#8221; Christopher
Eoyang and Jason Lui, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
report. 
Trading volumes for China&#8217;s local-currency A shares should
increase with the introduction of stock index futures, Jing
Ulrich, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s chairwoman for China equities and
commodities, said last month. 
China has the world&#8217;s third largest stock market by market
capitalization, briefly overtaking Japan in July 2009. The U.S.
is the biggest by market cap. 
U.S. Challenge 
China&#8217;s increased trading in equities from index futures
will help the nation challenge the U.S. as the world&#8217;s busiest
stock market, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co. and HSBC
Jintrust Fund Management Co. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s possible for China to surpass the U.S. in terms of
trading volumes, and index futures trading is one positive
factor that&#8217;s bolstering transactions,&#8221; Liang Jing, a Shanghai-
based analyst at Guotai, the nation&#8217;s second-largest brokerage
in terms of broking revenue, said last week. 
China currently restricts overseas investors to buying B
shares that trade in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong
dollars in Shenzen. China&#8217;s yuan-denominated A shares, are
mostly limited to local investors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week, even
as the cabinet signaled caution in ending crisis policies. 
O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to highlight the
growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said in an
interview yesterday in London he was pushing up his forecast on
the move from year-end because the currency is undervalued.
China may avoid a one-time gain that might endanger exports,
while allowing gradual appreciation by June 30 to curb inflation,
a survey of economists this week by Bloomberg News showed. 
China has pegged its currency at about 6.8 to the dollar
since July 2008, which some U.S. lawmakers say gives the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy an unfair trade advantage. The
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent to 6.62 per dollar by year-
end, according to the median estimate among the 19 economists. 
&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; 
Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards strengthened 0.1
percent to 6.6161 per dollar as of 12:40 p.m. in Hong Kong. The
contracts reflect bets the currency will appreciate 3.2 percent
from the spot rate of 6.8257. 
Accelerating Economy 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
that a more flexible yuan would help the world&#8217;s third-largest
economy keep inflation under control. Bernanke, responding to
questions from Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York,
said Chinese authorities are also subject to pressure from
exporters who want to keep the yuan low against the dollar. 
China is seeking a &#8220;stable yuan&#8221; to control hot money
flows, Yao Jian, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, told
reporters today. Residential and commercial real-estate prices
in 70 cities climbed 11.7 percent in March from a year earlier,
the most since data began in 2005. 
The economy grew 11.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, more than the median 11.7 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists. The consumer-price index
gained 2.4 percent last month, compared with 2.7 percent in
February, the statistics bureau reported today. 
Cabinet Caution 
China&#8217;s cabinet said &#8220;rapid&#8221; first-quarter growth was
largely driven by stimulus policies and a comparison with a low
level a year earlier, suggesting officials may be cautious in
ending crisis policies. 
&#8220;The environment for economic development is extremely
complex,&#8221; the cabinet said in a statement on a government Web
site yesterday evening after a meeting chaired by Premier Wen
Jiabao. &#8220;The economic rebound still faces many difficulties.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is also building as
BRIC leaders get ready to meet this week in Brasilia to discuss
boosting trade in local currency and coordinating positions on
reforming the international financial system. 
&#8220;The Americans dare to speak about this,&#8221; said Stephen
Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in
Shanghai. &#8220;Other countries take a quiet line on the renminbi but
obviously those countries have exporters who would like to grow
their business as well.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised
its estimate for U.S. second-quarter economic growth to 3
percent from 2 percent and dropped its forecast for the jobless
rate to climb past 10 percent. 
U.S. unemployment will be in a range of 9.5 percent to 10
percent through the end of 2011, Ed McKelvey, the company&#8217;s
senior U.S. economist, wrote in an e-mail. The unemployment rate
was 9.7 percent in March. 
Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank,
is sticking to its view that GDP growth will slow to a 1.5
percent pace during the second half of 2010, according to the
report. 
&#8220;While our expectations for overall growth beyond mid-year
have not changed, we have modestly upgraded our forecast for
consumer spending, with offsets in housing activity, state and
local spending, trade improvement, and inventory accumulation,&#8221;
wrote McKelvey, who is based in New York.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as U.S. regulators sued the
firm for fraud related to subprime-mortgage securities. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs rose the most in a
year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the
bank misstated and omitted key facts about collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market started to falter in 2007. The SEC&#8217;s charges are
&#8220;completely unfounded,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. 
Swaps on other banks, from Deutsche Bank AG to Citigroup
Inc. and Morgan Stanley, also rose on concerns the probe may
bolster efforts in Washington to crack down on the securities
industry.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It creates uncertainty,&#8221; said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit
analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. &#8220;The real point is how it
affects regulation and oversight of the securities industry. It
does give Washington more ammunition to tighten regulation.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman climbed 35 basis points to
130.5 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. 
Swaps on Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank rose 9.5 basis
points to 93.5 basis points, the most in a year, CMA prices
show. Contracts on Morgan Stanley jumped 17.5 to 139, those on
Citigroup rose 14 to 137, and swaps on Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit increased 18.5 to 141. 
Ripple Effects 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s headline risk, and it&#8217;s not good for the whole
sector,&#8221; said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economics
research at Stamford, Connecticut-based Aladdin Capital Holdings
LLC, which oversees $12.5 billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s like someone took a
giant stone and threw it into a pond, and it&#8217;s going to ripple
outward.&#8221; 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
the most in 10 weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 87.3
basis points, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The benchmark yesterday reached the lowest since Jan. 14
after declining for the sixth straight day, CMA prices show. The
index typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and
falls as it improves.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by U.S. regulators for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations that contributed to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The firm&#8217;s shares tumbled 13 percent and
financial stocks slumped. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today. Billionaire John
Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade and wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs
vice president who helped create the CDOs, known as Abacus. 
&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was
betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which
mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while
telling other investors that the securities were selected by an
independent, objective third party.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs became emblematic of public outrage at the
banking industry after posting a record $13.4 billion
profit in 2009, a year after receiving $10 billion in
taxpayer aid during the financial crisis. It repaid the
funds in June. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has been criticized by lawmakers
and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in
helping Greece mask the size of its debts. It called the SEC&#8217;s
claims &#8220;unfounded.&#8221; 
Financial Stocks Slump 
&#8220;Civil charges and the disgorgement are not the issue --
the threat to Goldman is reputational,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The danger is
to &#8220;ultimately its market share with its prized institutional
and corporate clients.&#8221; 
Shares of Goldman Sachs, based in New York, dropped $23.57,
or 13 percent, to $160.70 as of 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading. It marked the biggest one-day decline since
Jan. 20, 2009, and pushed the value of Warren Buffett&#8217;s options
to buy Goldman Sachs shares down by $950 million. 
Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Integrity&#8217; 
Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s chief executive officer,
got the warrants on $5 billion of Goldman Sachs stock as part of
an agreement that extended financing to the bank during the
depths of the 2008 credit crisis. The deal reflected Buffett&#8217;s
belief in &#8220;not just the strength of Goldman but its
integrity,&#8221; Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director said this week
in an interview. 
The cost to protect against a default on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
debt jumped 30.5 basis points, or 0.305 percentage point, to
120.5 basis points. 
&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s charges are completely unfounded in law and
fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and
its reputation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. 
The firm put together the Abacus deal in 2007, a year in
which Goldman Sachs earned a then-record $11.6 billion, a figure
it surpassed in 2009, when it earned $13.4 billion. Goldman
Sachs paid Blankfein $68.5 million for 2007 -- $600,000 in
salary, plus a $67.9 million bonus. 
According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Tourre, now 31, sent an
e-mail to a friend in January 2007 saying, &#8220;The whole building
is about to collapse&#8221; in reference to CDOs tied to subprime
mortgages. 
&#8216;Fabulous Fab&#8217; 
&#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab standing in the
middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he
created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstrousities!!!&#8221; Tourre wrote in the e-
mail, according to the SEC. The agency didn&#8217;t identify the
recipient of the note. 
Reached at his London office today, Tourre declined to
comment. &#8220;I need to jump, thank you, goodbye,&#8221; he told
Bloomberg News before hanging up. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a
lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. Tourre,
a graduate of Ecole Centrale Paris, one of France&#8217;s top
engineering schools, and Stanford University, joined Goldman
Sachs in July 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
Goldman Sachs and Tourre knew it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to sell the CDO if they disclosed to investors that
Paulson played a significant role in selecting the collateral
and was also betting against it, the SEC said. 
&#8216;Surreal&#8217; ACA Meeting 
The bank also knew that at least one potential investor,
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t
likely to invest in a CDO that didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager
to analyze and select the portfolio, according to the complaint. 
In January 2007, Goldman Sachs approached ACA Management
LLC, a firm that analyzes credit risk, to select the portfolio
for a CDO transaction sponsored by Paulson. In an internal memo
on March 12, 2007, Goldman said it would &#8220;leverage ACA&#8217;s
credibility and franchise&#8221; to help distribute the transaction,
the SEC said. 
Paulson, Tourre and a representative from ACA met in
February 2007 to discuss assets that would be included in the
residential-mortgage backed security, the SEC said. While
Paulson and Tourre knew Paulson intended to short the security,
ACA wasn&#8217;t in the loop. 
&#8220;I am at this ACA meeting,&#8221; Tourre wrote in an e-mail to
an unidentified Goldman Sachs employee during the meeting.
&#8220;This is surreal.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Extensive Disclosure&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs also said that it lost more than $90 million
because it had an investment in the deal, overwhelming the $15
million it made in fees. The firm said it provided &#8220;extensive
disclosure&#8221; to IKB and ACA about the risk of the underlying
mortgage securities. Goldman Sachs never told ACA that Paulson
was going to be a &#8220;long&#8221; investor in Abacus, and ACA selected
the underlying securities, the firm said. 
Paulson  Co., which oversees $32 billion, said in a
statement that the fund didn&#8217;t make any misrepresentations
connected to the Abacus deal. 
&#8220;While Paulson purchased credit protection from Goldman
Sachs on securities issued under the Abacus ABS CDO program we
were not involved in the marketing of any Abacus products to any
third parties,&#8221; the New York-based firm said. &#8220;ACA as
collateral manager had sole authority over the selection of all
collateral in the CDO.&#8221; 
Paulson could be the target of investor lawsuits now that
the SEC is investigating how Abacus was put together, said
Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for two bond insurers
and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin Krieg  Adams LLP. 
&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been many investor lawsuits on these kinds
of deals,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;This opens the door to civil claims
across a number of transactions.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost at
least 4 percent today as all 27 companies in the SP 500
Diversified Financial Index declined. In Europe, Deutsche Bank
AG dropped 8 percent. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of

     April 16 (Bloomberg) --&#160;For bearish options traders, the
Securities and Exchange Commission couldn&#8217;t have picked a better
day to charge Goldman Sachs Group Inc. with fraud. 
Puts giving the right to sell Goldman shares at $175 before
today&#8217;s close, which were worth 3 cents yesterday, soared to
$14.15 for the biggest gain among options on the stock. Goldman
shares fell 13 percent to $160.70 in New York. 
&#8220;Everything moves in an exponential manner on expiration
day when you have unexpected news like this,&#8221; said Steve Quirk,
managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. in
Chicago. &#8220;This is a very good example of why you cover short
options even if they&#8217;re worthless and 10 or 20 percent away from
the current trading price near expiration.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs plunged the most in almost three months after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New York-
based firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations
that contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
The April $165 puts jumped to $4 from 1 cent yesterday.
Those contracts traded more than 29,000 times, almost double the
number of outstanding options before today.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, said it completed the world&#8217;s longest well from a
fixed offshore platform, boosting production off California. 
The well from the Heritage platform in federal waters west
of Santa Barbara reaches 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) below sea
level and extends 6.3 miles (10 kilometers) horizontally,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil said today in a statement. 
Output from the well in the Santa Inez field will be
equivalent to 5.8 million barrels of oil, enough for the annual
energy consumption of about 144,000 Californians, the company
said. Exxon Mobil and environmental groups in 1995 agreed on
measures to protect people and marine life during exploration
from its existing platforms in Santa Inez. 
The company said in a Feb. 1 conference call that the well
had been drilled a total of more than 37,000 feet, a North
American record. 
Exxon Mobil fell 33 cents to $67.93 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed
for the year.

General Growth Properties Inc. is
seeking a higher price, fewer stock warrants or both from
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. after its bankruptcy exit plan
was matched by Simon Property Group Inc., a person with
knowledge of the discussions said. 
General Growth, the second-biggest U.S. mall owner, also is
continuing to talk with larger rival Simon, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the discussions are private.
General Growth needs to decide if it will continue to back
Brookfield&#8217;s plan before a bankruptcy court hearing on the
competing proposals, scheduled for April 29. 
Simon, whose $10 billion takeover offer for General Growth
was turned down as too low in February, earlier this week
pledged to invest $2.5 billion in a reorganization of the
company and match the terms of a plan by Brookfield and partners
Fairholme Capital Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital
Management LP. Simon said its proposal is better for General
Growth shareholders than the Brookfield plan because it doesn&#8217;t
include issuing warrants that may dilute stock value. 
Brookfield &#8220;is averse to participating in bidding wars and
may not currently feel that it has to,&#8221; Cedrik Lachance, a
senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach,
California, wrote in a note to investors last night. &#8220;However,
the mathematics of recapitalizing GGP at higher prices suggests
that there is room for a higher bid.&#8221; 
Hedge fund Paulson  Co. pledged to invest $1 billion as
part of the proposal by Indianapolis-based Simon. General Growth
said this week that it will study the new offer. 
Katherine Vyse, a spokeswoman for Brookfield, declined to
comment, as did Hugh Burns, a Simon spokesman. 
Business Plan 
To win backing from General Growth, Simon needs to explain
its planned strategy for the company, the person familiar with
the talks said. Given that Simon would own a large stake in its
biggest rival, akin to Coca-Cola Co. investing in PepsiCo Inc.,
the company needs to lay out details of its multi-year business
plan for General Growth, the person said. 
Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner, said this week it&#8217;s
still willing to buy Chicago-based General Growth outright. The
$6.55 billion plan by the Brookfield-led group seeks so-called
stalking horse status at the April 29 hearing and would include
issuing stock warrants if the proposal is approved by the court,
increasing the price of any future takeover by another bidder. 
Independent Company 
General Growth would emerge from bankruptcy as an
independent company under both the Brookfield plan and Simon&#8217;s
new offer. The mall owner filed the largest real estate
bankruptcy in U.S. history one year ago after amassing $27
billion in debt making acquisitions. Its properties include New
York&#8217;s South Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand
Canal Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
Simon would buy 250 million shares at $10 each under its
new offer, which it said is the same amount Toronto-based
Brookfield would acquire under its plan and at the same price.
It would also agree to the same terms as Brookfield&#8217;s proposal
for the recapitalization of the company and planned spinoff of a
new entity, David Simon wrote in an April 14 letter to General
Growth CEO Adam Metz.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Vedika
Bhandarkar will join Credit Suisse Group AG as vice chairman
and head of investment banking operations in India, the Wall
Street bank&#8217;s second senior departure in the country in a month. 
Credit Suisse also hired JPMorgan&#8217;s Sandeep Pangal who will
report to Bhandarkar as a managing director, spokesman Adam
Harper said by phone today. Bhandarkar will report to Mihir
Doshi, Credit Suisse&#8217;s India head. 
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, which ranks 24th in advising
Indian stock sales, aims to grow the business tapping rising
investor demand for equities in the country. JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost the vice chairman of
its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last month after she left to
become country head for Bank of America Corp. 
&#8220;India is central to our strategy and we are confident
that Vedika and Sandeep can build on our momentum to take the
business to the next level,&#8221; Vikram Malhotra, Credit Suisse&#8217;s
co-head of investment banking for Asia Pacific, said in an e-
mail. 
Bhandarkar joined JPMorgan in India in 1998 and Pangal
joined the following year. While at JPMorgan the two worked
together advising on deals including NTT DoCoMo Inc.&#8217;s $2.7
billion stake in Tata Teleservices Ltd. in 2008. 
So far this year, JPMorgan is No. 8 in advising on stock
sales in India, behind firms including Citigroup Inc., UBS AG,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg
data show. 
Bhandarkar will also report to Vikram Malhotra and Helman
Sitohang, co-heads of investment banking for Asia Pacific, based
in Hong Kong and Singapore respectively.

Bo Vavrusa was heaping dirt into
the path of a wildfire on a Texas ranch in October 2007 when his
tractor rammed an Exxon Mobil Corp. natural-gas pipe hidden in a
thicket. Flames engulfed the tractor, burning his face, arms and
hands as he fled. 
&#8220;I thought I was fixing to die,&#8221; said Vavrusa, 28, who
was earning $10 an hour to groom the ranch for quail and dove
hunters. 
Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil producer, has neglected this
stretch of Texas since its oil fields began drying up in the
1970s, said Jerry Patterson, the state&#8217;s General Land Office
Commissioner. Now Patterson and other state officials are urging
Texas lawmakers to follow the examples of California and
Pennsylvania in cracking down on oilfield practices that have
left leaking pipelines, wells and storage tanks. 
Oozing chemical pits and Vavrusa&#8217;s scarred skin are
emblematic of a legacy Exxon has sought to keep buried in court,
even as it gears up for a return to active exploration within
miles of the ranch through its pending $29.3 billion acquisition
of Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. 
Exxon&#8217;s renewed focus on North America follows nationalist
energy policies in Venezuela and Russia that reduced
opportunities to profit abroad. It coincides with fresh scrutiny
in the U.S. that is leading Congress to examine whether stricter
drilling regulations are needed. 
Oil&#8217;s &#8216;Ugly Side&#8217; 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t something the states are proud to advertise,&#8221;
said Philip Dellinger, chief of the groundwater section in the
Austin, Texas, office of the Environmental Protection Agency.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the ugly side of the oil and gas business.&#8221; 
The EPA says it has no authority to force companies to
address contamination on active fields and must defer to Texas
regulators, who let oil companies determine if sites need
cleanup. 
In Pennsylvania, where the petroleum industry was born with
Edwin Drake&#8217;s 1859 discovery of crude, Governor Ed Rendell more
than doubled the number of well inspectors and has asked the
legislature to impose more than $400 million in new taxes on
companies pumping gas from the Marcellus Shale, a geologic
formation that extends from New York to Ohio and holds enough of
the fuel to supply the entire U.S. for 15 years. 
&#8220;I think the whole future of oil and gas in this country
depends on the companies having to pick up the last mess,&#8221; said
Elizabeth Burns, 43, who lives with her family on the Encinitos
Ranch where Vavrusa was injured. &#8220;Places like Pennsylvania and
New York need strong laws or this is what they&#8217;re going to
get.&#8221; 
Depression-Era Leases 
Relatives of Burns and her husband, Stephen, own the ranch
and much of the Kelsey oilfield beneath it. They&#8217;ve filed a
lawsuit against Exxon and Chevron Corp., which pumps oil and gas
on a smaller section of the spread. The suit accuses the
companies of damaging tens of thousands of acres and failing to
abide by 1930s-era leases they say require operators to keep
equipment clear of vegetation. 
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it spent $1.6 million last
year on remediation at the ranch and has conducted numerous soil
and water tests to mitigate environmental risks. 
&#8220;We are a responsible operator and refute any accusations
that suggest otherwise,&#8221; said David Eglinton, an Exxon
spokesman. &#8220;We currently have crews working to remove unneeded
facilities and, where appropriate, remediate affected areas to
applicable regulatory standards.&#8221; 
Chevron, the largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, &#8220;denies
these unsubstantiated allegations and intends to defend itself
in the litigation,&#8221; said Mickey Driver, a spokesman for the San
Ramon, California-based company. 
Expensive Slog 
If a judge finds Exxon and Chevron liable, they could be on
the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars, based on cleanup
costs incurred at other companies&#8217; oil fields in California. The
lawsuit is going to be an expensive slog, said Jeff Weems, a
Houston-based oil and gas lawyer who has represented BP PLC,
Europe&#8217;s second-biggest oil company, in Texas courts. 
&#8220;The legal route is a very long and difficult row to hoe
for an individual landowner,&#8221; said Weems, a Democrat who&#8217;s
running in November for a seat on the commission that regulates
the Texas oil and natural-gas industry. &#8220;They generally don&#8217;t
have the resources to seriously take on the big oil companies
that have legal departments that rival the largest law firms in
size and quality.&#8221; 
The Encinitos spread, located 40 miles from the Mexican
border, is dotted with scores of still-active gas pipes obscured
by brush and saplings that haven&#8217;t been cut. Beneath the dirt,
the Burns family has found leaks and dumps they blame for
undrinkable water and dead trees. 
Defunct Equipment 
Pollution from decades-old wells and waste pits isn&#8217;t
isolated to their ranch or Exxon. There are more than 100,000
old wells in Texas that haven&#8217;t been capped and thousands of
defunct gas-processing plants, compressor stations and related
equipment that have never been dismantled, according to the
Texas Land and Minerals Owners Association, which represents
1,200 ranchers, farmers and individuals who own stakes in oil
and gas fields. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty common problem in Texas,&#8221; said John B.
McFarland, an oil and gas attorney at Graves Dougherty Hearon 
Moody in Austin who has represented landowners with claims to
300,000 acres around the state. 
In Benavides, a rural town 60 miles north of the Burns&#8217;s
homestead, local officials sent residents letters in late 2008
warning them their drinking water contains as much as four-and-
a-half times as much arsenic as is considered safe by the U.S.
EPA. Arsenic can cause skin damage, circulatory problems and
cancer, the letter warned. 
Contamination Migrates 
The contamination may have migrated from a defunct oilfield
on the north end of town, where sludge and other waste from
wells was dumped in open dirt pits for decades, said J.T.
Garcia, president of the Duval County Conservation and
Reclamation District. He doesn&#8217;t know who operated the field,
which stopped pumping crude in the 1970s. 
The Burns&#8217;s ranch, which covers an area equal to the size
of Brooklyn, is just one example of the lingering environmental
damage across swaths of south, west and east Texas from what
were once regarded as acceptable oilfield practices, said
Patterson, the commissioner with the Texas General Land Office,
which oversees oil leases that help fund the state&#8217;s schools and
universities. 
&#8220;They&#8217;d just dig a pit and put the oil in it and then
they&#8217;d haul it off later, or maybe they wouldn&#8217;t haul it off
later, depending on the price of oil at the time,&#8221; said
Patterson. &#8220;That was the norm, and nobody said anything about
it.&#8221; 
Heavy Metals 
During the 1950s and &#8216;60s, oil companies filtered out some
byproducts at the wellhead and dumped the refuse in dirt pits.
That meant contaminants later buried when bulldozers covered the
holes had higher concentrations of petroleum-laced substances
and heavy metals than they otherwise would have, according to
the Burnses and an environmental survey of the ranch carried out
by Amistad Environmental LLC at the behest of the family&#8217;s
lawyers. 
Exxon, which pumps more oil than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, declined to discuss the
Burns lawsuit. The company has paid the family $19 million over
the past two decades in the form of royalties, Eglinton said.
Exxon has invested $190 million in development of the field
since the lease was signed in 1935, extracting 130 million
barrels of crude and 980 billion cubic feet of gas during that
time. 
The company&#8217;s presence in south Texas has enriched ranchers
and their communities, Eglinton said. Exxon paid $890 million in
taxes and royalties to the state in 2008, and Brooks County,
where the largest chunk of the Encinitos Ranch sits, relies on
oil and other mineral taxes for 70 percent of its school and
local government budgets, he said. 
Price of Pollution 
Those benefits came with a price measured in pollution that
has languished, partly because state laws and regulatory
agencies aren&#8217;t designed or equipped to police environmental
performance in the oil patch, said Weems and other critics. 
The Texas Railroad Commission that oversees the state&#8217;s oil
and natural-gas industry allows companies to hire their own
environmental consultants to check for contamination. Tests on
the Burns property conducted for Exxon by Netherlands-based
Arcadis NV gave the site a clean bill of health, said Ramona
Nye, a spokeswoman for the Austin-based commission. 
Elizabeth Burns had a different assessment. 
&#8220;They buried it, muck and all,&#8221; she said. 
Jeanna Blatt, a Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based spokeswoman
for Arcadis, declined to comment. 
OPEC&#8217;s Predecessor 
The railroad commission, created in 1891 to regulate
shipping rates, had its authority expanded to the nascent Texas
oil industry in the early 1900s, when rampant drilling glutted
world markets with crude and prices tumbled. 
The commission began restricting how much each well in the
state could produce, in a bid to prevent another free-fall in
prices. When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
was formed in 1960, the railroad commission was its model,
according to the Texas State Historical Association. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a mistake to have an agency that was originally set
up to serve the industry now being asked to police the industry
as its environmental regulator,&#8221; said McFarland, the oil and
gas attorney. 
The Texas legislature isn&#8217;t inclined to crack down on the
oil industry either, said Kelly Mcbeth, a legislative strategist
at Texas Energy Lobby, an Austin-based firm that represents
petroleum companies. Even wells that produce just a trickle of
oil or gas are revenue generators for the state. 
&#8216;An Economic Driver&#8217; 
&#8220;Legislators do everything they can to keep those wells on
line,&#8221; Mcbeth said. &#8220;They&#8217;re an economic driver for us.&#8221; 
The EPA doesn&#8217;t intervene in pollution cases on active
oilfields in Texas, said Dave Bary, a spokesman for EPA Region
6, which encompasses Texas, four other states and 65 American
Indian tribes. 
&#8220;The railroad commission has primacy over active
oilfields,&#8221; Bary said. 
Exxon, which had 2009 sales of $276 billion that dwarfed
the economic output of all but 33 of the world&#8217;s nations, wants
to seal the records in the Burns lawsuit, filed in December
2007. If Judge Richard C. Terrell of Texas&#8217;s 79th Judicial
District grants the company&#8217;s request, it would shield from
public view the details of how the company has operated on the
land. 
&#8220;The mindset of a major oil company is that they shouldn&#8217;t
have to compromise and you should be scared of them,&#8221; said
Roger S. Braugh Jr., the Sico, White, Hoelscher  Braugh LLC
attorney representing the Burns family. &#8220;To prove our case,
ultimately we&#8217;re looking at spending tens of millions of dollars
on environmental studies.&#8221; 
Off the Land 
The suit demands unspecified cleanup costs and seeks to kick
the oil companies off the land for breaching leases signed in
the 1930s, said Braugh, who&#8217;s based in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Vavrusa, the former ranch hand who now works for a company
that tests pipeline meters, sued Exxon and the ranch for
unspecified damages. Exxon failed to cut the vegetation that hid
the gas line from view, and the ranch family didn&#8217;t warn him the
line was there, he claimed in his suit. 
Exxon&#8217;s Eglinton said it was premature for the company to
comment on that suit. 
Cleaning up a contaminated oil patch involves either
excavating the soil and trucking it away, or fencing off the
area to keep people out, said John Evans, chief civil engineer
for Cannon Associates, a San Luis Obispo, California-based
remediation firm. 
California Cleaning 
In California, the third-biggest oil-producing state after
Texas and Alaska, state agencies and regulators have been
pushing oil companies to clean up old fields. 
Unocal Corp. was forced to spend $100 million to dig up a
half-mile of oceanfront and to demolish and rebuild eight blocks
of Avila Beach, California, starting in 1995 after subterranean
pipelines leaked crude, gasoline and diesel, said Evans, who
worked on the project. 
The cleanup stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, according to a Unocal
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A yacht
club, retail stores and pier had to be rebuilt at the company&#8217;s
expense. Unocal is now part of Chevron. 
At another former Unocal operation in California, the
state&#8217;s Department of Fish and Game, the water quality board and
the Department of Toxic Substances Control successfully sued the
company over contamination of the Guadalupe field 160 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, public filings showed. 
Kerosene Leaks 
The cleanup so far has cost $200 million to $300 million
since digging began in 1994, Evans said. Before the field was
shut in the mid 1990s, Unocal used kerosene to loosen deposits
of thick crude. The kerosene pipes leaked, polluting the soil
and flowing into the ocean, he said. 
Eglinton, the Exxon spokesman, said the Unocal cleanups in
California may have little in common with conditions in south
Texas. &#8220;These are two completely different places,&#8221; he said. 
In Pennsylvania, the state has responded to a boom in gas
drilling by Exxon and others with stepped-up inspections of well
sites. The intent is to ensure the holes are properly lined with
steel pipe and concrete to protect local water supplies from
chemicals used to penetrate rock formations and saltwater that
gurgles to the surface with the gas, said John Hanger, secretary
of the state&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection. 
Pennsylvania Scars 
&#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s had a long, long history with natural-
resources extraction, going back some 300 years with coal and an
oil industry that began in the 1800s,&#8221; said Hanger, who before
heading the agency was CEO of Citizens for Pennsylvania&#8217;s
Future, a non-profit group that promotes renewable energy and
conservation. &#8220;Those industries left some scars on the natural
landscape, and we&#8217;re still paying considerable sums of money to
repair some of that damage.&#8221; 
From the 1930s through the 1970s, the Kelsey field in south
Texas attracted hundreds of roughnecks, engineers and their
families. They lived in a work camp that had gardens, a school,
swim club and the Cactus Club snack bar that specialized in
wood-smoked barbecue, the Burnses said. 
Humble Oil and Texaco, which were subsumed into Exxon and
Chevron, drilled 555 wells on the ranch and laid thousands of
miles of pipe to funnel crude to refineries in other parts of
Texas. 
Poisonous Toads 
Today the Encinitos Ranch, which sprawls across parts of
three counties, is home to poisonous Marine toads and
rattlesnakes. The fat brown toads, when captured, are tossed
into a pond to prevent the household dogs from eating them and
dying; rattlesnakes are shot and hung over a fence for good
luck. The dogs have scars from fighting with coyotes. 
Stephen Burns, 39, wears a holstered handgun around the
ranch for protection against drug smugglers who avoid Border
Patrol agents prowling the highways by following pipeline routes
that crisscross the property. 
His wife, Elizabeth, estimates Exxon has damaged 12,000 to
14,000 acres of the 31,000 acres it holds under the 1935 lease
by burying wastes left by oil production and allowing byproducts
to leak into the soil. Chevron has damaged about 4,000 of the
7,100 acres it operates under a lease that dates to 1934, she
said. 
Her first clash with Exxon had nothing to do with oil. In
October 2006, police discovered that a Mexico-based drug cartel
was using the abandoned Cactus Club as a way-station for
couriers armed with machine guns. The authorities asked the
Burns to have Exxon tear it down. 
The company declined the family&#8217;s requests, Burns said. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil can&#8217;t comment on the alleged 2006 request as
we don&#8217;t have any information about it,&#8221; said Margaret Ross, a
spokeswoman. &#8220;There is no current request from the landowner.&#8221; 
Bubbling Road 
Burns began to focus on the decaying oilfield
infrastructure after a second wildfire in March 2008 scorched
most of the landscape, exposing the rusty pipes and other aging
equipment spanning the ranch. That same month, an asphalt road
on the ranch that ran alongside a former oil-storage site began
to bubble with petroleum gases. Burns said she complained to
Exxon and to the railroad commission. 
Four months later, she triggered a radiation sensor clipped
to the belt of a U.S. Border Patrol agent at McAllen Miller
International Airport before boarding a flight to Houston. The
agent determined the culprit was dirt on the soles of her boots
laced with old crude and chemicals tracked in from the ranch.
Since then, she said, she&#8217;s been calling and emailing the
railroad commission about twice a week with contamination
complaints. 
Addressing Concerns 
&#8220;Commission staff is in regular contact with Elizabeth
Burns and has been working with her since November 2008 to
address her concerns,&#8221; Nye said in an e-mailed statement. 
A &#8220;majority&#8221; of Burns&#8217; complaints have been &#8220;addressed
and resolved,&#8221; Nye said. The five that remain open involve
storage tank and pipeline leaks that the commission is
monitoring &#8220;to assure that cleanups are completed within a
reasonable time frame,&#8221; the spokeswoman said. 
After the Burnses complained, Exxon dug up the road, which
crossed a network of 44 pipelines. In October, a 9-foot deep
hole about the size of a two-car garage remained, with a pool of
brown muck at the bottom that had the smell and tell-tale
rainbow sheen of petroleum. 
Fifty yards from where the road once ran, Stephen Burns
used a backhoe to dig a 6-foot trench in the soil. Within
seconds, a clear liquid that reeked of motor fuel trickled down
the sides of the hole. A clump of the dirt felt and smelled like
the boggy sand that is mined for oil in Alberta, Canada. 
Exxon filled in the bubbling-road hole in December and
covered it with caliche, Burns said. 
Benzene Found 
The survey done in 2008 for the family found dangerously
high levels of petroleum derivatives such as benzene, as well as
mercury and lead, in soil and water samples from the surface to
at least 40 feet down. 
The family stopped using its tap water after seeing those
results. Now they get their water once a week in 5-gallon jugs
from a Farm and Ranch store in San Isidro, Texas, about 40 miles
away. 
Although lighter-weight hydrocarbons can degrade naturally
in 40 or 50 years, the heavier molecules &#8220;are more persistent
and pretty toxic,&#8221; said Gregory Miller, project manager at Icon
Environmental Services Inc., a Port Allen, Louisiana-based
company that cleans up old oilfields. &#8220;You have no idea how bad
some of these sites are.&#8221; 
Daunting Task 
Patterson said cleaning up a tract as large as the
Encinitos Ranch is impossible. Instead, the best solution may be
to fence it off and monitor the pollution to ensure it doesn&#8217;t
migrate underground to other ranches. 
&#8220;We need to somehow encapsulate it, monitor it, clean up
the obvious hazards, whether they&#8217;re fire hazards, whether
they&#8217;re leakage hazards,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you
can totally remediate that many acres. It&#8217;s not doable. It&#8217;s
just too big.&#8221; 
Exxon has installed water-monitoring stations at the ranch,
said Eglinton, the company spokesman. He declined to release the
results of the tests performed thus far. 
Oil companies would be better off cleaning up their old
operations in south Texas, Patterson said, rather than waiting
for regulators or the state legislature to impose a solution. 
&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s walked away from a lot of this stuff they built
here, but the evil lurks,&#8221; said Burns, who had planned to raise
organic vegetables when she and her husband moved to the ranch
with their sons five years ago. &#8220;You&#8217;d hope your kids can do
something with this land, but now it&#8217;s worthless.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. is near an
agreement to sell its Miramax film unit in a deal that would put
brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein back in charge of the studio
they founded, said a person with knowledge of the plan. 
The Weinsteins, who are working with billionaire Ron
Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa Cos., entered into exclusive negotiations with
Disney on April 16 as the sides work on a restructured proposal,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Their offer was increased to $625 million
from $600 million, the person said. 
A deal would reunite the Weinsteins, the executives behind
&#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; and Oscar winner &#8220;The English Patient,&#8221; with
the studio they named after their parents and left in 2005 to
start Weinstein Co. Disney would replenish its coffers after
paying more than $4 billion for comic-book publisher Marvel
Entertainment. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is focusing
the movie division on family oriented movies. 
Exclusivity lasts for less than a week, the person said.
Burbank, California-based Disney acquired Miramax in 1993 and
had sought $700 million for the studio and its 700-film library.
The Weinsteins earned 220 Academy Award nominations for Disney
during their tenure, for films including &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; &#8220;The Aviator&#8221; and &#8220;Life Is Beautiful.&#8221; 
Colbeck Capital Management and Fortress Investment Group
are providing funding for the Miramax offer, The New York Times
reported on April 16. The exclusive talks were reported earlier
by TheWrap.com. 
Gores Brothers 
Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman for New York-based Weinstein
Co., declined to comment. Frank Quintero, a spokesman for
Burkle&#8217;s Los Angeles-based Yucaipa, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, said in January
that it closed Miramax offices, and that it would distribute the
six remaining pictures. The Weinsteins founded the company in
1979 and named it after their parents, Miriam and Max. 
Alec Gores and Tom Gores, billionaires who each run Los
Angeles-based private equity companies, have raised their bid
above the $550 million originally offered, said one person. They
are being advised by their brother Sam Gores, owner of Paradigm
Talent Agency in Beverly Hills, California. 
A spokesman for the Gores, Michael Sitrick, declined to
comment. 
Hollywood film producer David Bergstein has also offered
about $650 million, according to two people with knowledge of
the bid. 
Bergstein is advising a &#8220;well-capitalized offshore
entity&#8221; on a Miramax bid, his Pangea Media Group said in on
April 8. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 57 cents to
$35.83 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on April 16.
Its shares have climbed 11 percent this year.

International Business Machines
Corp. said service contract signings fell last quarter,
suggesting corporate customers are still delaying some
technology spending following the economic slowdown. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Application-management
signings declined 23 percent. 
IBM shares have lagged behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index this year. The company, the world&#8217;s largest computer-
services provider, has yet to signal that its profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than by measures like cost cuts
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; said Marshall, who has a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock and doesn&#8217;t own it. &#8220;IBM is simply
not that attractive of a growth story right now.&#8221; 
IBM fell 2.2 percent to $129.35 in after-hours trading
after rising $1.60 to $132.23 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. It has gained 1 percent this year, compared with a 7.4
percent gain in the SP 500. 
Excluding the decline in application-management signings,
total services signings would have been up 4 percent from a year
earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s slower growth than the 9
percent increase in the fourth quarter. 
Stock Buybacks 
Since 2002, IBM has repurchased $68.5 billion of stock to
help buoy profit. The buyback program shows &#8220;really good
financial management from an earnings perspective,&#8221; Marshall
said. &#8220;At the end of the day -- not much upside from a revenue
perspective.&#8221; 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221;
and doesn&#8217;t own any. 
IBM has cut about 2,900 jobs this year, according to
advocacy group Alliance@IBM, which represents some employees.
That&#8217;s on top on the more than 10,400 let go in the U.S. and
Canada last year, the group said, as the company coped with a
drop in sales. 
2010 Forecast 
The company should benefit as technology spending climbs
1.7 percent this year, after a 3.1 percent last year, according
to a projection from Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest
chipmaker, lent support to that prediction last week by
forecasting second-quarter sales that topped estimates. 
Full-year profit at IBM will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share, the company said.
Analysts on average estimated $11.13 based on estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in higher-
margin software and services. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross
profit margins, the percentage of revenue left after production
costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Software and services now make up more than 80 percent of
total revenue, which was $95.8 billion last year. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. The U.S. government&#8217;s plan to put patient health
records online may spur more than $20 billion in spending,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.

It&#8217;s not just the profits that pile
up at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. So do the scandals. 
Over the last year, the bank has been beaten up in the
court of public opinion. Last week&#8217;s fraud charges from the
Securities and Exchange Commission merely added to the battering
its reputation has already taken. Most of us would rather own up
to working for a tobacco company, with subsidiaries in landmine
manufacturing, than have anything to do with Goldman. 
It is well on the way to becoming the world&#8217;s most hated
company. And yet, there is an interesting twist to this tale.
Among the people who probably matter to it most, Goldman Sachs
is doing better than ever. 
Smart, ambitious graduates are still sending in their CVs
as enthusiastically as ever. The big corporations still want the
New York-based firm on their side. And it posted record earnings
in 2009 while its stock price doubled. 
There is a lesson in that for Wall Street investment banks.
While spending millions on an army of public-relations officers,
reputation consultants and sponsorship managers, financial
institutions shouldn&#8217;t forget that people prefer their bankers
to be greedy and mean. Being known for having sharp teeth, along
with a nasty bark, won&#8217;t do you any harm. None of the scandals
has hurt its business. This latest one won&#8217;t be any different. 
Public Beating 
No one can have failed to notice the beating that bankers
have taken in public opinion in the past two years. Real-estate
agents have a better reputation for honesty, and parking
inspectors have a higher rating for fairness. 
No surprises there. The banks took huge and crazy risks,
got ordinary taxpayers to bail them out, then went straight back
to paying themselves massive bonuses as if nothing had happened.
If that doesn&#8217;t send your reputation straight into the gutter,
it is hard to know what will. 
There is plenty of statistical evidence to show banks have
plummeted in public esteem. In Harris Interactive&#8217;s latest
survey of corporate reputations in the U.S., the banks took a
hammering. Out of 60 companies, Goldman Sachs ranked 56th.
Citigroup Inc. was at 57th, while Bank of America Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. were also in the bottom 10. Only the
tobacco industry fared worse than finance. You can&#8217;t sink much
lower than that. 
That, however, is what Joe Public thinks. Among the
corporate and political elite the story is rather different. 
Top of Polls 
A British survey, conducted by the graduate-recruitment Web
site TargetJobs, asked 100,000 students which companies they
would like to work for when they graduate. Goldman Sachs topped
the poll for investment banks. All that terrible press, it
seems, hasn&#8217;t stopped young people wanting to get their feet
under a desk in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offices. 
Likewise, Fortune magazine recently published its annual
survey of the most-admired companies. Who topped the megabank
category? That&#8217;s right. Goldman Sachs. It was up from 15th to
eighth place in the all-industries ranking, ahead of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. 
Fortune canvasses the views of more than 4,000 executives,
directors and analysts to compile its list. It is a measure of
elite, not mass opinion. And in that narrow world, it appears
that the big banks haven&#8217;t suffered at all. 
The message couldn&#8217;t be clearer. An avalanche of bad
publicity hasn&#8217;t really dented Goldman&#8217;s reputation, or that of
any other major bank, either. 
Nasty and Tough 
There are two conclusions to be drawn from that. 
First, we like our banks to be aggressive and mean. Imagine
you were hiring a bodyguard or a divorce lawyer. Do you want one
who promises to be conciliatory, kind and consensual? Or one who
takes no prisoners? In reality, you want your team to be as
nasty and tough as possible. The same is true of investment
banking. As gangster rappers say, it pays to be bad. 
Second, although there is a lot of waffling about
reputation and corporate social responsibility, all that matters
is the ability to get the job done. The firm of Nero, Khan (as
in Genghis)  Capone would probably win a fair bit of business
as long as it got that Greek bond issue sold, or found someone
to unwind a position in Florida mortgage derivatives. 
There is a moral in that for the investment banks. 
They will all spend fortunes in the next couple of years
getting their images back in shape. If you happen to have an
orchestra you want sponsored, an orphanage that needs a new
wing, or a rare species that needs saving from extinction, this
is the right moment to send in a polite letter asking for a
donation. Don&#8217;t forget to mention how their generosity will
improve their public image. They will write out a check faster
than you can say &#8220;giant vampire squid.&#8221; 
Two Audiences 
But actually, for keeping the business going, there are
only two audiences that really count. 
While the banks can still attract the smartest, most
ambitious young talent out of the universities, and so long as
the people running big corporations still rate them, what the
general public thinks doesn&#8217;t matter much. 
And while the banks are repairing their images, it would
also be worth remembering that they don&#8217;t want to go too far in
the other direction. It won&#8217;t really do them any harm to be
known as nasty and greedy -- that is what bankers are there for.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Richard
Kinder and the private-equity firms that bought Kinder Morgan
Inc. in 2007 have gained at least 126 percent return on a pretax
basis from their $7.8 billion equity investment, according to
CreditSights Inc. 
Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle Group, American
International Group Inc., Riverstone Holdings LLC and Kinder co-
founder Richard Kinder, agreed to pay $14.4 billion for the
operator of North American oil and natural-gas pipelines in
August 2006. While the deal was struck at the height of the
leveraged takeover boom, it stands out as bondholders haven&#8217;t
taken losses, said Andy DeVries, a CreditSights analyst in New
York. 
&#8220;This LBO remains one of the most unique of the 2005-07
LBO boom,&#8221; DeVries wrote in an April 18 report. In August, he
calculated the buyout equity investment had gained 69 percent. 
Kinder Morgan is the general partner of Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership that
operates or owns an interest in more than 35,000 miles of
pipelines. Chief Executive Officer Kinder and other managers at
the firm contributed $2.9 billion of the $7.8 billion equity
investment. 
Larry Pierce, a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners spokesman,
and Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls seeking comment.

The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; 
The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. 
&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; 
The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; 
 Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. 
Citigroup, WaMu 
The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy. 
Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, in response to subpoenas and document requests has
provided information to the SEC and state attorneys general in
addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who collected reports from
it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for the company in New
York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. 
&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; 
The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. 
&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; 
The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. 
Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets 
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. 
The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. 
&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; 
The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. 
&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; 
More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. 
Magnetar Deals 
Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. 
Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. 
His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. 
Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. 
Not Insisting 
Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. 
While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; 
Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. 
&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. 
Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. 
The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. 
Synthetic CDOs 
CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. 
The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Cummings, DeFazio 
Democratic Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter DeFazio said today they would ask SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro to
review whether Goldman Sachs CDOs insured by American
International Group Inc. were improperly created. AIG, rescued
by the U.S. in 2008, covered $6 billion of assets through Abacus
deals. 
Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. 
The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. 
Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. 
One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. 
&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; 
The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; 
In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. 
Goldman Sachs Response 
ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. 
&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; 
Buyer Beware 
Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. 
&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; 
Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few. 
In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. 
The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. 
&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; 
&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; 
IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. 
&#8216;Far More Sophisticated&#8217; 
&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; 
Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. 
&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said.

The cost to protect against losses
on bank bonds jumped for the second day amid speculation that
U.S. fraud charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may trigger
similar probes or lawsuits and embolden lawmakers&#8217; efforts to
crack down on financial firms. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman reached the highest in two
months as U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to follow the U.S. Securities
Exchange Commission and start a probe, and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said her nation&#8217;s financial regulator asked the
SEC for details on its Goldman suit. Swaps on banks including
Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG jumped. 
&#8220;If these charges are damning enough to actually cause
some instability in the markets, nobody really believes Goldman
is the only one that might be guilty here,&#8221; said Brian
Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at broker-dealer
Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
The SEC last week said New York-based Goldman sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing that a hedge fund that was betting against
the debt had helped select underlying securities. Goldman said
in a statement last week that the charges are &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; CDOs pool bonds, loans and other fixed-income
assets into securities of varying risk and return. 
Bank Swaps 
Credit swaps protecting Goldman debt for five years jumped
7 basis points to 134 basis points after earlier trading as high
as 140 basis points, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.
It&#8217;s the biggest two-day increase in a year, CMA DataVision
prices show. 
Contracts on Citigroup jumped 16 basis points to 138,
Deutsche Bank rose 4.5 to 98, Morgan Stanley climbed 17 to 153
and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit rose 18 to 159,
CMA prices show. 
&#8220;The fear is that this will make regulations even tighter,
increase the potential for fines and other judgments and push
down bank profits in the near term,&#8221; said Jeffrey Burch, co-
head of global credit at Investec Asset Management in London. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
to the highest in four weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 1.8 basis point to a mid-price of 89.13
basis points as of 11:03 a.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
Legislative Outlook 
The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies rose 3 basis points to 82.9, Markit prices show. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
The Goldman Sachs suit may embolden lawmakers who want to
hold Wall Street firms accountable for the financial crisis that
sparked the worst recession since the Great Depression, said
John Anderson, head of credit at Gartmore Investment Management
in London. 
Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, released a
bill last week that would limit derivatives trading by
commercial banks, barring dealers in swaps from taking advantage
of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount lending window, emergency
liquidity functions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s
insurance and guarantee functions. 
&#8216;Red Meat&#8217; 
President Barack Obama said in his weekly address on radio
and the Internet that his plan to overhaul U.S. financial
regulation is the only way to prevent the &#8220;turmoil that ripped
through our economy over the past two years.&#8221;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The perception was that banks were returning to
profitability and that everything in the garden was rosy,&#8221;
Anderson said. &#8220;But Obama has set his sights on the banking
community, and the regulators want some red meat.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due in 2020 are the most-
traded U.S. corporate notes today, falling 1.03 cents on the
dollar to 98.56 cents to yield 178 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries as of 10:51 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data show. 
Citigroup said first-quarter profit more than doubled,
beating analysts&#8217; estimates as the global economic rebound
trimmed costs for bad loans and boosted revenue from consumer
banking. 
The bank&#8217;s 6.01 percent bonds due in 2015 fell 0.3 cent on
the dollar to 106 cents, a spread of 209.2 basis points, Trace
data show. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 5.5 percent notes due in 2020 declined 1.4
cent to 97.42 cents, a spread of 206.9 basis points, Trace data
show.

The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; 
The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. 
&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; 
The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. 
Citigroup, WaMu 
The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy before the market crashed. 
Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, has provided information to the SEC and state
attorneys general in addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who
collected reports from it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for
the company in New York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. 
&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; 
The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a
securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. 
&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; 
The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. 
Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets 
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by
John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. 
The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James
Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. 
&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; 
The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. 
&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; 
More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit,
Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. 
Magnetar Deals 
Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. 
Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. 
His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. 
Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. 
Not Insisting 
Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. 
While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; 
Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. 
&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. 
Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. 
The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. 
Synthetic CDOs 
CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. 
The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Aquarius 2006-1 
Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. 
The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. 
Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. 
One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. 
&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; 
The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; 
In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. 
ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. 
&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs Response 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; 
Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. 
&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; 
Default Swaps 
Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. 
The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. 
&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; 
&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; 
IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. 
&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob
Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; 
Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. 
&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s fraud suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may
trigger additional probes of collateralized debt obligations and
lead to stricter regulation, analysts and academics said. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages without
disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick
the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle. Investors
including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Germany&#8217;s IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about $1 billion from the trade.
Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. 
&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as other
financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously very
worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it could
well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry. Regulators
may probe other CDOs that lost money for investors and could
probe other investment banks involved in the business, Raul
Sinha, a London-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in
a report published today. The suit may also strengthen political
pressure for more regulation of derivatives and similar complex
financial structures, threatening earnings, analysts said.

Just how out-of-touch can Lloyd Blankfein be? 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive officer
vigorously denied the Securities and Exchange Commission fraud
suit filed Friday against his firm, calling the complaint
&#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; The company promised
to &#8220;defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
But head-in-the-sand denials will no longer work. If
Blankfein wants to save what is left of Goldman&#8217;s reputation,
and possibly his job, he should admit that the deal described in
the SEC complaint was wrong. Then, he should draw a very firm
line so that Goldman doesn&#8217;t deceive its customers again. 
As only someone from Mars doesn&#8217;t know by now, Goldman
allegedly sold collateralized debt obligations, or bonds backed
by mortgage securities, to institutional investors without
disclosing that the specific securities were handpicked by
hedge-fund manager John Paulson. Paulson was betting on the
securities to fall and, for that reason, structured the
securities to include losers -- not winners. 
For instance, he ordered that no bonds backed by Wells
Fargo  Co. mortgages be included in the pool because Wells
Fargo was one of the few mortgage lenders that stuck to sound
lending. 
Goldman says it had no idea whether the mortgage securities
would go up or down. Maybe. But the SEC complaint quotes a
Goldman employee, also named as a defendant, gleefully
chortling, &#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime
now.&#8221; By the time the deal closed, in April 2007, the subprime
market was already in trouble. Defaults were skyrocketing. And
by the following January, no fewer than 99 percent of the
mortgages in the CDO had been downgraded. 
&#8216;Paulson Portfolio&#8217; 
Goldman says it lost $90 million on the deal. If true, that
might be its strongest defense. 
However, Goldman&#8217;s investment forecast matters less than
its allegedly faulty disclosure. Internally, it referred to the
bonds at issue as &#8220;the Paulson portfolio.&#8221; But outside
investors weren&#8217;t told that this much-respected -- and much-
feared -- short-seller had selected the bonds, or even that he
was involved. Instead, Goldman recruited a neutral third party
to bless the deal, and investors were told that this party, ACA
Management LLC, had selected the mortgages. 
It might be that every fact in the SEC complaint is untrue,
in which case Blankfein is right to defend and I am dead wrong.
But the complaint is rich in detail, and builds on a book,
Gregory Zuckerman&#8217;s &#8220;The Greatest Trade Ever,&#8221; and on
exclusive reporting in the New York Times that laid out a
similar story. 
Looking Ugly 
If the SEC&#8217;s facts are true, the case is ugly for Goldman.
In capsule form: At Paulson&#8217;s urging, Goldman structured a
security so Paulson could short the mortgage market. Goldman
found patsies to take the other side, and Paulson paid the firm
a $15 million fee. 
Goldman&#8217;s behavior reminds me of NBC television, which in
1992 aired a video of a pickup truck explosion that turned out
to have been staged. After a lawsuit by General Motors Co., NBC
apologized on air. 
In the present case, Goldman staged a CDO to explode. 
Another example: in 1991, a Salomon Brothers trader lied to
the government. Though no investor fraud was involved, the CEO,
John Gutfreund, was forced to resign merely because he had
waited a few months before reporting the incident. The new
interim CEO, Warren Buffett, publicly apologized. He insisted
then that in the future Salomon Brothers would be &#8220;way, way
away from the line.&#8221; He wanted it to steer clear of any
behavior that was even remotely questionable, much less illegal. 
Word From Buffett 
Should Goldman aspire to any less? The same Buffett&#8217;s
Berkshire Hathaway is an investor in Goldman. It would be nice
to hear Buffett endorse his principles with respect to Goldman
now. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Berkshire.) 
Either way, Blankfein should deliver a public apology.
Stonewalling, dissembling or parsing the facts won&#8217;t restore
Goldman&#8217;s name. Goldman may also have to settle with investors
who lost money on this and any similar deals. It will cost
Goldman money but it will be worth it. 
Finally, Goldman needs to look in the mirror and ask how a
firm long known for its stellar reputation and ethics could have
gone so wrong. My own theory is that three steps in the firm&#8217;s
evolution eroded the class that Goldman once stood for. 
Going Public 
First, when the firm was sold, ending its days as a
partnership, in 1999, managers gradually began to think of
Goldman as a public stock rather than their private firm. 
Second, Goldman became more of a trader, less an investment
banker. Bankers think long-term, traders short-term. Last year,
76 percent of its revenue was from trading and for investing for
its own account. 
Finally, the shift toward trading was duplicated in
Goldman&#8217;s upper management, which formerly was divided between
both camps. Since Blankfein took over in 2006, traders have
dominated. 
Goldman, of course, will say it still cares about
reputation. Tell that to IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. In 2006,
the German bank specifically told Goldman it was no longer
comfortable investing in CDOs that didn&#8217;t &#8220;utilize a collateral
manager, meaning an independent third-party,&#8221; according to the
SEC&#8217;s complaint. Goldman told IKB it had such a manager -- ACA.
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson. IKB lost almost all of its $150
million investment. 
Goldman&#8217;s exploded CDO already may have changed the future
of Wall Street. The case seems certain to speed financial
overhaul legislation through Congress. The question is whether
that CDO will change -- or threaten -- the future of Goldman as
well.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. faces a
regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from the German
government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued the firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called April 17 for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for
details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel
said. 
Politicians who were forced to bail out banks during the
financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. 
&#8220;We will see politicians throughout the world piling on
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Scott Moeller, a former investment banker
now teaching at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;Now they have
vulnerability. Everyone and anyone, especially politicians, are
going to be trying to make hay with this one.&#8221; 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. 
The firm denies any wrongdoing. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs, and Heidi Ashley, a spokeswoman for the FSA,
declined to comment.

New Suits 
Goldman Sachs Sued by SEC for Fraud Tied to CDOs 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by U.S. regulators for
fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations that contributed
to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
firm&#8217;s shares tumbled as much as 16 percent and financial stocks
slumped. 
Goldman Sachs misstated and omitted key facts about a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market was starting to falter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement April 16. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president. 
&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said in the statement. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a
client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily
influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment
portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities
were selected by an independent, objective third party.&#8221; 
The SEC alleged that Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, structured and marketed CDOs that
hinged on the performance of subprime mortgage-backed
securities. The New York-based firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the selection of securities
for the portfolio, the SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas Van Praag didn&#8217;t return a
call and an e-mail seeking comment. A call to Richard Klapper,
an attorney for Goldman Sachs at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, wasn&#8217;t
returned. Tourre, reached by phone in London April 16, declined
to comment. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at
Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. 
Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for New York-based Paulson 
Co., said he couldn&#8217;t comment. The company oversees $32 billion.

Ex-Blackwater President Indicted on Weapons Charges 
The former president of Blackwater Worldwide Inc., the
military contractor now called Xe Services LLC, was charged with
illegal possession of machine guns and falsifying documents. 
Gary Jackson, 52, and four other former Blackwater
officials were indicted April 16 in federal court in Raleigh,
North Carolina. They are accused of using sheriff department
stationery to buy AK 47s and other guns for Blackwater&#8217;s
training facility to get around restrictions on the number of
fully automatic weapons permitted in their inventory. 
The indictment also charges the five with falsifying
documents to make it appear that weapons Blackwater gave the
king of Jordan and his entourage in 2005, during a visit to the
Moyock, North Carolina, training facility, were purchased by the
defendants. 
They are also accused of putting short barrels on rifles
for use in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Blackwater provided
security services for the U.S., without registering them as such
and obstructing an investigation into the altered weapons. 
Kenneth Bell, a lawyer for Jackson, and Stacy DeLuke, a
spokeswoman for Xe, didn&#8217;t return calls for comment. 
The case is U.S. v. Gary Jackson, 10-8, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of North Carolina (Raleigh.) 
Ex-Credit Agricole Banker Sues on Bonus Exchange Rate 
A former Credit Agricole SA banker responsible for
derivatives is suing over the exchange rate the bank used to
convert his bonus from euros to pounds. 
Peter Ollila, formerly an executive director in sales
covering derivatives and securitized products for Nordic
countries and Poland, is seeking at least $96,000, plus
interest, from the Paris-based bank, according to a London
lawsuit made public this week. 
Ollila, who worked for the bank from Feb. 1, 2008, until
Nov. 21, 2008, said he is owed 33,000 pounds ($51,000) because
Credit Agricole converted his 327,500-euro ($443,000) bonus
using 2007 exchange rates rather than 2008 rates. He is also
seeking a 33,865 euro deferred payment, which he said he never
received. 
&#8220;It was an implied term&#8221; of the contract that Credit
Agricole would determine the exchange rate &#8220;reasonably and in
good faith and that the defendant&#8217;s exercise of its discretion
would not be irrational or perverse,&#8221; Ollila said in the
lawsuit that was originally filed in March. 
A Credit Agricole spokeswoman in Paris didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment. 
The case is Peter Ollila v. Credit Agricole Corporate 
Investment Bank, claim no. 2010/893, High Court of Justice,
Queens Bench Division (London).

Miami Beach Hotel Developers Charged With Hiding Funds 
A pair of Miami Beach hotel developers were arrested and
charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service
by hiding more than $45 million in offshore accounts. 
Mauricio Cohen Assor and his son Leon Cohen Levy, who built
residential hotels under the Flatotel name, never told the IRS
about proceeds of the $33 million sale in 2000 of a New York
hotel, according to a complaint in federal court in Miami. Cohen
Assor also used offshore nominee accounts to hide the ownership
of a Swiss account at an international bank that held $45.6
million in 2004, according to the complaint. 
The men were arrested in New York April 15, the deadline
for filing federal tax returns for 2009, as the Justice
Department also charged seven former UBS AG clients with tax
crimes for hiding funds abroad. The developers were detained
after an initial appearance in federal court in Manhattan. 
The two also used bank accounts in the name of their
business, American Leisure Resorts, to fund a &#8220;luxury
lifestyle&#8221; for themselves and family members, according to the
complaint. They paid for &#8220;lavish personal residences, living

DynCorp Sued by Holder Over $1.5 Billion Cerberus Bid 
DynCorp International Inc., the defense contractor that has
helped train Iraqi police, was sued by a stockholder claiming
his shares are undervalued in a $1.5 billion takeover bid by
Cerberus Capital Management LP. 
DynCorp, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said in a
statement on April 12 it would be bought by the New York-based
investment fund for $17.55 a share in cash -- a 49 percent
premium at the time. 
&#8220;The proposed transaction is unfair and grossly
inadequate&#8221; and &#8220;Cerberus may be taking advantage of a
temporarily depressed stock price,&#8221; shareholder Shawn K. Naito
said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed April 16.
Lawyers for Naito ask a judge to stop the deal and award damages
and legal fees. 
Craig R. Reed, a DynCorp senior vice president, didn&#8217;t

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Merrill Used Same Alleged Fraud as Goldman, Bank Says 
Merrill Lynch  Co. engaged in the same investor fraud that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. of committing, according to a bank that sued
the firm in New York last year. 
Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, known
as Rabobank, claims Merrill, now a unit of Bank of America
Corp., failed to tell it a key fact in advising on a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation. Omitted was Merrill&#8217;s
relationship with another client betting against the investment,
which resulted in a loss of $45 million, Rabobank claims. 
Merrill&#8217;s handling of the CDO, a security tied to the
performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities,
allegedly mirrored Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct that the SEC detailed
in a civil complaint filed April 16. The SEC claims Goldman
omitted the same key fact about a financial product tied to
subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was starting to
falter. 
&#8220;This is the tip of the iceberg in regard to Goldman Sachs
and certain other banks who were stacking the deck against CDO
investors,&#8221; said Jon Pickhardt, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, who is representing Netherlands-based
Rabobank. 
&#8220;The two matters are unrelated and the claims today are
not only unfounded but weren&#8217;t included in the Rabobank lawsuit
filed nearly a year ago,&#8221; Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman,
said April 16 of the Dutch bank&#8217;s claims. 
Kenneth Lench, head of the SEC&#8217;s Structured and New
Products unit, said that the agency &#8220;continues to investigate
the practices of investment banks and others involved in the
securitization of complex financial products tied to the U.S.
housing market as it was beginning to show signs of distress.&#8221; 
In its complaint, the SEC said New York-based Goldman
Sachs, which had a record $13.4 billion profit last year, failed
to disclose to investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was
betting against the CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the
selection of securities for the portfolio. Paulson, which
oversees $32 billion and didn&#8217;t market the CDO, wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
The SEC allegations are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact, and we
will vigorously contest them,&#8221; Goldman said in a statement. 
SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on whether it
is investigating Merrill&#8217;s actions. 
The case is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
BA v. Merrill Lynch  Co, 09-601832, New York State Supreme
Court (New York County).

Rajaratnam Sought Tips on Berkshire&#8217;s Goldman Buys, U.S. Says 
Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, who faces federal
insider trading charges, sought to acquire secret information
about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008 purchase of preferred
shares in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., federal prosecutors said in
a court filing. 
A letter from federal prosecutors to Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers
detailing new allegations of insider trading was made public
April 16 in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. In it,
prosecutors elaborated on an earlier claim that Rajaratnam tried
to use confidential information to trade on Goldman Sachs stock. 
Rajaratnam &#8220;conspired to obtain material, nonpublic
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman Sachs&#8221;
before its public announcement of earnings in June 2008 and
December 2008, according to the letter. &#8220;In addition,
Rajaratnam conspired to obtain material, nonpublic information
about the purchase by Berkshire Hathaway of preferred stock in
Goldman prior to Goldman&#8217;s public announcement&#8221; on Sept. 3,
2008, prosecutors said. 
Lawyers for Rajaratnam are asking a judge to exclude
evidence of additional allegations of insider trading, saying
prosecutors waited too long to disclose it. 
The filing doesn&#8217;t identify Rajaratnam&#8217;s source for
information about Goldman Sachs. It does provide details about
other alleged efforts to obtain inside information. 
&#8220;The allegation is false,&#8221; said Jim McCarthy, a spokesman
for Rajaratnam. 
Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is the central figure
in a probe in which 21 people have been charged criminally. He
claimed prosecutors are &#8220;sandbagging the defense&#8221; in violation
of his constitutional rights, including the right to defend
himself at trial. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Bank Class-Actions Bid in U.K. Not Dead, BBA Says 
U.K. consumers are likely to get another chance to file
class-action lawsuits against banks after a clause allowing such
cases was dropped from legislation written to respond to the
financial crisis. 
The provision will probably be taken up by a new government
following the May 6 general election, according to Eric
Leenders, a director at the London-based British Bankers&#8217;
Association, which didn&#8217;t object to the bill. 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t going away,&#8221; Leenders said in a phone
interview April 16. &#8220;Whichever party comes into power will be
looking at some kind of collective proceedings. We have another
opportunity to think about how they could be constructed.&#8221; 
The Financial Services Bill became law on April 8, after a
clause allowing groups to sue financial services firms was
abandoned when lawmakers ran out of time to debate it before
parliament was dissolved ahead of the election. 
The clause was considered amid increasing complaints about
bank fees, which U.K. antitrust regulators were barred from
examining for fairness. The language would have allowed lead
plaintiffs in a case to file claims on behalf of unspecified
customers who would have then needed to opt out of the case. 
Rachael Mulheron, a Queen Mary University of London law
professor who helped draft court rules for the dropped
provision, also said the class-action law has a chance with the
new government.

Verdicts/Settlements 
U.K. Tobacco Makers and Retailers Fined $346 Million 
 Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Gallaher Group Ltd. and 10
retailers were fined 225 million pounds ($346 million) for
coordinating cigarette prices between 2001 and 2003, a U.K.
antitrust regulator said. 
Imperial, the maker of the West, Davidoff and JPS brands,
received the largest penalty of 112.3 million pounds, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trade said April 16 in a statement. Gallaher, a
unit of Japan Tobacco Inc., was fined 50.4 million pounds. The
fine is the largest of its kind by the regulator. 
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.&#8217;s Asda unit was fined 14.2 million
pounds and The Co-operative Group was fined 14.1 million pounds
for their roles in a price-fixing scheme that the OFT says
barred retailers from setting their own prices. The affected
markets are worth about 13 billion pounds, the regulator said. 
The OFT said it dropped allegations made in 2008 about the
relationship between the tobacco companies and Tesco Plc,
because it didn&#8217;t have enough evidence. The regulator also said
it abandoned claims relating to indirect exchanges of proposed
future retail prices. 
Imperial denied breaking any laws and said in a statement
it would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. Japan
Tobacco views the fine as a &#8220;positive&#8221; development since the
fine has been formally decided, spokeswoman Yuka Sugimoto said. 
William Morrison Supermarkets Plc said it would challenge
the fines, saying the OFT&#8217;s stance was &#8220;illogical and without
foundation.&#8221; Morrison was fined 2.45 million pounds and Safeway
stores, which it acquired, were fined 10.9 million pounds. 
 J Sainsbury Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest supermarket
owner, alerted the OFT to the price-fixing arrangement and was
the first to apply to the watchdog for leniency. The company
received full immunity from fines. 
Imperial hasn&#8217;t taken any provisions for the fine, and
&#8220;any appeal to the tribunal will lead to the suspension of the
fine,&#8221; Imperial Tobacco spokesman Simon Evans said April 16 in
a phone interview. 
Gallaher, Asda, First Quench, One Stop, Somerfield and TM
Retail were given reductions to their fines because they
admitted liability when they received the OFT&#8217;s so-called
statement of objections in April 2008.

Dewey  LeBoeuf Issues Bonds as Law Firms Search for Capital 
Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP said it raised money in a bond
offering, a rare action by a U.S. law firm. The New York-based
firm sold about $125 million in an offering, according to two
people familiar with the transaction. 
The 1,200-attorney firm used the private placement to
refinance existing bank debt, partner Richard Shutran said. He
declined to disclose the interest rate for the bonds, saying it
was more favorable than the firm&#8217;s bank loans.

Court News 
Oboe-Playing Judicial Artist Diane Wood Eyed for High Court 
Diane Wood and her colleagues on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago have philosophical differences. That
didn&#8217;t stop Judge Richard Posner, the court&#8217;s most outspoken
conservative, from officiating at her wedding when she married
for the third time in 2006. 
Wood has demonstrated a willingness to challenge her fellow
jurists without offending, say lawyers and clerks who have
observed her in court. Those attributes may be an asset as
President Barack Obama considers her to replace retiring Justice
John Paul Stevens on an often-divided U.S. Supreme Court. 
In 1995, Wood persuaded Posner and other jurists to rethink
the case of an Indiana inmate fighting his death sentence when
she asked whether anyone warned him about repeated federal
challenges. &#8220;Silence can mislead,&#8221; Posner later wrote,
reversing an earlier opinion joined by fellow judge Frank
Easterbrook. 
&#8220;That was an example of the art of judging,&#8221; said Tom
Brown, a former clerk for Wood who is a San Francisco lawyer.
&#8220;She asked the question in a way not to embarrass Judge
Easterbrook.&#8221; 
While Wood&#8217;s opinions supported abortion rights and
separation of church and state, her rulings on business matters
aren&#8217;t easy to pigeonhole. 
A 2000 decision favored Ameritech Corp. in a lawsuit filed
by consumers. Just days later, she upheld a Federal Trade
Commission finding that Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us Inc. improperly tried to use
its market power to keep the most popular toys out of warehouse-
style discount stores. 
&#8220;She may lean toward the liberal side on social issues,&#8221;
said Jeffrey Sarles, a partner at Chicago-based Mayer Brown LLP
who appeared before Wood on her first day on the bench. &#8220;On
business issues, she doesn&#8217;t seem ideological.&#8221; 
Wood, 59, who plays oboe in the Chicago Bar Association
Symphony Orchestra, said through her staff that she isn&#8217;t
commenting on her reported candidacy.

Court Filings 
Tribune Bankruptcy Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg System 
The bankruptcy docket of the Tribune Co. was the most-read
litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. 
Tribune filed bankruptcy in December 2008, one year after
real estate billionaire Sam Zell used more than $8 billion in
loans to take control of the publishing and television company.
The company&#8217;s newspapers include the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. 
Last week, Tribune filed a reorganization plan that would
reduce debt taken on during a 2007 buyout in exchange for giving
its lenders 91 percent of the bankrupt publisher. The plan,
filed April 12, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, reflects
the settlement Tribune reached with its main creditors. 
To read more about the reorganization plan, click here. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s stock
may drop and the board could come under pressure to change
managers after European politicians followed a U.S. fraud suit
with their own plans to scrutinize the firm, investors said. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority to start a probe, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Goldman Sachs.
Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details
on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. 
The escalating rhetoric adds urgency to efforts by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of his
board to stem the negative publicity. Although Goldman Sachs
vowed to fight the SEC case, calling it &#8220;unfounded in law and
fact,&#8221; the stock fell 13 percent on April 16. The shares rose
0.6 percent to $162.42 in European trading today. 
&#8220;The lynch-mob mentality that is prevailing right now
against Goldman is such that you don&#8217;t know where this thing
could go, so I think the stock is going to be under continuing
pressure,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4
billion as chairman of New York-based Holland  Co. &#8220;The board
actually has to pay attention not only to the legal niceties of
this thing but also to the franchise viability as well.&#8221; 
Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, said he sold his Goldman Sachs
stock on April 16 because the SEC suit brought the controversy
over Wall Street&#8217;s dealings in collateralized debt obligations
and credit-default swaps to a new level. 
&#8216;Investors Understand Fraud&#8217; 
&#8220;Investors understand that something complicated and
errant happened with CDOs and CDSs but they&#8217;re not sure entirely
what, because these collateralized debt obligations and credit-
default swaps are complicated and somewhat arcane,&#8221; said Farr,
whose firm manages more than $700 million in assets. &#8220;But
investors understand fraud, they get fraud really clearly.&#8221;
Samuel Robinson, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. 
Goldman Sachs, whose $13.4 billion profit last year was the
highest ever for a Wall Street securities firm, is facing an
unprecedented level of public opprobrium because of the
perception that it profited from practices that led to the
biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at the Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as
other financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously
very worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it
could well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; 
&#8216;The Bogey Man&#8217; 
Politicians that were forced to bail out their nations&#8217;
banks are turning on Goldman Sachs. The firm, which paid its
employees $16.2 billion last year, has become a target for
politicians like the U.K.&#8217;s Brown who are running in elections
or who, in the U.S., are battling over new financial regulation. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs will now become the bogey man for all
financial ills and I think it&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s not going away,
it is only likely to increase,&#8221; said Matt McCormick, an analyst
at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8
billion. &#8220;If you buy it at these levels you are hoping that
this is the worst of the bad news and I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the
case.&#8221; 
The European Union is probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in
arranging swaps for Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s
budget deficit. Congress has also examined the company&#8217;s
relationship with American International Group Inc., which got a
$182.3 billion U.S. rescue. 
Federal Case Assigned 
The SEC case against Goldman Sachs was assigned to U.S.
District Judge Barbara Jones in New York who presided over the
case of former WorldCom Inc. CEO Bernard Ebbers. Ebbers, who was
convicted in 2005 of overseeing one of the biggest frauds in
U.S. history, is serving a 25-year prison term. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter profit, due out tomorrow,
probably won&#8217;t help even though analysts expect earnings to rise
41 percent from a year earlier, McCormick said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to probably come out with great earnings,
at least that&#8217;s the expectation, but that is going to be quickly
discounted and drowned out,&#8221; he said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board of directors should do its own
investigation to ensure that it understands what senior
management knew about the issues raised by the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
said James Post, a professor of corporate governance and ethics
at the Boston University School of Management. 
&#8216;How Long?&#8217; 
&#8220;The board has got to be insisting on a much deeper level
of internal investigation that reports only to them, not to
Blankfein,&#8221; Post. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got to be asking the question &#8216;how
long can we continue going with Blankfein before we&#8217;ve got to
clean house and put a new group of people in there?&#8221; 
William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor who
has served on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board since 2002, referred a
request for an interview to the company&#8217;s press office. His
Twitter account, which lauded JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie
Dimon for his firm&#8217;s better-than-expected earnings on April 14,
remained silent on the controversy surrounding Goldman Sachs. 
Boston University&#8217;s Post said he wouldn&#8217;t expect the board
to take any immediate action to change the firm&#8217;s management
because it would seem to contradict the defiant position the
company took on April 16. 
&#8216;A Bad Weekend&#8217; 
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that the board at Goldman is having a bad
weekend,&#8221; Post said on April 18. &#8220;They may be praying for some
news out of the Vatican or a new volcano to get them off the
front pages.&#8221; 
Bahl  Gaynor&#8217;s McCormick said changing senior management
could add fuel to critics&#8217; complaints instead of mollifying
them. A better course, he said, would be to bring in a well-
respected Wall Street veteran, even someone like billionaire
Warren Buffett, to serve as a chairman or adviser to Blankfein.
Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is already one of the largest
investors in Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;I could see them bringing in an outside person, somebody
who is viewed by the Street as a wise sage that could come in
and give an outsider&#8217;s perspective&#8221; to advise Blankfein,
McCormick said. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to believe Goldman is going to
take care of this on their own.&#8221;

Widening probes of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may prompt a drop of as much as 10 percent in global
stock markets, according to AMP Capital Investors Ltd., a unit
of Australia&#8217;s biggest provider of pension plans. 
The MSCI World Index, as well as U.S. and Asian equity
gauges, are ripe for a &#8220;multi-month&#8221; correction after
valuations soared, said Nader Naeimi, a strategist who helps
oversee $90 billion for the Sydney-based mutual-funds manager.
AMP Capital last week began moving to cash assets from equities,
anticipating a decline in stocks, Naeimi said. The MSCI World,
which measures 23 developed markets, has rallied 43 percent in
the past 12 months. 
&#8220;The Goldman inquiries have triggered a fresh wave of
anxiety for investors,&#8221; Naeimi said in an interview today.
&#8220;Not only is the market worried who might be next, it&#8217;s
anticipating tighter regulation of the banking sector. Given how
over-bought stocks had become, this may be enough to trigger the
sharp correction in the overall market that we&#8217;ve been
expecting.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most-profitable Wall Street firm in
history, faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from
the German government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued the firm for alleged fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. 
Financial Stocks 
The MSCI World Index&#8217;s rally in the past 12 months has
driven the average valuation for companies in the gauge to 14.8
times estimated earnings, compared with 11.2 times at the
gauge&#8217;s March 9, 2009 low. The measure dropped 0.6 percent as
of 4:57 p.m. in Tokyo, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank
1.9 percent. 
Any correction is likely to hurt financial stocks in
particular, and could last for as long as six months, at which
point shares in Asian banks, which are generally less leveraged
than their U.S. and European counterparts, will look especially
attractive, AMP Capital&#8217;s Naeimi said. 
&#8220;Whenever the global financial sector is hit, there tends
to be guilt by association,&#8221; said Naeimi. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at
buying into Asian financials when we think the correction is
close to having run its course. Depending on relative valuations
at the time, you might well see us rotating out of developed-
world financial stocks into Asian ones.&#8221; 
U.K. Probe 
The strategist told a Bloomberg Television on April 14,
2009 that the &#8220;bear market&#8221; in global equities had ended. The
MSCI World Index finished the year with a 27 percent advance.
Naeimi also called a &#8220;correction&#8221; for the U.S. Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index on Oct. 16, 2009. The gauge dropped 5.6 percent
between Oct. 19 and Oct. 30. 
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry into Goldman,
saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated
in the suit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC
for details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela
Merkel said. 
Politicians who were forced to bail out their banks during
the financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. 
&#8220;The timing of the accusations against Goldman was perfect
for investors seeking to sell shares, since markets worldwide
had been overheating,&#8221; said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a strategist in
Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $66 billion.

A fraud suit by U.S. regulators
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is unlikely to send hedge funds
scrambling to reduce gold holdings, according to Superfund
Financial Singapore Pte. 
Any retreat in prices will present investors, especially
central banks, with a buying opportunity, Aaron Smith, managing
director of Superfund, said in an interview today. Gold for
immediate delivery was little changed at $1,136.57 an ounce at
11:57 a.m. in Singapore after slumping by the most in more than
two months on April 16. 
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t expect hedge funds to unwind their
positions,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Even if they do, I think central
banks, especially in the East, whether it&#8217;s India or China or
any central bank that is smart, will use it as an opportunity to
acquire gold at a cheaper level.&#8221; 
Goldman faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny
from the German government after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. The firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
instruments and influenced the selections in the portfolio, the
SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
As of Dec. 31, Paulson was the largest holder in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund back by the metal,
and Goldman was the 11th biggest. Both are based in New York.
Paulson is also the top investor in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.,
Africa&#8217;s largest producer of bullion. 
&#8216;Good Opportunity&#8217; 
Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions in New York gold futures in the week
ended April 13, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. 
Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 220,742 contracts on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-
long positions rose by 17,296 contracts, or 9 percent, from a
week earlier. 
&#8220;In the short term, there&#8217;s a possibility of a pullback
and we would recommend to any investor that&#8217;s a good
opportunity&#8221; to enter the market, Smith said. &#8220;In the long run,
the hard assets will have sustainable value and sustainable
purchasing power.&#8221; 
Gold rallied 24 percent last year as central banks and
governments maintained low interest rates and spent trillions of
dollars to stimulate economies, sending the dollar 4.2 percent
lower against six major currencies. Bullion has gained 3.6
percent this year. 
&#8220;If the upward trend in equity markets continues and
interest rates continue to stay low, we won&#8217;t certainly see a
large pullback in commodity markets,&#8221; Smith said. 
Central banks in Russia, China, India, Sri Lanka and
Mauritius have all increased their gold reserves. China has
expanded reserves by 76 percent to 1,054 metric tons since 2003,
the central bank said last year. India bought 200 tons from the
International Monetary Fund last year as gold prices soared and
the dollar weakened.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused
by regulators last week of fraud in its mortgage-securities
business, may show investors tomorrow whether its dominance of
Wall Street&#8217;s debt trading is being eroded by competitors. 
Analysts including Howard Chen at Credit Suisse Group AG
expect New York-based Goldman Sachs, which reports first-quarter
earnings tomorrow, to say revenue from fixed-income trading
dropped from $6.56 billion in last year&#8217;s first quarter.
Earnings last week from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co., the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, surged on record
first-quarter revenue from the business. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, relied on fixed-income trading for more than
half of revenue last year, helping the firm post record profit.
Competitors that lagged behind Goldman Sachs a year ago are
trying to catch up. Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on
April 21, hired more than 350 people last year to rebuild its
sales and trading business. 
&#8220;Competition appears to be returning, but it&#8217;s not
necessarily a zero-sum game as the overall market is growing,&#8221;
said New York-based Chen, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Global GDP is positive,
fixed-income issuance levels have been robust and client
liquidity levels seem healthy.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s competitors may see the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit against the firm as an opportunity to
grab market share. The SEC sued the firm for fraud on April 16,
saying Goldman Sachs misled investors in its marketing of
collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages.
Goldman Sachs said the allegations were &#8220;completely unfounded in
law and fact.&#8221; 
Dimon&#8217;s Outlook 
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts last week that he
didn&#8217;t expect his bank to be alone in reporting gains in trading
revenue because overall demand from clients has picked up. 
&#8220;It is a lot of client flow, so we&#8217;re not the only ones
who saw that,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to see other
people report similarly good numbers driven by client flow.&#8221; 
Of the six-biggest U.S. banks by assets, only Goldman Sachs
and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. are expected by
analysts to show a decline in profit in 2010 compared with last
year, when they both generated record earnings. 
First-quarter adjusted earnings at Goldman Sachs will
probably rise 54 percent from a year earlier to $2.55 billion,
or $4.14 per share, according to the average estimate of 23
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Gorman&#8217;s Goal 
James Gorman, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s new CEO, is expected to
report $1.1 billion in adjusted first-quarter earnings, or 57
cents a share, compared with a loss a year earlier, a Bloomberg
survey shows. Credit Suisse&#8217;s Chen expects Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
fixed-income trading revenue to rise to $1.95 billion from last
year&#8217;s $1.29 billion, which was damped by writedowns and
accounting adjustments related to the firm&#8217;s credit costs. 
&#8220;You listen to James Gorman on the call last quarter and
he&#8217;s very clear that we want to be top three in all of our
businesses,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;That would mean closing the gap in
fixed-income and equities trading.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment
about trading revenue. Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag
also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs gained 4.7 percentage points of market share
in fixed-income trading since the first half of 2007, more than
double the next-biggest climb of any of the top 14 banks, Keith
Horowitz, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an April 6 note
to investors. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s market share in fixed-income
trading fell 2.4 percentage points in that time, Horowitz said. 
&#8220;Ability to regain trading market share is the key to the
stock,&#8221; Horowitz wrote of Morgan Stanley. 
Analysts&#8217; Estimates 
Goldman Sachs will probably report $6.09 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue in the first quarter, down 7 percent from
a year earlier, Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman said in a
March 30 note. Morgan Stanley may report $1.94 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue, up 50 percent, Freeman said. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s first-quarter earnings surpassed estimates last
week in part because of $5.5 billion in fixed-income revenue
that set a record for the New York-based bank. Bank of America
said April 16 that revenue from fixed-income, currency and
commodity trading climbed 16 percent to $5.52 billion in the
first quarter, the most since the largest U.S. bank acquired
Merrill Lynch last year. 
UBS AG generated about $2.3 billion of revenue at its
fixed-income division in the first quarter, people with
knowledge of the situation said last month. The bank said that
figure was &#8220;slightly higher&#8221; than its forecast. Writedowns in
the first quarter of 2009 forced the Zurich-based company to
report negative revenue of 1.97 billion Swiss francs ($1.86
billion) for the period. 
&#8216;Normal Level&#8217; 
&#8220;Revenues you&#8217;re seeing now are probably more broadly
based,&#8221; said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities LLP. &#8220;Bid-offer spreads have come down to a more normal
level, but you&#8217;ve seen a pickup in client activity across a
number of different sectors, so I think we&#8217;re getting more
toward a normal environment.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs generated $23.3 billion in revenue from sales
and trading in fixed-income, currencies and commodities, more
than half of the firm&#8217;s total revenue last year. That
performance helped drive the firm to the largest profit in Wall
Street history just one year after reporting its first quarterly
loss as a public company. 
Morgan Stanley generated $5.02 billion of fixed-income
sales and trading revenue as it ramped up risk at a slower pace
than Goldman. The firm replaced its sales and trading chief,
Mitch Petrick, and its head of interest-rate trading, Roberto
Hoornweg, and has been hiring to revive the business. 
Debt Spreads 
Charges related to the firm&#8217;s debt spreads that reduced
fixed-income trading revenue by $3.3 billion in 2009 &#8220;are
largely behind&#8221; it, Gorman said this month in a letter to
shareholders. 
Still, 12 analysts have cut their estimate for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s first-quarter earnings in the past four weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average adjusted
earnings per-share estimate fell 13.8 cents in that period, the
data show. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is trying to become more diversified by
expanding its retail brokerage, but trading revenues remain the
key factor driving their results,&#8221; Staite said. 
Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 4.8 percent this year,
including a 13 percent decline on April 16 when the fraud
allegations were announced. Morgan Stanley has dropped 1.5
percent in 2010, after gaining gained 85 percent last year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
U.S. fraud case against the firm hinges on the actions of the
employee it placed on paid leave this week. 
Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about a
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will also be de-registered
from the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm
in London said yesterday. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; 
By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publically distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. 
Goldman Sachs may also want to separate itself from Tourre
if it&#8217;s concerned he will cooperate with the SEC or implicate
more senior employees, said Onnig Dombalagian, a professor at
Tulane University Law School in New Orleans and former attorney
fellow at the SEC.

Bank shares in countries such as
China and India, which have outperformed global rivals by about
30 percentage points since the &#8220;Lehman shock,&#8221; may extend
their advantage amid fraud probes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
The CHART OF THE DAY shows MSCI&#8217;s financials indexes for
emerging-markets in Asia and worldwide starting from Sept. 15,
2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
The bottom panel compares the gauges&#8217; weighted estimated
earnings, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman was sued
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16.
Asia&#8217;s emerging markets as defined by Morgan Stanley for its
indexes include China, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
&#8220;Asian emerging-market financial stocks will continue to
outperform,&#8221; said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees
$11 billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot less volcanic eruption in Asian
financials compared with Western financials, which face
increasing regulation and sovereign-debt issues.&#8221; 
The financial crisis in 1997 caused Asian banks to be
&#8220;more prudent,&#8221; allowing them to strengthen balance sheets,
said Do. That crisis, triggered by plunging currencies, forced
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea to seek International
Monetary Fund aid. Asia&#8217;s emerging-market countries have about
$3.7 trillion in reserves, almost half the global total. 
&#8220;Asian banks in general have more healthy balance sheets,
and their loan growth so far has been recovering quite well
versus still-negative loan growth in U.S. and European banks,&#8221;
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based vice president of investment
services at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which manages about
$102 billion in Asia-Pacific assets. 
The SEC suit against Goldman linked to collateralized debt
obligations may also trigger stricter scrutiny from European
regulators. The U.K. Financial Services Authority said it will
investigate Goldman Sachs International. The European Union is
also probing the bank&#8217;s role in arranging credit swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit.

U.S. Senate candidate Alexi
Giannoulias pushed his Republican opponent in Illinois to give
back donations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. without saying
whether President Barack Obama should return almost $1 million
that bank employees contributed to his White House bid. 
Obama, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Mark Kirk, the congressman competing against Giannoulias
for the seat once held by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from
Goldman employees, the center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are
Democratic Congressman Michael McMahon of New York, Republican
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, and three other New York
Democrats: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Representative Scott
Murphy and Senator Charles Schumer. 
&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement.

Allegations that Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. deceived its customers have done little to hurt Wall
Street&#8217;s stock recommendation, the most bullish since 2005. 
Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. reiterated &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-based
company since April 16, when the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a fraud suit that has sent the shares down 11
percent. Twenty-two firms advise that clients purchase Goldman
Sachs, which today reported first-quarter profit excluding some
items that beat the average analyst estimate by 35 percent. One,
Oppenheimer  Co., downgraded the stock since the claims were
announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Analysts are speculating Goldman Sachs will preserve its
reputation and benefit from an expanding economy that helped
lift its shares 208 percent since November 2008. The stock
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday after two people with knowledge of
the vote said the SEC split 3-2 along party lines to approve the
enforcement action, before falling 2.1 percent today. 
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sell any,&#8221; said Stephen Lieber, chief
investment officer of Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, which
manages more than $7 billion, including Goldman Sachs shares,
from Purchase, New York. &#8220;Do we have sufficient information to
provide an overall take at this point? No. The underlying
business of Goldman Sachs remains a suitable investment.&#8221;

Illinois, New Jersey and Texas are
among municipal-bond issuers sticking with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to underwrite pending debt sales after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission charged the firm with fraud. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re innocent until proven guilty,&#8221; said James Fuller,
chief financial officer of Georgia&#8217;s Municipal Electric
Authority in Atlanta, which borrowed $2.5 billion in early March
using banks led by Goldman. &#8220;People have to have their day in
court.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was the fifth-largest senior underwriter of
municipal debt last year, handling about $34 billion, according
to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. It was accused by the SEC
on April 16 of creating and selling collateralized debt
obligations tied to subprime mortgages in 2007 without
disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities. It also didn&#8217;t say that Paulson bet
against the securities, the SEC said. 
Goldman will remain a co-senior manager on an $851 million
fixed-rate issue for New Jersey&#8217;s Economic Development Authority
scheduled for as soon as this week, said Andrew Pratt, a
spokesman in Trenton, New Jersey, for Treasurer Andrew Eristoff,
a Republican. Goldman is co-senior manager with New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch  Co. will manage the sale. 
&#8220;Until it actually is fined or loses its lawsuit, it would
be very, very premature to eliminate them from a bond
transaction,&#8221; Pratt said in a telephone interview. 
Illinois Sale Coming 
Illinois plans to keep Goldman as an underwriter for coming
bond sales, John Sinsheimer, director of capital markets, said
in an interview from Chicago. So will the North Texas Tollway
Authority on a deal coming in May, Sherita Coffelt, a
spokeswoman based in Plano, Texas, said in an e-mail. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. The firm said in
a statement that the SEC&#8217;s allegations were &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs today reiterated its denial that it misled
investors and reported that net income rose 91 percent in the
first quarter to $3.46 billion, beating analyst estimates. The
shares slid $3.34, or 2.1 percent, to $159.98 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have declined 5.2
percent since Dec. 31. 
Georgia&#8217;s Fuller was among officials saying they would take
a closer look at Goldman Sachs if it were to lose the SEC case
or be found to have committed wrongdoing. 
&#8216;Unacceptable&#8217; 
If the allegations &#8220;are substantiated, they&#8217;re
unacceptable,&#8221; and could prompt the state to review its
relationship with the firm, said Washington State Treasurer
James McIntire. Goldman was lead underwriter on $503.4 million
of Build America Bonds for the state in October. 
&#8220;We have concerns about the lawsuit,&#8221; McIntire, a
Democrat, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Transparency is an
important issue. It affects the whole marketplace. We expect our
underwriter to be a partner, not an adversary.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, has made $55.7 million of fees from $36.4
billion of Build America Bonds sales, about a third of what it
earned from its municipal business, the company said in a March
1 response to queries from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an
Iowa Republican. 
Connecticut Review 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office has begun a preliminary review for a possible state
investigation of Goldman related to the SEC&#8217;s action. 
&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s allegations read like a Sopranos episode,&#8221;
Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in an April 16 statement, referring
to a crime family at the center of a U.S. television series. 
California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, a Democrat, is also
looking into whether Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street
underwriters promoted derivative trades to clients that would
have enabled them to bet against the state. The state is
reviewing the responses to questions sent to the firm last
month, said spokesman Tom Dresslar, based in Sacramento. He
declined say what steps California may take. 
&#8220;We have questions about how Goldman Sachs and other big
banks have been treating their clients -- the taxpayers of the
state of California,&#8221; said Dresslar. &#8220;The basic question is:
The taxpayers of this state are paying you guys hundreds of
millions of dollars to sell their bonds; to what extent are you
either betting against those bonds or facilitating bets against
those bonds?&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. fell the most since February in New York trading after
reporting a drop in service signings, signaling corporate
spending on larger technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
total sales, fell about 2 percent to $12.3 billion in the first
quarter, IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
said yesterday. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. 
IBM still hasn&#8217;t signaled to shareholders that profit can
rise based on sales growth rather than steps like costs cutting
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. Investors are seeking faster
revenue growth as the economy begins to recover, he said. 
&#8220;IBM is simply not that attractive of a growth story right
now,&#8221; said Marshall, who rates the shares &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own them. &#8220;Really good financial management from an
earnings perspective. At the end of the day, not much from a
revenue perspective.&#8221; 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said in
its earnings statement. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $2.54, or 1.9 percent,
to $129.69 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, its steepest drop since Feb. 4. It is little changed
this year, compared with an 8.3 percent advance in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Corporate Spending 
Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler,
who recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; 
Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. 
IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
risen 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. 
Second-Quarter Outlook 
Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. 
IBM said profit this year will be at least $11.20 a share,
up from a previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts
predicted $11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, spent the past decade
selling off hardware businesses and investing in its higher-
margin software and services units, which now make up more than
80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross profit
margins, the percentage of sales left after production costs,
for 10 quarters on a year-over-year basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported that net income
almost doubled in the first quarter and said it didn&#8217;t mislead
investors. 
&#8220;This all seems to be at root about whether someone
intentionally misled someone, and that&#8217;s not something we would
approve of or sanction,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Co-General Counsel Greg
Palm told analysts on a conference call today. He spoke after
the firm said earnings jumped 91 percent to $3.46 billion, or
$5.59 a share, surpassing analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, is fending off regulatory claims while cementing its
position as the most profitable investment bank in Wall Street
history. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm
of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, helped select the underlying assets. 
Goldman Sachs had &#8220;no incentive&#8221; for the deal to fail,
and lost more than $100 million on the transaction, Palm said.
The firm was &#8220;somewhat surprised&#8221; when the SEC filed its suit
on April 16, as &#8220;no one had told us in advance,&#8221; he said. 
Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the suit today,
saying in a statement announcing earnings that &#8220;in light of
recent events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of
our clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment
of our people.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. failed to ensure proper
monitoring of patients and their side effects in a clinical
trial, U.S. regulators said today. 
The Food and Drug Administration posted a warning letter on
its Web site today outlining &#8220;significant violations&#8221;
discovered during an inspection of a Pfizer clinical trial site
from May 4 to June 3. The letter, dated April 9, was redacted to
remove the name of the medicine and the study. Pfizer
spokeswoman Kristen Neese said the study involved tests of the
company&#8217;s bipolar disorder treatment Geodon for use in children. 
While Pfizer was warned by the agency in 2005 over lack of
study monitoring that led to widespread overdoses, follow-up
inspections in 2006 and 2007 also found dosing errors, the FDA
said in the documents. The agency ordered the New York-based
drugmaker to respond within 15 days with a plan to ensure that
its studies comply with federal regulations. 
&#8220;Pfizer has communicated with the FDA about our conduct of
clinical trials and, over the next two weeks, will provide an
outline of new and existing processes for preventing similar
issues with Pfizer clinical trials in the future,&#8221; Neese said
in an e-mail today. 
Pfizer fell 3 cents to $16.76 at 4:05 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 7.9
percent this year. 
Geodon&#8217;s Heart Impact 
Geodon prolongs the heart&#8217;s electrical cycle. Short-term
studies suggest children are sensitive to these changes in the
heart and may be more susceptible to potentially deadly
arrhythmias, according to an FDA staff review. Outside advisers
to the agency backed pediatric use in June, with most members
calling for more testing to evaluate the risks. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s Abilify and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s
Risperdal, now generic, were cleared for pediatric use in 2007.
Doctors treating children sometimes prescribe other
antipsychotics that aren&#8217;t approved for pediatric use. 
Children ages 7 to 17 accounted for 11 percent of Geodon
use in 2008, according to data posted on the FDA&#8217;s Web site
before the advisory panel meeting. While doctors are free to
prescribe the drug for this unapproved use, Pfizer isn&#8217;t
permitted by the FDA to promote the medicine to treat children. 
Geodon is approved for adults with schizophrenia and manic
episodes of bipolar disorder.

Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent,
bolstered by sales in Latin America. 
Net income increased to $1.61 billion, or 69 cents share,
in the quarter ended April 2 from $1.35 billion, or 58 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. 
Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.53 billion, the company said.
Eight analysts predicted $7.72 billion, on average. Global sales
by drink volume grew 3 percent, helped by a 4 percent increase
in Latin America. Sales by drink volume in North America
declined 2 percent. 
Coca-Cola is seeking to boost revenue and volume as
consumers recover from a global recession. Sales have bounced
back faster in emerging markets than in larger markets including
the U.S., Coca-Cola said.

Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 8.3 percent. PepsiCo plans to announce
first-quarter earnings April 22. 
Earnings excluding some items totaled 80 cents a share,
Coca-Cola said. Analysts predicted 74 cents, the average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
The company also named Steve Cahillane, president of Coca-
Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North America unit, to run a new
bottling and foodservice division when it combines with Coca-

Cahillane, who joined Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2007, will
become president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola expects to complete the purchase of CCE in the

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
is among at least three companies being investigated as part of
a U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe of bidding at
municipal tax-lien auctions in New Jersey. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Xspand unit and Vienna, Virginia-based Mooring
Tax Asset Group received grand jury subpoenas last year,
according to an August prospectus for New York City tax-lien
bonds that are serviced by the firms. Two units of Royal Bank
America were subpoenaed, its parent, Royal Bancshares of
Pennsylvania Inc. said in a March 2009 regulatory filing. 
New Jersey municipalities auction about $100 million a year
in tax debts on commercial and residential property to
investors, said Vincent Belluscio, executive director of the
state tax collectors and treasurers association. Antitrust
officials are probing whether investors colluded to limit
competition on sales to win a higher return, he said. In New
Jersey, the liens can carry annual interest of as much as 18
percent. The auctions are designed so that investors bid down
the interest rate they&#8217;re willing to accept. 
&#8220;The problem is these investors have a tendency to meet in
the hallway before a sale and divvy up the list,&#8221; Belluscio
said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;We&#8217;ll buy these properties, and you buy
those.&#8217; And the interest rate holds at 18 percent.&#8221; 
Belluscio said his information comes from a tax collector
who was visited by a federal investigator. 
Lien Buyers 
Cities and towns in New Jersey and 27 other states sell tax
debts to investors to raise cash and help plug budget deficits.
Some of the debts are packaged into bonds and sold. Tax-lien
buyers also get the right to collect penalties imposed on
delinquent taxpayers by governments, and have first priority to
take possession of properties when the owners don&#8217;t pay their
taxes. 
About $5 billion of property-tax delinquencies are sold
each year, Xspand officials told the Unified Government
Commission of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas,
according to a transcript of the Nov. 25 meeting on the
municipality&#8217;s Web site. 
In Florida, $1.8 billion of the liens were sold last year,
making it the largest property-debt auction market in the U.S.,
according to Plantation, Florida-based RealAuction.com, which
conducts online tax sales in counties throughout the state. 
Expensive Cost 
&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s concerned,&#8221; said Adam D. Greenberg, managing
partner of law firm Honig  Greenberg in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, whose clients include tax-lien investors. &#8220;Even if
you&#8217;re innocent, just responding to an investigation is
expensive.&#8221; 
Greenberg said he knows of other investors who received
subpoenas, though he declined to identify them or say if they
are clients. 
Justin G. Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment, as did Mark Sanders, a spokesman for Narbeth,
Pennsylvania-based Royal Bank, whose Crusader Servicing Corp.
and Royal Tax Lien Services LLC units are subjects of the probe. 
&#8220;Anybody who is a significant buyer in New Jersey has been
subpoenaed,&#8221; said John M. Jacquemin, president and founder of
Mooring Financial Corp., which has managed and serviced more
than $1 billion in delinquent tax liens since starting Mooring
Tax Asset Group in 1997. &#8220;We certainly were not involved with
any collusion.&#8221; 
Training to Prevent 
Mooring for at least eight years has trained its bidders on
the company policy against anti-competitive behavior and
requires them to sign statements confirming that they understand
the expectations, he said. 
Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, declined to comment. 
Xspand, which was founded by former New Jersey Governor
James Florio in 2000, was acquired by Bear Stearns Cos. six
years later. Also known as Plymouth Park Tax Services, it became
part of JPMorgan when the New York-based bank took over Bear
Stearns in 2008 to prevent a collapse. 
Xspand, based in Whippany, New Jersey, effectively stopped
participating in open-outcry auctions about nine months ago, a
person familiar with the decision said. It had become the
largest tax-lien investor in the U.S., buying $2 billion of
public debt across the country since 2008, The New York Times
reported Aug. 18. 
The company continues to service tax liens and bid on them
in Internet auctions and bulk sales by municipalities, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because of the
investigation. 
Florio Unaware 
Florio, who sold his Xspand interest in 2006, said he
wasn&#8217;t aware of the Justice Department investigation. Tax-lien
sales were heated when he ran the company, he said in an April
16 telephone interview. 
&#8220;It was very, very competitive,&#8221; he said. 
Paul V. Scura, who founded Xspand with Florio and left when
Bear Stearns took it over, said Xspand employees got thorough
training on avoiding anticompetitive behavior. 
&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine any of the employees of Xspand doing that
given how they&#8217;ve been sensitized to the importance of this
issue,&#8221; Scura said in an April 19 telephone interview. 
Last June, Harvey M. Nusbaum and Jack W. Stollof were
indicted in federal court in Maryland for conspiring to rig tax-
lien bids at auctions in the state. Nusbaum and Stollof and
others &#8220;agreed among themselves which of them would bid on
specific tax liens or groups of tax liens, and agreed upon
specific prices to be bid in certain auctions,&#8221; according to a
June 16 statement by the Justice Department. 
Plea Agreement 
Nusbaum entered a plea agreement and Stollof pleaded guilty
early this year. 
&#8220;With so many homeowners struggling these days, it is more
important than ever that all aspects of real estate
transactions, including tax-lien auctions, remain competitive
and free from collusion,&#8221; Scott D. Hammond, deputy assistant
U.S. attorney general for criminal enforcement of the
department&#8217;s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement
last June.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is
facing a fraud suit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over its sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
tried to get rid of its portion of the deal, a lawyer for the
firm said. 
&#8220;I believe we did attempt to see if there was any other
interest on the other side of the transaction,&#8221; Greg Palm,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said today on a conference
call with reporters when asked if the New York-based firm had
tried to sell its stake in the &#8220;super-senior&#8221; debt. 
Goldman Sachs said it lost more than $100 million on the
Abacus 2007-AC1 collateralized debt obligation that is at the
center of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit, including $83 million related to
its piece of the super-senior debt. The regulator says the firm
failed to explain to buyers of the CDO that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet on the CDO failing, had helped select
the assets underlying the security. 
Earlier today, on a conference call with analysts, Palm
said the company&#8217;s decision to own some of the CDO showed it had
confidence in the deal. 
&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have taken on this risk if we believed there
was something wrong in this transaction, we wouldn&#8217;t have put
our skin in the game in that way,&#8221; Palm said. 
Also on today&#8217;s call with reporters, Palm said the firm and
its representatives haven&#8217;t had discussions with the Department
of Justice on the case involved in the SEC matter or on any
similar issues. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had no discussions with the DOJ,&#8221; Palm said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., being
sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims
that it deceived investors about one of its financial products,
tried to fend off regulators last fall by arguing it had a duty
to keep the information confidential. 
The company failed to disclose that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., run by billionaire John Paulson, helped pick the underlying
securities in a collateralized debt obligation and then bet
against them, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed April 16. After
being told in July 2009 that the SEC planned to bring a
complaint, New York-based Goldman Sachs argued it had been
compelled to keep Paulson&#8217;s role secret. 
The SEC&#8217;s &#8220;proposed theory ignores the fact that, as a
broker-dealer acting as an intermediary on behalf of a client,
Goldman Sachs had a duty to keep information concerning its
client&#8217;s (Paulson&#8217;s) trades, positions and trading strategy
confidential,&#8221; the company said in a Sept. 10, 2009, document
addressed to the agency. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable company in Wall Street
history, created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages in
2007, using ACA Management LLC, a firm that analyzes credit
risk, to select underlying securities. Goldman Sachs knew that
at least one prospective investor, Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t likely to invest in a CDO that
didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager to analyze and select the
portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. Goldman Sachs misled
investors by not disclosing that Paulson had a hand in picking
the portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported first-quarter
earnings that surpassed analysts&#8217; estimates on record fixed-
income trading revenue. 
Net income almost doubled to $3.46 billion, or $5.59 a
share, from $1.81 billion, or $3.39, a year earlier, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate
of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $4.14 per share.
Predictions ranged from $3.33 to $5.97. 
The results showed Goldman Sachs maintained its dominance
in fixed-income trading, the biggest source of Wall Street&#8217;s
revenue. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is trying to
preserve the bank&#8217;s place as the most profitable investment bank
in Wall Street history while defending it against regulators&#8217;
claims that the company misled investors in 2007. 
&#8220;Goldman is continuing to take market share, and I think
that&#8217;s the key move for them coming out of the financial
crisis,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investment
LLC, which manages $5 billion, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;Goldman is a clear winner as people are trying to
figure out who they are going to do business with.&#8221; 
Shareholders said concern about potential fallout from the
accusations would supersede news about earnings. The stock,
which fell 13 percent after the SEC filed its case on April 16,
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday on news that the SEC was split
over whether to file the suit. The shares rose to $163.45 at
7:48 a.m. from $163.32 at the close on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday. 
SEC Case 
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, played a part in selecting the underlying
assets. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest&#8221; the case. 
Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the SEC&#8217;s
lawsuit in today&#8217;s statement, saying only, &#8220;In light of recent
events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of our
clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment of
our people.&#8221; 
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, will address
the SEC&#8217;s complaint in a conference call today, the company said
in a statement yesterday. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
will discuss earnings, the company said. 
Bank&#8217;s Reputation 
Ralph Cole, a senior vice president in research at Ferguson
Wellman Inc., is among investors who said they are concerned the
case could hurt Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation and cause clients to
switch their business to other firms. Another worry is that the
case could lead to additional lawsuits against the bank and add
impetus to financial-reform efforts that would erode Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s earnings potential. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the cost of this one suit&#8217;s the big deal,
not certainly compared to what they make,&#8221; said Cole, whose
firm manages $2.6 billion including Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It&#8217;s
what does this do to their reputation and what does this do to
the industry because of the current legislation going through?&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said revenue from fixed-income, currencies
and commodities trading, which contributed more than half of
revenue last year, rose 13 percent in the first quarter to an
all-time high of $7.39 billion from $6.56 billion. That beat
estimates for $5.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit Suisse
Group AG and $6.09 billion from Roger Freeman at Barclays
Capital. 
Bank of America 
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, both reported record fixed-income
revenue last week of $5.52 billion and $5.46 billion
respectively. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at a great year for capital markets
firms,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of Second Curve Capital LLC and
founder of bankstocks.com, said yesterday. 
Equities-trading revenue rose 18 percent to $2.35 billion
from $2 billion a year earlier, Goldman Sachs said. Gains from
principal investments, which includes the company&#8217;s stakes in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. as well as real
estate and other companies, were $510 million compared with a
net loss of $1.41 billion in the first quarter of 2009. 
Investment-banking revenue climbed 44 percent to $1.18
billion from $823 million last year. Within that, fees from
financial advice fell 12 percent to $464 million from $527
million and equity-underwriting revenue surged to $371 million
from $48 million. Debt underwriting generated $349 million
compared with $248 million a year earlier. 
Compensation and benefits, the firm&#8217;s biggest expense,
increased 17 percent to $5.49 billion in the quarter, or 43
percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost compared with
$4.71 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when the firm set
aside 50 percent of revenue.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s problems
with the Securities and Exchange Commission are spilling over
into the U.S. midterm elections. 
Congressman Mark Kirk, the Republican nominee for an open
Senate seat in Illinois, said he will return contributions made
by Goldman employees because the SEC is investigating the bank. 
Kirk, 50, made the announcement after his Democratic
opponent, Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, criticized him
for taking the donations. The two men are vying for the Senate
seat once held by President Barack Obama that will help
determine whether Democrats retain control of the chamber. 
&#8220;We are calling on Congressman Kirk to explain why he
voted against Wall Street reform,&#8221; said Matt McGrath, a
spokesman for Giannoulias. &#8220;And we are challenging him to give
back his tainted Goldman Sachs campaign contributions.&#8221; 
Kirk has taken $54,010 from Goldman employees, including
$21,600 for his Senate bid, McGrath said. 
The congressman said that his campaign is still determining
how much Goldman employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. 
&#8220;I want to set an example on ethics for others to
follow,&#8221; Kirk said yesterday during a Chicago news conference.
&#8220;I will err on the side of caution and watch this case
unfold.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. said signings of first-quarter service contracts fell,
signaling that spending on larger technology projects may not
pick up until the second half of the year. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
total revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, IBM,
the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, said yesterday
in a statement. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. 
Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler, who
recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York fell 2.2 percent to $129.38
in late trading yesterday after rising $1.60 to $132.23 on the
New York Stock Exchange. It had gained 1 percent this year
before today, compared with a 7.4 percent advance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. 
Full-Year Forecast 
IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
been up 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. 
Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. 
IBM said profit this year will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts predicted
$11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Still, the company has yet to signal that profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than steps like costs cutting and
stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint
AmTech in San Francisco. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;Really good
financial management from an earnings perspective. At the end of
the day, not much from a revenue perspective.&#8221; 
Currency Effect 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in its
higher-margin software and services units, which now make up
more than 80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost
gross profit margins, the percentage of sales left after
production costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year
basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. U.S. government plans to put patient health records
online may spur more than $20 billion in spending, Framingham,
Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.

Morgan Stanley climbed the most in
three months on the New York Stock Exchange after posting
earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates on higher fixed-income
trading revenue. 
The shares rose 4 percent after the New York-based bank
said first-quarter net income was $1.78 billion, or 99 cents a
share. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.03 a share,
including a 21-cent tax benefit, compared with the 57-cent
average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income results, the best since the
third quarter of 2008, follow record revenue from debt trading
reported earlier this month by Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer
James Gorman, who succeeded John Mack in January, said in a
letter to shareholders last week he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the
company&#8217;s performance in 2009 and the firm had hired 350
employees as part of a &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of sales and trading. 
&#8220;This was really surprising,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of hedge
fund Second Curve Capital LLC in New York, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Given the previous four quarters, where
they really looked like the weak sister, this quarter they
really stepped out. These were great numbers.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley climbed $1.23 to $31.68 at 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching
$32.29 earlier today. The shares have gained 7 percent this
year, compared with a 5.9 percent drop for Goldman Sachs and a
16 percent increase in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index. 
SEC&#8217;s Case 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares fell 5.6 percent on April 16, as
the SEC accused Goldman Sachs of failing to tell investors in a
2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, played a part in
selecting the underlying assets. Goldman Sachs has said the
SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that
it plans to &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the case. 
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a
conference call with analysts today that the firm has not
received a Wells notice, a signal of the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s intention to pursue a lawsuit, regarding its
collateralized debt obligations business. 
Revenue from fixed-income sales and trading jumped to $2.7
billion in the quarter from $1.29 billion a year earlier. That
beat estimates for $1.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit
Suisse Group AG and $2.04 billion from Keith Horowitz at
Citigroup Inc. 
&#8216;Coming Back&#8217; 
&#8220;The fixed-income franchise is coming back for Morgan
Stanley,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel
Investment LLC, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;The
history of this organization is that it&#8217;s very strong on the
fixed-income side.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs reported fixed-income revenue of $7.39
billion yesterday. Bank of America and JPMorgan, the two biggest
U.S. banks by assets, both beat analysts&#8217; earnings estimates
last week as they posted fixed-income revenue of $5.52 billion
and $5.46 billion, respectively. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s profit compared with a loss of $177
million, or 57 cents, in the first quarter of 2009, the bank
said today in a statement. Revenue more than tripled to $9.08
billion. 
Morgan Stanley generated $887 million in revenue from
investment banking, up from $811 million a year earlier. In
equities trading, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s $1.42 billion of first-
quarter revenue was up from $954 million a year earlier. The
unit&#8217;s revenue compares with $2.35 billion at Goldman Sachs and
$1.5 billion at JPMorgan. 
Smith Barney 
Global wealth management posted pretax income of $278
million, compared with $119 million in the first quarter of
2009, as the unit benefited from its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. Asset management reported a
pretax profit of $173 million, compared with a pretax loss of
$283 million in the previous year&#8217;s first quarter. 
Morgan Stanley recorded a $932 million loss on its $1.2
billion investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC, the
developer of an unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Porat said the company plans to dispose of the
investment in the next 12 months. 
The Revel loss was partly offset by a $775 million payment
Morgan Stanley received from Discover Financial Services to
resolve a legal dispute. Both were included in discontinued
operations. 
Wealth Management 
The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage&#8217;s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. 
&#8220;That progression is what we&#8217;re looking at as an
indication that the integration is continuing on track,&#8221; Porat
said in an interview. &#8220;The revenues are pretty flat from the
fourth quarter, and that reflects a more muted retail
environment. Retail investors just weren&#8217;t as active.&#8221; 
Net new client assets in the unit were $5.8 billion, the
highest since the third quarter of 2008. The unit had 18,140
advisers as of March 31 as turnover was at &#8220;historic lows,&#8221;
Porat said. 
Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.4 billion in the
quarter, or 49 percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost
compared with $2.08 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when
the firm set aside 68 percent of revenue. 
The compensation ratio was 41 percent in the institutional
securities business, which includes the trading and investment
banking units, and 64 percent in the wealth-management division.
Porat said the firm aims to reduce the ratio in the brokerage as
revenue increases.

Asia weathered the &#8220;Lehman shock&#8221;
of 2008 with impressive calm. Now it is being tested by a jolt
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Markets recoiled at the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud suit against Goldman. On April 19,
stocks fell the most in two months on concern that financial
companies face greater scrutiny. By the following day, all was
forgotten in Asia. 
Perhaps it dawned on traders that the SEC action is good
for the region. Its resilience amid the global crisis and
progress in decoupling from the West haven&#8217;t changed. Looking
forward, anything that brings real reform to the biggest economy
is stellar news for Asia and the rest of the world. 
When you consider the tests of the last 19 months, such as
a global credit crunch, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
bankruptcy and Greece&#8217;s deficit woes, the odds of Asia escaping
any fallout looked grim. Especially with Japan beset by
deflation and China reliant on U.S. consumers living beyond
their means. Asia has managed to confound the skeptics, and that
isn&#8217;t about to change. 
Even the big challenge of central banks falling behind the
inflation curve is an enviable one. In Washington and Frankfurt,
the focus is on monetary policy&#8217;s limits. Near-zero interest
rates aren&#8217;t boosting growth as fast as they were supposed to.
The troubles facing officials in Hanoi and Seoul are preferable. 
Bank Stocks 
It&#8217;s worth noting that bank shares in countries such as
China and India have outperformed global rivals by about 30
percentage points since Lehman blew up in September 2008. That
dynamic should continue and even gain steam. 
A couple of years ago, many global investors considered
Asia&#8217;s regulatory environment too strict and inhibiting of
financial innovation. Nowadays, that conservatism is a virtue.
The health of Asian balance sheets and the reasonable pace of
loan growth relative to the U.S. and Europe explain why
investors are heading this way. 
Asia is hardly devoid of problems. It has done well on a
macroeconomic level during this crisis, yet it&#8217;s also been hit
hard below the surface. 
&#8220;We have 70 million-plus people still mired in poverty as
a result of the financial crisis,&#8221; Rajat Nag, managing director
of the Asian Development Bank, said on April 19. Nag, for one,
is &#8220;very pleased&#8221; with the SEC&#8217;s move to go after Goldman. 
Tightrope Walking 
Central banks have quite a bit of tightrope walking to do.
They need to be mindful of struggling households. They also must
mop up liquidity to avoid excessive asset prices. Indonesia is a
case in point: Even the central bank agrees Jakarta&#8217;s stock
market is a bubble. 
Japan&#8217;s woes are growing, too. Asia&#8217;s biggest economy was
hit hard by the financial crisis. Yet Japan&#8217;s experience jibes
with the nature of the turmoil. This crisis didn&#8217;t go to the
periphery of the global economy, but to its core. It&#8217;s the Group
of Seven economies that are reeling, not developing ones. 
The Lehman shock gave way to the &#8220;Toyota shock,&#8221; which
really was a two-part process. The first was the plunge in
Toyota Motor Corp. sales in late 2008 and into 2009. The second
was the celebrated brand&#8217;s car-safety debacle. 
If there is a silver lining here, it&#8217;s that Asia is proving
adept at living without Japan. Strong growth from China and
India don&#8217;t fill the void left by a hobbled U.S., yet it&#8217;s
helping. And so, the Asia decoupling argument gets to live on
until challenged anew by the next global crisis. 
U.S. Reform 
On that front, Goldman&#8217;s plight is actually good news.
Surprise on the part of Asian investors at the lack of financial
reform in Washington gave way to disillusionment. Signs that
U.S. regulators are finally trying to exact some justice from
Wall Street could change everything. 
That the effort involves Goldman Sachs means it&#8217;s a bit
loaded. Schadenfreude abounded last year when a Rolling Stone
magazine writer labeled Goldman a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity.&#8221; It&#8217;s an image that captured how
many in Asia viewed Wall Street following the region&#8217;s 1997
crisis. American funds came in, wrapped their tentacles around
assets and bought them on the cheap. 
A functioning U.S. financial industry is one thing; a
sustainable one is equally important. American has been sending
financial contagion Asia&#8217;s way for the past 18 months, just as
Asia sent it to the West a decade earlier. The key for the
global economy is to avoid a repeat of either scenario. 
Until now, there has been scant evidence that the U.S. was
righting its anything-goes model. The SEC&#8217;s Goldman suit is just
the tip of the iceberg. As such actions spread and financial
executives are made accountable, Asia can look forward to the
day when U.S. markets are sounder destinations for their
trillions of dollars of savings. 
Asia is working to wean itself off the U.S. In the
meantime, what&#8217;s good for the world&#8217;s dominant financial power
is good for Asia. Unlike the Lehman one, the Goldman shock may
be just the thing for this region&#8217;s prosperity.

 Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, booked a $932 million loss on its
investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC, the developer of an
unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
The loss on the $1.2 billion investment was included in the
New York-based firm&#8217;s first-quarter results today, according to
a statement. Morgan Stanley said this month it will sell the
stalled casino on 20 acres of beachfront property along Atlantic
City&#8217;s boardwalk. 
Morgan Stanley bought the land for $74 million in 2006.
Planned as the biggest casino resort in Atlantic City, Revel
needs more than $1 billion to complete the project. Morgan
Stanley, which owns 95 percent of the development, contributed
the land to developer Kevin DeSanctis and funded construction. 
&#8220;The intent was to build it out and eventually sell it,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview today. &#8220;With the ongoing weakness in Atlantic City,
our judgment was that we do not want to put more money into it.
We would be better off selling it to a more natural owner.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley rose $1.30, or 4.3 percent, to $31.75 at
11:23 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had gained 2.9 percent this year before today. 
Since 2008, the firm has been winding down Morgan Stanley
Principal Investments, the unit that invested in Revel and other
companies and projects for the bank&#8217;s own account, Mark Lake, a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, said today in an interview. 
Loan Negotiations 
Revel has been negotiating with the Export-Import Bank of
China for a loan to finish construction, New Jersey gaming
enforcement documents show. Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack
&#8220;recently spoke&#8221; to China Ex-Im&#8217;s chairman about loan terms,
according to documents dated Feb. 17 and submitted to the
state&#8217;s casino commission by the Division of Gaming Enforcement. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Lake declined to comment on the documents. 
&#8220;Revel remains fully engaged in discussions with potential
lenders on securing the remaining capital required to complete
the interior fit-out of the property and the completion of the
construction phase of the project,&#8221; Joe Jaffoni, an outside
spokesman for Revel, said today in an e-mail. &#8220;Once final
financing is secured, we estimate it will take 20 months to
complete and open the facility.&#8221; 
Atlantic City gambling revenue tumbled a record 13 percent
last year, the third straight annual decline, after nearby
states allowed slot machines. Six of the 11 New Jersey casinos
wound up in bankruptcy or restructuring, and development has
stalled. New Jersey&#8217;s budget last month projected the casinos
may generate 12 percent less in tax revenue in the coming fiscal
year.

Morgan Stanley, which reported
earnings today that beat analyst&#8217;s estimates, said the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 17 percent in the
first quarter. 
Value-at-risk in commodity prices, a measure of how much
the firm estimates it might lose in a single day, rose to $27
million in the three months ended March 31 from $23 million in
the preceding quarter, the company said. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history, said yesterday that the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 29 percent in the
first quarter. 
Value-at-risk rose to $49 million in the three months ended
March 31 from $38 million in the preceding quarter, the company

The nation&#8217;s largest banks are
pumping more money into the battle over the rewriting of the
rules of finance as legislation heads to a vote in the Senate as
early as this week. 
Six of the top 10 U.S. banks by assets, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley,
ramped up donations to lawmakers from their political action
committees in the last month, according to reports filed for
yesterday&#8217;s Federal Election Commission deadline. 
Goldman, Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp were among
seven banks that increased the amount spent on lobbying during
the first three months of the year compared with the same period
in 2009, separate reports filed with Congress showed. The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce doubled its lobbying spending in the first
quarter. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re in the endgame,&#8221; said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer
program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
which is pressing for stronger regulations. &#8220;They&#8217;re all-in to
defeat reform.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.,
all based in New York, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. each donated
more to federal candidates in March than in the previous two
months combined.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
signaled it will fight a U.S. lawsuit over subprime mortgage
instruments the same way Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch
unit and UBS AG have challenged similar claims -- by invoking
the concept of caveat emptor: Latin for buyer beware. 
The strategy may work. By insisting that purchasers of
collateralized debt obligations knew what they were getting
into, Goldman Sachs is following a well-traveled path. Both
Merrill and UBS won dismissal of similar claims that they
misrepresented the risks of such assets by saying the buyers
were sophisticated enough to know better. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of creating and selling the CDOs without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the instrument. Goldman Sachs denied any
wrongdoing, saying that it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to
customers about the risks. 
Goldman Sachs, whose mantra is clients&#8217; interests always
come first, has said &#8220;these are sophisticated investors who
knew what they were buying,&#8221; said David Irwin, a former federal
prosecutor in private practice in Towson, Maryland. The bank is
arguing that the average buyer of this product isn&#8217;t some
&#8220;credit union that didn&#8217;t know what it was doing,&#8221; he said. 
In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market began to falter,
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO vehicle, known as Abacus,
linking it to bundles of subprime mortgages whose value would
rise or fall depending on whether homeowners paid them off. 
The SEC alleged in its April 16 complaint that, had Goldman
Sachs customers known Paulson helped choose the securities that
formed the basis of the CDO, and that Paulson was betting
against them, they might not have bought any. The regulator&#8217;s
case in Manhattan federal court may hinge on that issue, said
lawyer Mark Zauderer of New York&#8217;s Flemming Zulack Williamson
Zauderer LLC, who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. 
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
CDOs and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
Goldman Sachs also said yesterday that the U.S. case hinges
on the actions of an employee it placed on paid leave this week. 
 Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about the
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will be de-registered from
the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm in London said yesterday. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; 
By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publicly distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. 
Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP in
New York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. The New York-
based bank has denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the
SEC&#8217;s case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and
fact.&#8221; 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).

Legal Reviews 
BHP Says It Found Evidence of Possible Corruption 
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
found evidence of possible breaches of anti-corruption laws
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information for an investigation. 
BHP identified &#8220;possible violations of applicable anti-
corruption laws involving interactions with government
officials,&#8221; Melbourne-based BHP said today in a statement. The
U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office said BHP &#8220;opened a dialogue&#8221; and
is cooperating. 
The company said the probe into the termination of some
minerals exploration projects didn&#8217;t involve its business in China, where four Rio Tinto Group executives were jailed last
month for bribery. U.S. regulators have increased scrutiny of
corporate governance and compliance following the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
The SEC couldn&#8217;t &#8220;confirm or deny the existence or non-
existence of any investigation,&#8221; John Nester, a Washington-
based spokesman, said in an e-mail. 
BHP &#8220;has been in to see us,&#8221; David Jones, a spokesman for
the U.K.&#8217;s SFO, said in an e-mail. The Australian Securities and
Investments Commission couldn&#8217;t comment, spokeswoman Georgie
Morell said. 
BHP has exploration projects in Chile, Zambia, Australia,
Gabon, South America, Russia, West Africa and Canada, the
company said today in its quarterly exploration report, in which
it revealed the probe.

Goldman Faces Formal U.K. Probe After SEC Fraud Suit 
The London units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, will be formally
investigated by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator after U.S.
authorities sued the bank for fraud. 
The Financial Services Authority said in a statement
yesterday that it will begin a formal probe after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. The FSA
said yesterday it was reviewing whether a full investigation
into the New York-based bank was warranted. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the agency, which he
created in 1997, to investigate Goldman Sachs, accusing
employees of the bank of &#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; The bank may be
fined or individuals banned if the FSA finds a breach of its
rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president named in the SEC case,
Fabrice Tourre, works at the bank&#8217;s London office. 
&#8220;The U.K. entity, Goldman Sachs International, is not
mentioned in the SEC complaint, but the FSA&#8217;s latest move means
that this part of Goldman Sachs is now under the spotlight
too,&#8221; said Clive Cunningham, a regulatory lawyer at Taylor
Wessing LLP who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &#8220;The question is
whether Goldman Sachs International was involved and, if so, did
it breach any U.K. regulatory rules.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs will cooperate with the FSA&#8217;s investigation,
the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank has
previously denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s
case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
Tourre, 31, has been placed on paid leave until an
unspecified date, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said yesterday.
Pamela Chepiga, Tourre&#8217;s lawyer at Allen  Overy LLP in New
York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment.

New Suits 
Staten Island Investment Adviser Charged With Fraud 
Gryphon Holdings Inc.&#8217;s owner and four employees of the
Staten Island, New York-based investment firm were charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in an
alleged $17.5 million scheme. 
Kenneth Marsh, 43, Gryphon&#8217;s president, and the employees,
who are accused of falsely claiming endorsements from financier
George Soros, are scheduled to appear in court yesterday,
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell said in an e-mailed
statement. 
Investors, usually elderly retirees, received unsolicited
e-mails and phone calls touting Gryphon&#8217;s services, according to
the statement. Once the victims provided contact information,
Gryphon&#8217;s employees used high-pressure tactics and
misrepresentations to sell more expensive versions of their
services, Campbell said.

Banca Carige Sues Citigroup Over Note, Swap Deal 
 Banca Carige SpA sued Citigroup Inc. for misrepresenting as
safe a deal that allegedly cost the northern Italian bank almost
all of its $47 million investment. 
Citigroup put its own interests above Banca Carige&#8217;s in
January 2007 when it sold 10 million euros ($13.5 million) in a
fund-linked note to the bank&#8217;s insurance units and entered into
a 25 million euro fund-linked total return swap with Banca
Carige, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan. 
Banca Carige and the insurers &#8220;had no interest in risky or
speculative investments, and were looking only to obtain good,
consistent returns with as little risk as possible,&#8221; the Genoa-
based bank wrote in its complaint. 
Citigroup knew the investors&#8217; objectives and misrepresented
that the deal was a low-risk investment because the note and the
swap were linked to an offshore bond fund that &#8220;earned reliable
returns through an &#8216;arbitrage opportunity&#8217; with municipal
bonds,&#8221; Banca Carige said. 
&#8220;Citi believes these claims are without merit and we will
defend ourselves vigorously,&#8221; Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based company, said by e-mail. 
The case is Banca Carige SpA v. Citigroup Inc., 10-cv-3310,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Household International Sues Insurer Over Coverage 
Household International Inc., found liable last year by a
Chicago jury for misleading investors about the company&#8217;s
business practices, sued an insurance company in a bid to force
payment of its legal bills. 
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co., based in Hamilton,
Bermuda, is refusing to provide $25 million of coverage,
contending that some of the claims in the lawsuit predate Nov.
1, 2000, when the policy went into effect, Household Financial
said yesterday in documents in federal court in Chicago. 
&#8220;It is virtually certain that the entire limits of the
Princeton policy will be needed for ongoing defense costs,&#8221;
Household said in its statement of claim. &#8220;Princeton flatly
denied Household&#8217;s request for payment.&#8221; 
The jury last May 8 found the company and three executives
including Chief Executive Officer William Aldinger, misled
investors from 1994 to 2005 with reckless remarks in financial
statements, inflating the value of the shares. 
The insurance case is Household International Inc. v.
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co. 1:10-cv-02418. U.S. District
Court, and the shareholder suit is Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension
Plan v. Household International Inc., 1:02-cv-05893, U.S.

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Judge Calls New York&#8217;s Greenberg Case &#8216;Devastating&#8217; 
New York&#8217;s case against American International Group Inc.&#8217;s
former Chief Executive Officer Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg is
&#8220;devastating,&#8221; State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos said
yesterday during a court hearing. 
The judge is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2005 by
then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that accused
Greenberg, 84, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard
Smith of using sham reinsurance deals and other transactions to
distort the reported financial condition of the company. 
Assistant Attorney General David Ellenhorn yesterday told
Ramos that Greenberg directed or participated in fraudulent
transactions. David Boies, Greenberg&#8217;s lawyer, said the state
had &#8220;failed&#8221; and was relying on hearsay and inadmissible
evidence from a federal case in which Greenberg wasn&#8217;t a
defendant. 
&#8220;I can see big problems with establishing a defense&#8221; to
the state&#8217;s claims about securities fraud, Ramos told Boies.
&#8220;Mr. Ellenhorn has put together a devastating case, a strong
case, and we both know it.&#8221; 
Greenberg&#8217;s lawyers and attorneys from New York Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s office are each asking Ramos in Manhattan
to grant their motion for summary judgment, or a decision before
trial. Greenberg has also asked, in the alternative, for Ramos
to dismiss the lawsuit. The former CEO wasn&#8217;t in court
yesterday. 
Greenberg has accused Spitzer of using the case to promote
his political career, according to a filing in state Supreme
Court. 
The case is New York v. Maurice Greenberg, 401720/2005, New
York Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).

Trials/Appeals 
Rorech Testifies in First Insider-Trading Default-Swap Case 
Jon-Paul Rorech, the Deutsche Bank AG bond salesman who&#8217;s a
defendant in U.S. regulators&#8217; first insider-trading case over
credit-default swaps, took the stand in the trial. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Rorech,
39, of illegally feeding information on a 2006 bond sale by
Dutch media company VNU Group BV to Renato Negrin, 46, a former
Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager. Negrin, Rorech&#8217;s co-
defendant, bought swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit when the
deal was announced, the SEC said in a complaint in May. 
Nancy Brown, an SEC lawyer, asked Rorech yesterday if he
understood in July 2006 that Deutsche Bank had &#8220;restricted&#8221;
VNU&#8217;s securities. 
&#8220;At one point I believe we were restricted from trading
securities but I did not believe I was restricted from
soliciting,&#8221; Rorech responded. &#8220;How can you market without
discussing what the relevant securities are?&#8221; 
Rorech, who is on paid administrative leave from Deutsche
Bank, is scheduled to continue his testimony today. U.S.
District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan is hearing the
nonjury trial, which began April 7. 
The SEC didn&#8217;t accuse Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or New
York-based hedge fund Millennium of wrongdoing. 
The commission&#8217;s civil suit focuses on efforts by VNU,
later renamed Nielsen Co., to restructure its debt as part of a
7.5 billion euro ($10 billion) leveraged buyout. 
After complaints from potential investors that the $1.67
billion in bonds wouldn&#8217;t be covered by existing VNU credit-
default swaps, VNU created a tranche of bonds that would be
covered. 
The SEC said Rorech tipped Negrin about the restructuring
before that announcement. Negrin bought 20 million euros of
swaps, and profited by selling them after the deal was announced
and the swap price rose, the SEC said. 
Negrin is liable because he knew, or should have known,
Rorech had a duty to keep the information private, the SEC said. 
Rorech and Negrin argue that the SEC has no jurisdiction
over the credit-default swaps because they are private
contracts, not securities. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). 
Former IKB Chief May Call More Witnesses After Goldman Case 
Former IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Ortseifen may call more witnesses at his German
criminal trial following the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Ortseifen, 59, is on trial on charges that he failed to
warn investors about the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market before the bank was forced to seek a government bailout.
The bank lost nearly all of its $150 million investment in the
subprime-mortgage related products at the center of the SEC case
against Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;We are considering calling more and other people to
witness in the case,&#8221; Rainer Hamm, his lawyer, said in an
interview at a court in Dusseldorf, Germany, where Ortseifen is
being tried for misleading investors. Ortseifen is observing the
Goldman development &#8220;with big interest&#8221; and it is too early to
say if he will change his defense strategy, the lawyer said. 
IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has received guarantees of as much as 12
billion euros ($16.2 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue fund.
Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by downplaying
the effect of the real estate crisis in a press release on July
20, 2007. Ortseifen stepped down nine days later and shares of
IKB fell 20 percent. 
The SEC says a Goldman executive misled a collateral
manager, ACA Management LLC, and IKB about Paulson&#8217;s role. 
The German case is LG Dusseldorf, 14 KLs 6/09.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Schwab Agrees to Pay $200 Million in Fund Settlement 
 Charles Schwab Corp. said it agreed to pay $200 million to
settle claims that it misled investors on the amount of
mortgage-backed securities held by its Schwab YieldPlus Fund. 
Schwab signed a memorandum of understanding to settle the
claims filed in 2008 by paying the $200 million to plaintiffs,
without admitting liability and avoiding trial, the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a statement. The
settlement agreement cuts first-quarter net income by $105
million, or 9 cents a share, bringing the company&#8217;s net income
reported last week down to $14 million, or 1 cent per share. 
The lawsuit alleged that Schwab incorrectly described the
fund, once the world&#8217;s largest short-term bond fund, as
&#8220;safe.&#8221; The plaintiffs sought damages of as much as $802
million, the estimate of losses made by their lawyers&#8217; experts.
A trial was scheduled for May. 
Schwab had denied wrongdoing, saying the fund&#8217;s losses were
caused by the collapse of the financial markets. U.S. District
Judge William H. Alsup denied Schwab&#8217;s bid to dismiss the case
earlier this month. 
The case is In Re Charles Schwab Corp. Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-01510, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). 
Schottenfeld Settlement in Galleon SEC Case Approved 
Schottenfeld Group LLC won a judge&#8217;s approval of a $763,000
settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading investigation. 
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York approved the
agreement in an order yesterday. Schottenfeld Group agreed to
pay $460,475 in disgorgement, $72,203 in interest and a $230,238
civil penalty, according to a March 29 letter from the SEC to
Rakoff. The firm also agreed to implement policies to assure
compliance with securities laws. 
Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam is accused in both civil and
criminal cases of using secret tips from hedge fund executives,
corporate officials and other insiders to earn millions of
dollars in illegal stock trades. Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi,
a New Castle Funds LLC consultant, are among 21 people who were
charged criminally since October in two overlapping insider
trading cases. 
Zvi Goffer and David Plate, formerly of Schottenfeld Group,
have pleaded not guilty in the criminal case. Gautham Shankar, a
former trader at Schottenfeld Group, pleaded guilty and is
cooperating with prosecutors. 
Schottenfeld Group&#8217;s disgorgement represents the amount the
firm either profited or avoided losing in the Galleon case,
according to the SEC&#8217;s letter. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
SEC case is SEC v. Galleon Management LP, 09-cv-08811, U.S.

Ex-Siemens Managers Get Suspended Terms Over Bribery 
Two former managers at Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s biggest
engineering company, were found guilty of breach of trust by a
Munich court and received suspended sentences and fines. 
A former unit chief executive officer, identified only as
Joerg Michael K., 55, received a suspended sentence of two years
and was ordered to pay 160,000 euros ($215,000), the Munich
court said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The head of
accounting at the unit, Hans-Werner H., 55, received an 18-month
suspended sentence and was ordered to pay 40,000 euros. 
&#8220;Both men tolerated and supported a system of slush funds
at Siemens,&#8221; the court said. The system was &#8220;set up for the
sole purpose of paying bribes.&#8221; 
Siemens, based in Munich, has been embroiled in a bribery
scandal since 2006, leading to investigations in at least a
dozen countries, revealing it paid kickbacks and bribes to win
contracts. Siemens agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle probes
in the U.S. and Germany in 2008. Prosecution of individual
managers has been ongoing. 
Joerg Michael K., who joined Siemens in 1974, became the
head of the communications unit in 2001. He was told about the
system of slush funds and chose not to stop it. He later gave
another Siemens employee in charge of organizing the system
powers to sign sham contracts. 
Hans-Werner H., who learned about the scheme in 2003,
didn&#8217;t have his accounting staff thoroughly review the
transactions, according to the court. Between 2002 and 2004, the
system put 49 million euros in the slush funds which were used
for bribery. 
Boehringer Agrees to Settle Wisconsin Medicaid Suit 
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, the world&#8217;s largest privately
held drugmaker, agreed to pay $7.75 million to settle Wisconsin
claims that it overcharged a government health program for
medicine. 
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim
Roxane, Roxane Laboratories and Ben Venue Laboratories, all
units of Boehringer, agreed to pay the state Medicaid program $7
million and $750,000 to Miner, Barnhill  Galland PC for legal
fees, in a settlement announced yesterday by Wisconsin Attorney
General J.B. Van Hollen. 
&#8220;This settlement again demonstrates to anyone who attempts
to defraud medical assistance programs that my office will
pursue them to the fullest extent of the law,&#8221; Van Hollen said
in a statement. The state won&#8217;t &#8220;line the pockets of those who
would engage in deceptive and fraudulent pricing activities.&#8221; 
Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, complies with all
federal and state Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, Amy Kunkel,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;This case was settled to end expensive and disruptive
litigation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wisconsin acknowledged that the
settlement did not constitute an admission of fault or liability
by Boehringer.&#8221; 
The case is State of Wisconsin v. Abbott Inc., 04-cv-1709,
Dane County (Madison). 
Vodafone, O2 Win U.K. Appeal of Price Controls 
 Vodafone Group Plc, Telefonica SA&#8217;s O2 unit and other
mobile network operators overturned a U.K. ruling that applied
retroactive price controls that cut fees they charge to connect
callers from other networks. 
The Court of Appeal in London yesterday ruled that a lower
court couldn&#8217;t force the U.K.&#8217;s telecommunications regulator
Ofcom to apply a court-ordered reduction of limits on
&#8220;termination fees&#8221; back to 2007. The other operators are
France Telecom SA&#8217;s Orange unit and Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s T-Mobile. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied that the tribunal has no power to direct
Ofcom to impose revised price controls on a retrospective
basis,&#8221; said the three judge panel. The money involved in the
case amounts to &#8220;hundreds of millions of pounds,&#8221; the judges
said in the ruling. 
The ruling is a victory for Ofcom, which challenged a
finding by the Competition Appeal Tribunal that it should apply
price controls retroactively when charges are reduced further by
a court. Ofcom was ordered in 2009 to further cut price controls
it had already lowered in 2007. 
Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, and Simon Lloyd, a
spokesman for O2, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment.

Obama Considers Corporate Lawyer for Justice Department Job 
James M. Cole, a corporate defense lawyer who served as an
independent monitor of American International Group Inc., is
being vetted by the Obama administration for the No. 2 job at
the Justice Department, according to a person familiar with the
matter. 
Cole, a partner at Bryan Cave LLP in Washington and a
former Justice Department prosecutor, would replace former
Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden, who left office earlier
this year. If nominated by Obama, Cole would need to be
confirmed by the Senate. 
Cole was an official with the Justice Department for 13
years before entering private practice, according to his law
firm&#8217;s Web site. His law practice includes advising companies on
securities, regulatory and criminal law matters.

Lawyers Made $60,000 From U.K. Insider Scam, Prosecutors Say 
Two attorneys who worked at the London offices of U.S. law
firms made illegal trades in NeuTec Pharma Ltd. after the
company&#8217;s financial director leaked information about a proposed
takeover, prosecutors told a court. 
Andrew Rimmington, a former corporate partner at Dorsey 
Whitney LLP,  Michael McFall, an ex-corporate partner at
McDermott Will  Emery LLP and NeuTec&#8217;s former financial
director Peter King are on trial for insider trading in a case
brought by the Financial Services Authority. 
Prosecutor Michael Bowes said the two lawyers made a profit
of 39,000 pounds each ($60,000) in June 2006 after King gave
McFall an early warning about Basel-based Novartis AG&#8217;s plan to
purchase NeuTec. McFall then passed the information on to
Rimmington, Bowes said. The men deny wrongdoing. 
They will present their defense later in the case, which is
scheduled to last six weeks.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, won an appeals patent case in Germany
over its file allocation table technology, or FAT, that allows
older computer operating systems to run alongside new software
using long file names. 
The Federal Court of Justice granted Microsoft&#8217;s appeal
against a lower court ruling, the court said in an e-mail today.
The case concerned the validity of European Patent EP 0618 540
in Germany. After hearing the case yesterday, the country&#8217;s top
civil tribunal overturned a ruling by Germany&#8217;s Federal Patent
Court that said the patent must be voided as it didn&#8217;t contain
an invention of new technology. 
The technology can be used by devices including digital
cameras and automotive navigation systems. Microsoft, holding
equivalent U.S. patents, last year sued Dutch navigation-device
maker TomTom NV over the technology used in global-positioning
systems for cars. The companies settled. 
The patent protects technology that makes Microsoft&#8217;s MS-
DOS operating system, which can only handle files of up to eight
digits, compatible with applications that use longer names. It
allowed Microsoft to introduce its VFAT file system, making it
compatible with MS-DOS&#8217;s FAT file system. 
The Federal Patent Court had argued that the Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol, used for file storages on CD-ROMs, had
already introduced the method. 
The case is BGH, X ZR 27/07.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, told Japanese clients
the collateralized debt obligation at the center of a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit wasn&#8217;t sold in the country. 
Goldman Sachs also said its Japanese asset management unit
didn&#8217;t participate in structuring or selling the CDO, according
to a Japanese-language letter to clients, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg News. Representatives from the firm will
visit clients to provide additional explanation if requested,
the letter said. 
&#8220;We are explaining to our clients in Japan that the
synthetic CDO in question was not sold in Japan,&#8221; said Hiroko
Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. Matsumoto,
who confirmed the contents of the letter, said Japanese clients
began receiving it earlier this week. She declined to
comment on their responses. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
New York-based company misled investors in a collateralized debt
obligation, called Abacus 2007-AC1. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon
Brown has asked for Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority to
start an inquiry, as the ramifications of the suit affect the
company globally. 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO, which was
linked to subprime mortgages, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicle. The hedge fund wasn&#8217;t sued by the SEC. 
Goldman Sachs in its letter to Japanese clients said the
SEC suit is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
The bank said yesterday its net income rose 91 percent to
$3.46 billion, or $5.59 per share, in the three months through
March.

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
was sued by a former employee who said the bank fired him
without cause and breached a spinout agreement that allowed him
to leave with the private equity team and platform he managed. 
Varun Kumar Bery, former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Private Capital
Asia unit, filed the complaint on Monday against his former
employer in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance claiming damages
&#8220;in the region of US$30.8 million.&#8221; JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie
Cheung declined to comment on the matter. 
According to the complaint, Bery joined JPMorgan in January
2008 after negotiations with Gaby Abdelnour, the bank&#8217;s Asia-
Pacific chairman and chief executive officer, to establish a
private equity group within the firm. 
The complaint states that after a firm-wide reorganization
in 2009 when JPMorgan disbanded an investment-banking unit that
bet on leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and real estate, the head
of a new global special opportunities business, Chris Nicholas,
indicated the bank wouldn&#8217;t commit more capital to Bery&#8217;s group. 
Abdelnour told Bery that JPMorgan &#8220;did not intend to
permit&#8221; the spinout, or departure of the business, according to
the complaint. 
Bery, 51, alleges the bank later acknowledged through its
lawyers breaching the spinout agreement and &#8220;did not proceed
expeditiously, constructively or responsively with the
negotiations&#8221; of finalizing the spinout. 
The fund manager is seeking a court order for the bank to
carry out the agreement and to recover any losses due to the
delay. 
The case is HCCL9/2010 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First
Instance.

U.S. and European non-financial
companies may sell Kangaroo bonds for the first time in four
years to profit from historically-low currency swap costs,
according to Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty. 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. affiliate is in talks with
potential borrowers about sales of local-currency notes in
Australia, head of debt capital markets Robert Foale said in an
interview in Sydney, declining to name the companies. Vodafone
Group Plc raised A$265 million ($247 million) in August 2006 in
the last Kangaroo sale by a non-financial company, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll see new corporate names in the Kangaroo
market in the next six months, and over the next 12 months it
should build up some momentum,&#8221; Foale said. &#8220;If they can
access a new market, diversify funding and currency, and they
don&#8217;t have to pay up for it, it&#8217;s a great opportunity.&#8221; 
Scottish Power Ltd. and Vodafone were among overseas
companies that sold bonds in Australia before the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to retreat to
the relative safety of government debt, closing the Kangaroo
market to all but supranational lenders and state-backed
borrowers. JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised A$700 million from
Kangaroo notes last month after credit markets thawed.

Contributions from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. employees threaten to become toxic campaign assets
for both political parties facing elections this year. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard for Democrats to make the accusation
about Republicans because the president raised so much Goldman
Sachs money,&#8221; said John Feehery, a Republican political
strategist who advised former House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
Donations from the bank&#8217;s employees became an issue when
U.S. Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias pushed his Republican
opponent in Illinois to return such contributions after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a fraud lawsuit April
16 against Goldman Sachs. 
Giannoulias said the money sent to the campaign of his
opponent, Republican congressman Mark Kirk, is &#8220;tainted,&#8221;
without saying whether President Barack Obama should return
almost $1 million that bank employees contributed to his White
House bid. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs employees tend to have a lot of money that
they can give to politicians,&#8221; Feehery said. &#8220;They are very
good at reading the marketplace.&#8221; 
Obama and Democrats in Congress are proposing the most
sweeping financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
personal push by the president, who plans to deliver a speech on
the subject on April 22 at the Cooper Union in New York, comes
as Goldman reported its net income almost doubled in the first
quarter. 
California Cash 
Obama, 48, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Kirk, competing against Giannoulias for the seat once held
by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from Goldman employees, the
center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are Democratic Congressman
Michael McMahon of New York, Republican Senator Richard Shelby
of Alabama, and three other New York Democrats: Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand, Representative Scott Murphy and Senator Charles
Schumer. 
Gillibrand, 43, will wait to see whether Goldman loses its
case, said Matt Canter, a spokesman. 
&#8220;It is long-standing practice for the Gillibrand campaign
that if any contributor is found guilty of wrongdoing, then the
campaign immediately donates their contribution to charity,&#8221;
Canter said. 
Democratic Party officials dismissed the significance of
Goldman campaign contributions to Obama. 
&#8216;Tooth and Nail&#8217; 
&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement. 
Sevugan didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail query when asked
whether Obama plans to return money from Goldman Sachs
employees. Jen Psaki, a White House spokeswoman, deferred
questions about contributions to the DNC. 
Giannoulias, 34, the Illinois treasurer, criticized Kirk
April 19 for taking what he said totaled $21,600 from Goldman
Sachs employees for the Senate campaign. 
Kirk, a five-term congressman from Chicago&#8217;s northern
suburbs, said he wanted to &#8220;err on the side of caution&#8221; as the
SEC case unfolded. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas van Praag, declined to
comment yesterday on the question of contributions to Obama and
other politicians. 
Still Counting 
Kirk, 50, said that his campaign is still determining how
much Goldman Sachs employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. 
Goldman Sachs and its employees and family members gave
$5.9 million to candidates in the 2007-2008 election cycle, data
from the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics shows.
Three-quarters of that went to Democrats, the non-partisan group
said. 
Giannoulias&#8217;s campaign further criticized Kirk yesterday
for agreeing to return contributions to his Senate campaign and
not the full $54,010 it says Kirk has taken from Goldman
employees during his congressional career. 
&#8220;His artfully worded pledge to return contributions made
only in the current cycle offers a fig leaf of ethical
propriety, but in reality is nothing more than a typical
Washington politician&#8217;s trick,&#8221; Giannoulias spokesman Matt
McGrath said in a statement. 
Fraud Allegations 
The SEC filed a civil suit alleging Goldman failed to tell
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, helped
select the underlying assets. 
The bank has denied the SEC&#8217;s accusations and Greg Palm,
co-general counsel, told analysts on a conference call yesterday
that the firm didn&#8217;t intentionally mislead anyone. 
For Obama, Wall Street provided three of his seven biggest
sources of contributors for the 2008 presidential campaign. In
2007 and 2008, Goldman Sachs employees and family members gave
him $994,795, Citigroup Inc. $701,290, and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
$695,132. 
Kathleen Strand, a Giannoulias spokeswoman, declined to
provide a yes or no response when asked whether Obama should
give money back to Goldman employees. 
&#8220;Unlike President Obama, Republican Congressman Mark Kirk
takes Wall Street money hand over fist and then votes their way
every single time, including voting against Wall Street
reform,&#8221; she said in a statement. 
Kirk&#8217;s Money Lead 
Kirk raised $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2010
and ended the period with more than $3 million in the bank, his
campaign said April 7. 
Giannoulias raised $1.2 million during the first quarter
and ended the period with that amount in the bank, his campaign
said last week. 
The Senate seat in Illinois is held by Democrat Roland
Burris, who isn&#8217;t seeking a full term. Republicans are trying to
take advantage of ethical problems experienced by Illinois
Democrats, including a public corruption trial set to begin June
3 for former Governor Rod Blagojevich, who appointed Burris to
complete Obama&#8217;s term.

Apple Gets Patent for Digital Camera Color-Correction Technology 
Apple Inc., maker of the iPhone, iPod and iPad, received a
U.S. patent that may point the way to an iCamera for the
Cupertino, California-based company. 
Yesterday Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
tantalized investors with the promise of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; new
products. And April 15 Apple filed a patent-infringement
complaint with the International Trade Commission to block
imports of some Eastman Kodak Co. digital cameras 
Patent 7,701,489, which was issued to Apple April 20, is
for a method and apparatus for color correction in image-sensing
devices. The technology covered by the patent involved the use
of diffusers to determine the properties of the lighting
environment. 
This is in contrast to many digital cameras&#8217; dependence on
software&#8217;s predetermined assumptions about lighting, according
to the patent. 
Apple applied for this patent in May 2003, with the
assistance of Blakely, Sokoloff, Taylor  Zafman LLP of Los
Angeles. 
Yamaha Sued for Infringing Patents on Web Site Paper Models 
Yamaha Motor Co., the motorcycle maker second in size only
to Honda Motor Co., was sued for patent infringement by a
Chicago-based patent owner. 
Paper Models LLC accused Yamaha of infringing its patents
7,072,949 and 7,546,356, which were issued in July 2006 and June
2009 respectively. 
The two patents cover systems for providing paper model
replicas over a computer network. Yamaha&#8217;s &#8220;papercraft&#8221;
offerings on its Web site infringe these patents, Paper Models
claimed in a suit filed yesterday in federal court in Chicago. 
When accessed yesterday, the Yamaha Web site entertainment
section featured pattern sheets and instructions for making
paper models of motorcycles, animals and various Japanese
cultural artifacts such as festival shrines, doll displays and
Samurai helmets. 
Paper Models asked the court for an order barring Honda&#8217;s
future infringement of the two patents, and for money damages,
attorney fees and the costs of litigation, and requested that
any damage award be tripled. 
The patent holder is represented by Mark D. Roth of
Chicago&#8217;s Orum  Roth LLC. 
The case is Paper Models LLC v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 1:10-
cv-02459, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois

Bionovo Gets Patent for Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment  &#8216; 
Bionovo Inc. received a patent on a method of using a
Chinese medicinal herb for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer, the Emeryville, California-based company said in a
statement. 
Patent 7,700,136 covers the use of an extract of
Scutellaria barbata to arrest cancer cell growth and shrink
solid cancers. In addition to breast cancer, the patent also
covers the use of the extract to treat ovarian cancer. Bezielle
is Bionovo&#8217;s proprietary formulation of the extract. 
The extract is formed from the above-ground portions of the
plant in either a water or alcohol-based solution, according to
the patent. The plant is a member of the mint family. 
The patent was issued April 20. Bionovo applied for the
patent in November 2008, with the assistance of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich  Rosati of Palo Alto, California. 
According to the company statement, Bionovo has had two
positive Phase 1 clinical trials of Bezielle.

ACTA Text Released, Provides Damages Provisions, ISP Liability 
The parties to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
released a draft text of the accord yesterday, together with a
statement from the European Commission&#8217;s Directorate-General for
Trade that said &#8220;concerns&#8221; about the agreement &#8220;are
unfounded.&#8221; 
The U.S. is a party to the agreement, as are Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New
Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. 
Among the elements in the agreement is the question of
damages for infringement. According to the draft text, judicial
authorities should consider &#8220;any legitimate measure of value&#8221;
including lost profits, value of the infringed good or service
measured by market price, the suggested retail price or the
profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement. 
One section of the agreement appears to offer the
possibility of preventative action. Judicial authorities will
have the authority to issue an order intended to prevent &#8220;the
imminent infringement&#8221; of an IP right. 
This includes the provisions that customs authorities can,
on their own authority, act to &#8220;suspend the release&#8221; of goods
suspected of infringement. 
The agreement places the burden on Internet service
providers to &#8220;remove or disable access to infringing material
or infringing activity upon obtaining actual knowledge of the

Toyota Sued for Infringement by Owner of &#8216;Prove It!&#8217; Trademark 
Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s Toyota USA unit was sued for trademark
infringement by an Arizona resident who registered the phrase
&#8220;prove it!&#8221; as a U.S. trademark in 1998. 
Michael D. Calmese of Phoenix accused Toyota of breaching a
license agreement to use the phrase that ended Dec. 31, 2009.
Toyota used the phrase in its promotions after that date without
authorization, according to the complaint filed April 19 in
federal court in Phoenix. 
He claims that he is damaged by the automaker&#8217;s
unauthorized use of his mark, in light of &#8220;the negative image&#8221;
the Japanese automaker has as a result of its recent recalls of
defective autos. By Toyota&#8217;s &#8220;not coming clean about its
acceleration and brake problems,&#8221; Calmese has potentially been
damaged by the association&#8221; with the company, he said in his
pleadings. 
Calmese claims he&#8217;s won trademark disputes with other
companies, and asked the court to award him money damages, and
extra damaged intended to punish the automaker for its alleged
infringement. He also seeks an award of attorney fees,
litigation costs and an order barring future infringement of his
mark. 
He is unrepresented by counsel. 
The case is Calmese V. Toyota USA Inc., 2:10-cv-00857-JWS,
U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix) 
Singapore Raid Nets Counterfeit Electronics Worth $2.7 Million 
Four Singapore residents were arrested yesterday and
accused of being part of a syndicate that imported and sold
counterfeit electronics, the ChannelNewsAsia.com Web site
reported. 
Officers in the intellectual property rights branch of
Singapore&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Department seized more than
15,000 fake electronic items, mainly mobile phones, with an
estimated value of $3.7 million Singapore dollars ($2.7
million), according to the news Web site. 
The mobile phones were copies of well-known brands, and
were shipped from overseas, ChannelNewsAsia.com reported. 
This was the largest seizure of fake electronic goods in
three years, according to the news Web site. 
Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Livermore Lab Didn&#8217;t Take Nanotech Trade Secret, Jury Finds 
Lawrence Livermore National Security, operator of the U.S.
Energy Department&#8217;s Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, didn&#8217;t steal
trade secrets from a Bay Area inventor, a jury in California&#8217;s
Alameda County Superior Court said April 6. 
The jury rejected claims by Victor B. Kley and Berkeley,
California-based General Nanotechnology LLC that the lab stole a
nanotechnology process for the invention of a diamond capsule. 
The jury found that the lab officials and scientists were
researching design of nanodiamond capsules years before they
were aware of Kley&#8217;s design, the lab&#8217;s lawyers said in a
statement. The capsules are used in fusion experiments. 
Kley sued the lab management in California state court in
April 2008, alleging his technology was misappropriated and a
non-disclosure agreement was violated. He is a named inventor on
65 issued patents, according to the database of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office. 
The Livermore, California-based law was represented by
Patrick Michael, Dean Morehous and Nicole Norris of Chicago&#8217;s
Winston  Strawn LLP. 
The case is General Nanotechnology LLC v. Lawrence
Livermore National Security LLC, VG08384523, California Superior
Court, Alameda County.

Jersey-based financial adviser group said in a statement. 
Dansky joins from the Brattle Group where he was a
principle, with IP valuation and damages his area of expertise.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, reported third-quarter revenue that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions, a sign that
corporate customers may be putting off computer buying. 
Sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, compared with
analysts&#8217; estimates that were as high as $14.8 billion for the
quarter that ended March 31. Shares fell in late trading. 
While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding purchases of new machines and long-term
contracts. Investors held out for added evidence of a spending
resurgence after chipmaker Intel Corp. last week forecast rising
sales this quarter and record profit margins for 2010. 
&#8220;Expectations were for more, given the strength we&#8217;ve seen
in PC sales,&#8221; Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest
Securities, said in an interview from Portland, Oregon. He rates
the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and said he doesn&#8217;t own them. 
Microsoft fell $1.02, or 3.3 percent, to $30.37 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock
fell 3.9 percent last quarter, while the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500
Index rose 4.9 percent. 
Third-quarter net income rose 35 percent to $4.01 billion,
or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast of 42 cents in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded the $14.4 billion
average in the survey, reflecting rising demand for Windows 7,
the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship operating system. 
Putting Off Orders 
Still, some companies are reluctant to place orders that
stretch over years. Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was
$12.8 billion, according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. In January, Microsoft reported second-quarter
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates by 15 cents. 
&#8220;The deferred revenue was lower than expected, suggesting
that enterprise spending is still just beginning to recover,&#8221;
said Sarah Friar, a San Francisco-based analyst for Goldman
Sachs Group who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Microsoft. &#8220;Enterprise
spending is still making its way out of the downturn.&#8221; 
Microsoft said operating expenses for the year ending June
30 will be $26.1 billion to $26.3 billion, compared with a
January prediction of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. Microsoft
no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. 
Mixed Bag 
&#8220;Consumer demand is still strong, but we also saw for the
first time growth in business hardware spending,&#8221; said Peter
Klein, Microsoft&#8217;s chief financial officer, in an interview.
Yet, it&#8217;s still taking longer to close multiyear deals. The
company did have growth in billings for multiyear agreements, he
said. &#8220;We are starting to fill that pipeline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think it will resolve itself over time.&#8221; 
In the third quarter a year ago, net income was $2.98
billion, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $13.6 billion. 
Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. Intel, the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, last week indicated that recovery may be gathering
steam with a forecast for rising sales this quarter. 
&#8220;People had thought there would be closer correlation
between what Intel said about PC demand and PC outlook&#8221; and
Microsoft&#8217;s results, said Sasa Zorovic, a Boston-based
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem to
be the case.&#8221; He rates the shares &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Office 
Still, International Business Machines Corp. reported a
drop in services signings, showing corporate spending on larger
technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Microsoft Business Division revenue, mostly from Office
productivity software, fell 5.9 percent to $4.24 billion as some
customers held off purchases before Microsoft begins rolling out
a new version next month. Server software sales were $3.58
billion, missing estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS AG. 
While sales of server computers have started to recover, it
will take longer for sales of Microsoft&#8217;s related software to
come back, Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. 
Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. Personal-computer shipments rose
27 percent last quarter, according to Gartner Inc. The PC market
bounced back from the year-earlier period, when the recession
dragged down shipments almost 7 percent -- the worst performance
since 2001, according to market research firm IDC. 
Business, Bing 
Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division was reduced as the
company deferred some sales to a future quarter. The company
gave customers who have purchased older versions of Office the
right to upgrade to the new version, Office 2010, which is
available to businesses next month. It hits stores in June. 
Online advertising revenue rose 19 percent as search and
graphical display ad markets recovered, Klein said.&#160;Sales in the
company&#8217;s online business rose 11.6 percent to $566 million. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine has increased the company&#8217;s
share of searches by 3.7 percentage points since Microsoft
overhauled the product in June, according to research firm
ComScore Inc. Microsoft had 11.7 percent of the U.S. search
market in March, compared with 65.1 percent for Google Inc. and
16.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., according to ComScore.

While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer purchases of personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding spending on new machines and contracts
with the Redmond, Washington-based software maker. Customers may
also be refraining from deals that stretch over multiple years. 
&#8220;Investors have been looking for reasons to sell stocks,
even when the results are good,&#8221; Todd Lowenstein,
a fund manager for Highmark Capital Management, said in an
interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;They needed to deliver
near-perfect execution.&#8221; 
Microsoft fell $1.40, or 4.5 percent, to $29.99 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock

no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. 
Last Quarter&#8217;s Performance 
A year earlier, net income was $2.98 billion, or 33 cents a
share, on sales of $13.6 billion. Net income in that period
included severance costs and impairments to investments. 
In the second quarter, Microsoft beat analysts&#8217; estimates
for profit by 15 cents a year. Yet the company raised investors&#8217;
concerns by saying that gains were fueled by consumer demand as
business demand remained sluggish. Shares fell the day after the
report. 
Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, last week
indicated that recovery may be gathering steam with a forecast
for rising sales this quarter. 
Intel&#8217;s View 
Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini told analysts
corporate executives are starting to replace aging machines.
Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. 
Still, International Business Machines Corp. shares dropped
yesterday after the company reported a drop in services
signings, showing corporate spending on larger technology
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;It will be a gradual business cycle -- it&#8217;s not something
that happens in a single quarter,&#8221; Parakh said. &#8220;It will be
something that that goes on for a year or two, but it&#8217;s
important because Microsoft gets significant uplift from the
business versions of Windows.&#8221; 
PC Shipments 
Personal-computer shipments rose 27 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. That topped Gartner&#8217;s prediction of a
22 percent rise. The PC market bounced back from the year-
earlier period, when the recession dragged down shipments almost
7 percent -- the worst performance since 2001, according to
market research firm IDC.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and five past and present
executives will testify with Fabrice Tourre, the banker at the
center of U.S. fraud allegations, at a Senate hearing next week. 
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Chief Risk Officer
Craig Broderick, former mortgage department head Daniel Sparks,
and current and former structured products group managing
directors Michael Swenson and Joshua Birnbaum were listed as
witnesses for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
hearing on April 27. The hearing will explore the role of
investment banks in the financial crisis, the panel said today
in an e-mail release. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
and Tourre, 31, last week, claiming they misled investors in a
collateralized debt obligation. Tourre and Blankfein agreed to
speak publicly to show Goldman Sachs has nothing to hide, people
with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Tourre plans to
tell the panel he did nothing wrong, one person said. 
Regulators claim that Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
firm in Wall Street history, misled investors by failing to
disclose that Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire
John Paulson, helped select loans for the CDO and then bet
against them. Goldman Sachs, which is contesting the SEC&#8217;s
claims, has said it &#8220;will take all necessary steps to defend
the firm.&#8221;

General Electric Co., the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, plans to introduce a 4
megawatt gearless wind turbine for offshore use in 2012 in a
challenge to market leader Siemens AG of Germany. 
Government incentives and pricing pressure for onshore
models amid the economic slowdown make the offshore market more
attractive, Mete Maltepe, global sales leader for wind energy at
GE, said in a telephone interview on April 20. 
Customer feedback on the offshore turbine has so far been
positive, Maltepe said. GE is using technology acquired in its
August takeover of the ScanWind unit of Morphic Technologies AB
in Sweden to take on Siemens and Vestas Wind Systems A/S of
Denmark. The purchase marked a change in tack for the U.S.
company, which has mostly focused on the onshore market. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good turbine, the direct drive is key,&#8221; Maltepe
said. In the onshore segment, &#8220;there are notable headwinds in
pricing. We are reducing costs and improving the performance.
There is pressure on margins and we&#8217;ll have to see if we can
hold them up.&#8221; 
GE, with a 12.4 percent share of the overall on- and
offshore wind turbine market by capacity, is head to head with
Vestas, which in 2009 held the top spot at 12.5 percent,
according to Danish consultants BTM Consult APS. 
Cheaper to Run 
Munich-based Siemens, with 5.9 percent of the overall
market and the top spot in offshore models, is installing as
many as 10 of its new gearless 3 megawatt turbines for both
offshore and onshore use this year, with large-scale production
planned to start in 2011. Vestas CEO Ditlev Engel on Feb. 10
declined to say if his company also plans to develop a gearless
turbine. 
Direct drive or gearless turbines reduce the number of
moving parts in a unit and increase reliability, helping
minimize costly open-sea maintenance. Such technology accounted
for about 14 percent of installed capacity last year, BTM said.
Offshore wind park operators include Germany&#8217;s Enercon GmbH and
Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co. of China. 
GE has an installed base of 13,500 wind turbines, and its
wind energy business posted sales of more than $6 billion in
2009. 
&#8220;We are getting into offshore to be among the leading
suppliers,&#8221; Malpete said, declining to provide a specific time
frame.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director
Rajat Gupta is suspected by U.S. investigators of tipping off a
hedge fund billionaire to a $5 billion investment in the bank by
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a person with direct
knowledge of the inquiry said. 
Gupta, 61, who has said he won&#8217;t stand for re-election to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board, told Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam
about Buffett&#8217;s plan before it was announced in September 2008,
the person said, declining to be identified because the inquiry
isn&#8217;t public. 
Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is fighting criminal
charges and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil claims
that he used inside information to trade shares of companies
including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In a March 22 letter to
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers, made public April 9, prosecutors said they
had an interest in his trading in Goldman Sachs stock in 2008.
Three days before the letter was sent, Goldman Sachs announced
Gupta was leaving its board. 
&#8220;Rajat has neither violated any law nor done anything else
improper,&#8221; his attorney, Gary Naftalis of Kramer, Levin,
Naftalis  Frankel LLP, said in a statement. &#8220;He has always
conducted himself with integrity in his business, philanthropic
and personal life.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson, SEC spokesman John
Nester and Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, declined to comment. 
Gupta hasn&#8217;t been formally accused of any wrongdoing. The
Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier today. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, agreed to sell $5 billion in preferred shares that paid
10 percent interest to Buffett, after the Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. bankruptcy and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s purchase of
Merrill Lynch  Co. 
Gupta was McKinsey&#8217;s worldwide chief from 1994 to 2003, and
a senior worldwide partner until 2007. He withdrew from the
consulting firm and joined the boards of American Airlines
parent AMR Corp., Procter  Gamble Co., Harman International
Industries Inc. Genpact Ltd., the business outsourcing company,
and Russia&#8217;s OAO Sberbank.

Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., sliced another $1
million off the asking price of his Chicago mansion. 
Going into its fourth year on the market, the Gold Coast
neighborhood property is now listed for $9.5 million, according
to the Web site of broker Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty.
It was previously listed for $10.5 million by Koenig  Strey
GMAC Real Estate. 
Dimon bought the house at 25 E. Banks St. in 2000 when he
headed Chicago-based Bank One Corp. The 15,000 square-foot
mansion has eight bedrooms, nine full bathrooms and was built in
the late 1800s. Dimon first listed it for sale in April 2007 for
$13.5 million. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a statement home,&#8221; said Jim Kinney, vice president
of luxury sales for Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in
Chicago. &#8220;It represents an attractive value in the
neighborhood.&#8221; 
The house, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has a
rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. 
Sluggish Market 
The problem is that demand for Chicago&#8217;s high-end homes is
&#8220;sluggish, sluggish, sluggish,&#8221; Kinney said, even though
overall sales in the nation&#8217;s third-largest city climbed 50
percent to 1,814 in March. 
The median price fell 4.6 percent to $209,000 from a year
earlier, the Illinois Association of Realtors said in a
statement yesterday. 
&#8220;While there has been some improvement in delinquencies
and home prices in some markets, we believe that significant
improvements will depend largely on an improving economy,&#8221;
Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. 
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. 
Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale of Bank One to JPMorgan
Chase in 2004. He and his wife Judith bought the Banks Street
property in 2000 for $4.7 million, according to records on the
Web site of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.

Honest Tea, partly owned by Coca-
Cola Co., may increase sales by at least 70 percent within a
year as it becomes available throughout the U.S., said Seth
Goldman, the tea maker&#8217;s co-founder and president. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the soda maker&#8217;s largest
bottler, and the majority of franchise distributors have
committed to the expansion, which includes some Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. locations, Goldman said today in an interview in Atlanta. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a ship leaving the port, now you&#8217;ve got a
turbo-charged engine,&#8221; Goldman said of the national
distribution. Honest Tea sold about 5 million cases last year,
for revenue of $47 million, he said. 
Coca-Cola bought a 40 percent stake in Bethesda, Maryland-
based Honest Tea in 2008 to tap into demand for healthier
beverages amid soft-drink volume sales declines. The company has
also invested in Innocent Drinks, a maker of fruit smoothies,
and coconut-water maker Zico Beverages LLC. 
Honest Tea, which produces U.S. Department of Agriculture-
certified organic teas, lemonades and children&#8217;s drinks, sold
the stake to get capital and access to the world&#8217;s largest
beverage distribution system. 
Coca-Cola bottlers distribute Honest Tea in the western and
northeastern U.S., and CVS Caremark Corp. recently agreed to
sell four flavors in its stores nationally, Goldman said. The
national expansion by Coca-Cola this year won&#8217;t include New York
and some Mid-Atlantic markets, where Honest Tea will keep its
existing independent distributors, he said. 
Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola,
said the company looks forward to supporting Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;work in
building the Honest Tea brand,&#8221; declining to elaborate.
Officials at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment. 
Coca-Cola helped finance a $1 million tea brewer at one of
its bottling plants to process Honest Tea, which steeps tea
leaves in hot water rather than mixing a manufactured powder,
Goldman said. 
Coca-Cola fell 43 cents to $53.88 at 4:07 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 5.5
percent this year.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Altana
AG won a jury verdict on the validity of their patent for the
heartburn drug Protonix. 
A federal jury in Newark, New Jersey, today rejected
arguments by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. that the patent covered an
obvious variation of earlier patented compounds in the same
family as Protonix. 
Teva and Sun conceded they infringed the patent, which left
the jury with only the question of whether the patent was issued
properly. Teva, in a statement, said it can make additional
invalidity arguments to U.S. District Judge Jose Linares and a
decision &#8220;independent of today&#8217;s jury verdict would be
sufficient to invalidate the patent.&#8221; 
Pfizer can now ask Linares to order Teva and Sun to stop
selling the drug until the patent expires in January. A second
trial would be held to determine what New York-based Pfizer
should be paid for profit lost since Teva and Sun began selling
cheaper versions of the drug two years ago. 
&#8220;If we are successful at the end of this process, we will
be seeking the full measure of our damages,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
spokesman for Pfizer, said in an interview. 
Reflux Disease 
Protonix, whose chemical name is pantoprazole sodium, is a
proton pump inhibitor that reduces the secretion of stomach
acids and is used to treat the effects of gastroesophageal
reflux disease, or GERD, which cases heartburn and chronic
ulcers in the esophagus. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, acquired Protonix
last year as part of its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth. 
Protonix sales reached $1.9 billion in 2007, and then fell
58 percent to $806 million in 2008, after Teva, based in Petah
Tikva, Israel, began selling its generic version. Mumbai-based
Sun entered the market in January 2008, a month after Teva. 
Not all of the generic sales went to those two companies.
Wyeth began selling Protonix under its chemical name as a so-
called authorized generic to challenge Teva and Sun sales. 
The patent, licensed to Wyeth, is owned by Altana&#8217;s
pharmaceutical business, which was bought by closely held
Nycomed Danmark ApS. AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec was the first
proton pump inhibitor. Others include AstraZeneca&#8217;s Nexium,
Novartis AG&#8217;s Prevacid and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Aciphex. 
Lawsuit Pending 
The U.S. and 16 states have a pending lawsuit claiming
Wyeth manipulated prices of the heartburn pill to increase
market share and defraud Medicare, the U.S. government health-
insurance program for the elderly. A judge in February denied
Pfizer&#8217;s request to dismiss the suit. 
Wholesale drug distributors also have sued Wyeth and
Altana, accusing them of misleading the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to obtain the patent and protect their monopoly
on Protonix. That case was put on hold until the patent case was
completed. 
The case is Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 04cv2355, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark).

Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s largest
brokerage, will probably close 120 additional U.S. offices to
eliminate overlapping locations in its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. 
U.S. outlets will shrink to around 750, the unit&#8217;s
president, Charles Johnston, said today in an interview at an
industry conference in New York. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney had
870 domestic locations as of March 31, down from 958 on June 30,
2009. The timing of some decisions will be driven by the
branches&#8217; leases, which are often 10-year terms, Johnston said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s overlap in just about every market in the country
between Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley offices,&#8221; Johnston
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no grand plan to dramatically shrink the
footprint, but there&#8217;s an awful lot of no-brainer decisions when
you do a deal like this.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global wealth-management unit reported
pretax income of $278 million for the first quarter, compared
with $119 million in same period a year earlier, before the
joint venture was completed. Chief Executive Officer James
Gorman, who led the unit before succeeding John Mack in January,
said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month that the
joint venture will play &#8220;an increasingly important role in our
growth and profitability.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster, Johnston
said. 
&#8216;Organic Growth&#8217; 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a large enough footprint in those
markets,&#8221; Johnston said. &#8220;We&#8217;d like it to be bigger, and
there&#8217;s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or you
can grow organically. There hasn&#8217;t been much that&#8217;s been
available to buy. We&#8217;ve talked about some deals, but we&#8217;re going
on the path of organic growth.&#8221; 
The unit had 18,140 advisers as of March 31 as turnover was
at &#8220;historic lows,&#8221; Johnston said. He said the number of
advisers will likely stay around 18,000 and revenue growth will
come from increases in adviser productivity. 
The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage&#8217;s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. Net new client assets in the unit
were $5.8 billion, the highest since the third quarter of 2008.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may be
better off cutting its losses instead of fighting what it terms
&#8220;unfounded&#8221; fraud claims, say professors of securities law who
have examined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
lawsuit against the bank. 
The most profitable firm in Wall Street history will
probably lose what is typically the first hurdle in court, a
motion to throw out the April 16 suit because it lacks legal
merit, the professors said in interviews this week. After that,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s risks will mount and its negotiating position
will weaken, they said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a very low probability that Goldman could get the
case dismissed,&#8221; said Thomas Hazen of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose books include a two-volume
treatise on broker-dealer law. &#8220;Every pretrial motion the SEC
wins, Goldman gets one step closer to losing.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is the first major Wall Street firm accused
by regulators of fraud connected to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market. The SEC&#8217;s allegation that Goldman Sachs
defrauded investors sparked a 13 percent, one-day decline in its
shares. The New York-based firm, led by Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, 55, said it will vigorously contest the claims.
It must weigh the risks of a drawn-out legal battle against the
benefits of a more immediate resolution.

Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.
fell after releasing earnings reports that showed a rebound in
technology spending by companies and online buying by consumers
is less robust than analysts had predicted. 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, said third-
quarter sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, missing the
most optimistic revenue estimates. Amazon.com, the biggest
online retailer, said operating income this quarter may be as
low as $220 million, compared with $322.2 million, the average
prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
While Microsoft and Amazon.com had rising sales and profit
last quarter, neither lived up to analysts&#8217; most bullish
predictions. Optimism rose last week after Intel Corp. forecast
record profit margins in 2010, indicating that a revival in
computer demand is gathering steam. Results from Apple Inc. and
Best Buy Co. this week reflected robust consumer purchasing. 
&#8220;With technology in general and Microsoft in particular,
you&#8217;re going to get this issue where it&#8217;s not good enough or
it&#8217;s already in the stock and it sells off a little bit,&#8221; said
Dave Stepherson, a fund manager at Hardesty Capital Management
in Baltimore. Hardesty manages $700 million in assets, including
Microsoft shares. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a lot of momentum in technology
stocks.&#8221; 
Shares Decline 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 3.6 percent
to $30.27 in extended trading after the report. The shares had
risen 6 cents to $31.39 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.
Amazon.com, based in Seattle, dropped 5.9 percent to $141.30
after closing at $150.09. 
Amazon stock traded in Germany fell 4.9 percent to $142.70
as of 10:09 a.m. in Frankfurt, while Microsoft declined 3.2
percent to $30.40 from yesterday&#8217;s Nasdaq closing price of
$31.39. 
Third-quarter net income at Microsoft rose 35 percent to
$4.01 billion, or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast
of 42 cents in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded
the $14.4 billion average in the survey, reflecting rising
demand for Windows 7, the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship
operating system. 
Still, investors were expecting more, Stepherson said. For
the second straight quarter, much of Microsoft&#8217;s strength came
from consumers, while business spending hasn&#8217;t rebounded with
vigor. Sales of Office and server software missed estimates at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG. 
Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear contracts, was
$12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was $12.8 billion,
according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jefferies  Co. 
The numbers suggest corporate customers are holding off on
big orders that stretch over many years. 
&#8216;Really Poor&#8217; 
&#8220;The deferred revenue was really poor,&#8221; said Brent Thill,
an analyst with UBS AG in San Francisco. &#8220;Microsoft is one of
the last companies in technology to say enterprise spending is
turning. Everyone thought they&#8217;d put up better growth.&#8221; 
Amazon.com said operating income will be $220 million to
$320 million, below the average estimate in the Bloomberg
survey. The company is struggling to extract favorable pricing
from its suppliers who, with improving demand, don&#8217;t have to
offer as many discounts, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Financial LP in New York. 
As more consumers snap up digital books and other media --
buying fewer of the physical products that have long been
Amazon.com&#8217;s mainstay -- the company faces increased competition
from rivals such as Apple, Gillis said. 
&#8220;Amazon is not likely to experience the same
profitability and leadership position in digital media that it
enjoys selling physical books, movies and music,&#8221; Gillis said. 
Earlier Gains 
First-quarter sales of $7.13 billion and profit of $299
million, or 66 cents a share, beat analysts&#8217; estimates. The
company&#8217;s shares have climbed 90 percent in the past year,
double the gain by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Amazon.com and Microsoft are not the only companies whose
quarterly earnings reports compared poorly to those of Intel and
Apple. Google Inc., the biggest seller of Internet advertising,
posted its biggest drop since December 2008 last week after
reporting profit that missed the highest analyst estimates.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The leading Internet stocks so far all reported fairly
good results and guidance and still saw their stocks drop,&#8221;
said Fred Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co. in Boca Raton,
Florida. &#8220;The stock market expectations for where technology
stocks should trade may have temporarily gotten ahead of
themselves.&#8221;

investment; investigators wrote to Gupta, who said last month
he was stepping down as a Goldman director, to say they had
found out about the tip through an intercepted phone call
between Gupta and Rajaratnam, the newspaper said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and U.S.
Senator Carl Levin fired opening shots ahead of a congressional
hearing this week, releasing conflicting evidence of the
investment bank&#8217;s tactics during the mortgage market&#8217;s collapse. 
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, posted internal Goldman Sachs e-
mails on his website yesterday that he said show the firm &#8220;made
a lot of money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Goldman
Sachs responded with documents indicating the firm lost money on
mortgages in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market
would fall. 
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
current and former Goldman Sachs employees will have to face
questions from Levin&#8217;s panel against the backdrop of fraud
claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
regulator sued the firm on April 16, saying it defrauded
investors when selling a debt instrument tied to mortgages. 
Goldman Sachs, which contests the SEC&#8217;s claims, said
Levin&#8217;s committee has &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; evidence and jumped to
conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
&#8220;Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not simply
market-makers, they were self-interested promoters of risky and
complicated financial schemes that helped trigger the crisis,&#8221;
Levin, 75, said in a statement released with the e-mails. 
One of the e-mails provided by Levin yesterday shows
Blankfein telling colleagues on Nov. 18, 2007, that the firm was
making more money from its so-called short bets on mortgages
than it lost on its investments related to home loans. 
&#8216;Mortgage Mess&#8217; 
&#8220;Of course we didn&#8217;t dodge the mortgage mess,&#8221; Blankfein
wrote in an e-mail dated Nov. 18, 2007, that was among eight
pages of documents made public by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &#8220;We lost money, then made more
than we lost because of shorts. Also, it&#8217;s not over, so who
knows how it will turn out ultimately.&#8221; 
Another document contains an exchange between Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s
president and chief operating officer, about the fixed-income
division&#8217;s profit and loss statement in July 2007. Cohn&#8217;s e-mail
describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage unit is up &#8220;in the index
book,&#8221; while recording writedowns on residential mortgages and
collateralized debt obligations. One method the firm used to
make bets against the mortgage market was to take short
positions on the so-called ABX index. 
&#8220;Tells you what might be happening to people who don&#8217;t
have the big short,&#8221; Viniar replies, according to the
documents. 
Losses Overwhelmed Gains 
Documents released yesterday by Goldman Sachs show that the
firm&#8217;s gains from shorting subprime mortgages in 2007 were
overwhelmed by losses in 2008 when higher-quality mortgages
suffered more than the firm anticipated. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs did not have access to any special
information that caused us to know that the U.S. housing market
would collapse,&#8221; the firm stated in an &#8220;executive summary&#8221; of
its arguments released yesterday. &#8220;As a result of the spread of
the crisis from subprime to all residential mortgages, Goldman
Sachs had overall net losses of approximately $1.7 billion with
respect to residential mortgage-related products for fiscal
2008.&#8221; 
A lawyer for Goldman Sachs wrote a letter to Levin April 23
asking the subcommittee to warn the firm of any information the
panel plans to release so it has a chance to respond. The letter
followed Levin&#8217;s statement at a hearing the same day that
&#8220;investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not market makers
helping clients; they were self-interested promoters of risky
and complicated financial schemes that were a major part of the
2008 crisis.&#8221; 
&#8216;Already Drawn Conclusions&#8217; 
&#8220;The statement suggests that you and the subcommittee have
already drawn conclusions about the conduct of Goldman Sachs,&#8221;
K. Lee Blalack II from the law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP wrote
to Levin. &#8220;We strongly disagree with your statement at today&#8217;s
hearing and believe that, if we were provided an opportunity to
respond to your specific findings, Goldman Sachs could produce
to you information that establishes that your findings are
incorrect.&#8221; 
Blalack, a partner in the Washington office of O&#8217;Melveny 
Myers, is a former chief counsel and staff director of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, according to his
biography on the firm&#8217;s website. 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Making Markets 
Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. 
&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; 
Pecora Commission 
The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre,
are accused of violating in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s suit filed on April 16. 
The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. 
Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell Levin&#8217;s panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. 
SEC Enforcement Chief 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Wall Street Journal reported April 23, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear
whether Khuzami reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related
to CDOs, the newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because
the terms of his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing
Deutsche Bank, John Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg
News. 
Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings may have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. 
Tougher Questioning 
Blankfein may get tougher questioning than he received in
front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by former
California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January, Geisst
said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. 
&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; 
Levin has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. 
&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; 
Blum said the permanent subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels in which senators and their staffs cooperate across
party lines. 
Parade of Critics 
Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; 
Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. 
A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. 
Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at the
permanent subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. 
Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. 
Budget Watchdog 
Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; 
Created in 1948, the panel was led in the 1950s by then-
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who alleged that
communists had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy
later was censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003
&#8220;destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the
infiltration of our government.&#8221; 
In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. 
Enron, Saddam Hussein 
Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. 
The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. 
The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221;

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, the
largest Italian insurer, named Cesare Geronzi, the outgoing
chairman of its largest shareholder, Mediobanca SpA, as its new
chairman and Giovanni Perissinotto as its sole Chief Executive. 
Geronzi, 75, replaces 85-year-old Antoine Bernheim, who was
named honorary president at Generali&#8217;s annual meeting yesterday
in Trieste, Italy. Perissinotto&#8217;s former co-CEO, Sergio
Balbinot, now will lead the company&#8217;s international insurance
units. 
&#8220;We expect the effect of the Geronzi&#8217;s appointment to be
negative for the shares,&#8221; Fabrizio Croce, a Zurich-based
analyst with Kepler Capital Markets SA with a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on
the stock, wrote in a note April 23. &#8220;Investment funds, Anglo-
Saxon investors and ethical funds could have a potential issue
with the appointment and may reduce their positions.&#8221; 
Some investors are concerned with the influence Milan-based
Mediobanca, Italy&#8217;s biggest investment bank, has over the
insurer. Geronzi yesterday said Generali doesn&#8217;t plan a capital
increase, which might dilute Mediobanca&#8217;s 14 percent stake. He
also ruled out a merger with Mediobanca. 
Still, the decision to make Perissinotto, 56, the company&#8217;s
single chief executive &#8220;will satisfy investors worried by
Mediobanca&#8217;s strength on the board,&#8221; Edoardo Liuni an analyst
at NuovoMercato.it said in a phone interview after the
appointments. &#8220;Perissinotto will ensure independent leadership
at the insurer.&#8221; 
&#8216;Punished&#8217; 
Bernheim, who was chairman for eight years, said he
regretted Mediobanca&#8217;s decision to replace him. 
&#8220;Sometimes when you work well, you are punished,&#8221; said
Bernheim, who has spent almost four decades with the company.
&#8220;This is an example.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t elaborate the comment. 
Geronzi, speaking at a press conference after the annual
meeting, said that Bernheim&#8217;s words were understandable given
his long tenure at the insurer. &#8220;I appreciate Bernheim, as
witnessed by his appointment as honorary president,&#8221; he said. 
Bernheim was moved to tears several times during his one-
and-a-half hour speech that was translated from French. He said
he wished &#8220;all the best&#8221; to the new management. 
Geronzi was reinstated as chairman of Mediobanca by
investors in 2007 after a conviction in connection with the
bankruptcy of property and tourism company Italcase. He was
acquitted of the charges in 2009 on appeal. Geronzi, who won&#8217;t
have an executive role at Generali, was also formerly a Bank of
Italy official and chairman of Rome-based Capitalia SpA. 
Nagel, Caltagirone, Bollore 
Generali appointed non-executive deputy chairmen at the
annual meeting: Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel; Francesco Gaetano
Caltagirone, the chairman of publishing and media company
Caltagirone Editore Spa; and French billionaire Vincent Bollore. 
Enel SpA CEO Paolo Scaroni, Banco Espanol de Credito SA
Chairwoman Ana Patricia Botin, Tod&#8217;s SpA Chairman Diego della
Valle, and De Agostini SpA CEO Lorenzo Pellicioli also were
named board members. 
Generali said first-quarter gross premiums rose 16 percent,
boosted by its life-insurance business and a recovery of Italian
operations. 
Total premiums increased to 20.8 billion euros ($27.8
billion) in the first three months of 2010 from the year
earlier, Perissinotto said. Italian premiums rose 22 percent to
5.4 billion euros because of a 34 percent increase in life-
insurance business. 
&#8220;We have seen positive elements in the first quarter,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We hope for a consolidation of the economic recovery
that would allow us to increase our profitability.&#8221; 
Greece, Spain, Ireland 
Generali has declined 11 percent this year, compared with
the 2.2 percent increase in the Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance
Index. The company has a market value of 26 billion euros. 
Generali has 900 million euros of &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece,
Spain, Portugal and Ireland, the company said yesterday. 
Generali, which will release its first-quarter results on
May 12, is expanding in emerging markets, including China and
the Middle East, as it recovers from the economic crisis.
Perissinotto said that the external growth is a priority for
Generali. 
The insurer wants to increase its business in Russia, where
it owns a 38.5 percent holding in Ingosstrakh. Perissinotto said
he aims to resume talks with Oleg Deripaska, who owns the
remainder, about raising the stake. 
Generali doesn&#8217;t plan to boost its stake in Banco Santander
SA, Perissinotto said.

Wall Street&#8217;s smartest will meet
the Senate&#8217;s toughest at a hearing next week that could provide
a seminal moment in the reckoning after the financial crisis. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, and six current and former employees of
his firm will face a grilling from the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Led by Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has
served in the U.S. Senate for more than 30 years, the panel has
a reputation for thorough research. 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. It comes after
regulators sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre,
alleging fraud in the sale of a mortgage-linked investment as
the market for such investments turned, accusations the firm
denies. 
&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; 
The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and Tourre are accused of
violating in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit filed
on April 16. 
SEC Accusations 
The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. 
Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell the panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. 
Levin today released Goldman Sachs e-mails obtained by his
committee that he said demonstrate the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Among them was
an e-mail in which Blankfein said, &#8220;We lost money, then made
more than we lost because of shorts.&#8221; 
&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
today released information on the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
profits and losses in 2007 and 2008. The information shows
Goldman Sachs had net losses of $1.2 billion in residential
mortgage-related products in the period. While the firm
generated more money than it lost on mortgage positions in 2007,
losses overwhelmed gains in the first quarter of 2008, the
documents show. 
&#8220;The U.S. Senate subcommittee has cherry-picked just four
e-mails from the almost 20 million pages of documents and e-
mails provided to it by Goldman Sachs,&#8221; van Praag said. &#8220;It is
concerning that the subcommittee seems to have reached its
conclusion even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
Implications for Regulation 
Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings could have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. 
Blankfein, 55, may get tougher questioning than he received
in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by
former California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January,
Geisst said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. 
&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; 
Levin, 75, has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. 
Homework Done 
&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; 
Blum said the Permanent Subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels with bipartisan cooperation between the senators and
their staffs. 
Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; 
Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. 
A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. 
&#8216;Lose-Lose&#8217; 
The hearing presents a &#8220;lose-lose situation&#8221; for Goldman
Sachs, Geisst said, because the firm is fighting a battle over
its reputation as well as the law. 
&#8220;If they answer with generalities and maintain that they
haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, then it just gets worse for them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If they do admit that they&#8217;ve actually done something
wrong, specifically, it won&#8217;t go well for them.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Making Markets 
Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; 
&#8220;Some of these things Goldman did had no useful
function,&#8221; said Richard Sylla, a financial historian and
economics professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of
Business. &#8220;They have that problem even if they didn&#8217;t do
anything illegal.&#8221; 
Five Goldman Sachs senior executives sold $65.4 million of
stock after the firm received notice of possible fraud
allegations last year from the SEC, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment on the sales when contacted by Bloomberg
News. The firm has said it didn&#8217;t disclose receiving a Wells
notice from the SEC because it didn&#8217;t think it was material. 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Journal reported yesterday, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear whether Khuzami
reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related to CDOs, the
newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because the terms of
his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing Deutsche Bank, John
Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg News. 
Roach, Ashdown 
Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at
Permanent Subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. 
Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. 
Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; 
McCarthy Censure 
Created in 1948, the panel was led by then-Senator Joseph
McCarthy of Wisconsin in the 1950s, who alleged that communists
had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy later was
censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003 &#8220;destroyed
careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of
our government.&#8221; 
In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. 
Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. 
Focus on Taxes 
The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. 
The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221;

White House officials and Democratic
lawmakers, bracing for a Senate showdown on Wall Street
oversight, seized on internal e-mails from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to push for new curbs that would include a ban on
proprietary trading. 
&#8220;These e-mails signify that there are all kinds of
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that Wall Street is
working for its clients and working against its clients in the
same sort of bundled toxic securities,&#8221; Senator Sherrod Brown,
a Democrat from Ohio, said today on ABC&#8217;s This Week. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why we need really strong reform that will separate the
proprietary trading from banking functions.&#8221; 
The e-mails show that the New York-based firm &#8220;made a lot
of money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; said Carl
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations and published the e-mails
yesterday. Democrats are using the revelations to bolster
support for Senator Christopher Dodd&#8217;s financial overhaul, which
faces a test vote in the Senate tomorrow. At least one
Republican vote is needed to open debate. 
A ban on proprietary trading, named the Volcker rule after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who&#8217;s advising the
President Barack Obama, is &#8220;highly relevant&#8221; to ending
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, Austan Goolsbee, a White
House economic adviser, said today on ABC&#8217;s program &#8220;This
Week.&#8221; 
Blankfein at Hearing 
Levin&#8217;s panel is scheduled to question Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six other current and former
Goldman Sachs employees on Tuesday. The firm is battling an
April 16 fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors in
a collateralized debt obligation about the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. in assembling the deal and its intention to
bet against the CDO. 
Goldman Sachs has called the SEC suit &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; The firm responded to Levin&#8217;s publication of the e-
mails with documents indicating the firm lost money on mortgages
in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market would fall. 
&#8220;The CEO of Goldman Sachs is not going to win any
popularity contests, when over a period that ordinary Americans&#8217;
pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were
actually making significant money off of it,&#8221; Goolsbee said. 
The SEC&#8217;s case and the e-mails heighten the need to pass
regulatory reform, Dodd, who chairs the Senate Banking
Committee, said today in an interview on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the
Press.&#8221; Dodd has been working with Richard Shelby, the top
Republican on the committee, since last year to try to broker a
compromise on the legislation. 
Shelby and Dodd 
Shelby, also speaking on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;, said that
while he and Dodd are &#8220;conceptually very, very close&#8221; on the
legislation, he doubts they will reach an agreement by tomorrow.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to end, once and for all, the casino atmosphere on
Wall Street,&#8221; he said. 
Larry Summers, the director of the White House National
Economic Council, said the e-mails underscore &#8220;what is at the
center&#8221; of Obama&#8217;s plan for overhauling financial regulation.
That includes &#8220;the importance of things being in the open,&#8221;
and of knowing &#8220;who&#8217;s got a stake in success, who&#8217;s got a stake
in failure,&#8221; Summers said on the CBS program &#8220;Face The
Nation.&#8221; 
Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and member of
the Senate Banking Committee who helped write parts of the bill,
said the e-mails &#8220;certainly do not read well.&#8221; 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
&#8220;I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed
in the e-mails, but I think we&#8217;re better off waiting to see
exactly what has taken place,&#8221; Corker said. &#8220;There are some
conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked
at, but I&#8217;d rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds
before making any judgments.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a really uncomfortable week, a
challenging week, for CEO Lloyd Blankfein,&#8221; Jon Corzine, the
former Democratic New Jersey governor and senator who ran
Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, said in an interview broadcast
today on ABC News&#8217;s Good Morning America. &#8220;The silver lining is
this is going to reinforce the need for moving forward with
financial regulatory reform.&#8221;

Hunt</headline><body>
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose
exceptional cachet and clout have been enhanced by its role in
public policy, suddenly is a pariah in government and political
circles. 
Let&#8217;s assume, for a moment, that the company prevails in
the fraud suit brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, that no one was misled about the content of the
product it sold, only about the background. 
Also assume that, as Goldman Sachs executives insisted
last week, most of their customers are supportive of the firm,
and any short-term losses will be negligible. 
Still, the Goldman Sachs brand, one of the most
prestigious in the world, corporate or otherwise, is tarnished,
perhaps indelibly. If the company believes it can tough its way
through this, it&#8217;s as insular as critics charge. 
For starters, the fraud suit, which Goldman Sachs says is
without merit, may not be the only problem facing the company.
The Germans and British are already piling on, and reportedly
Goldman Sachs is nervous about the full-scale inquiry into the
Wall Street fiasco by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Getting in the cross hairs of the panel&#8217;s
Democratic chairman, Michigan&#8217;s Carl Levin, one of the
toughest, straightest shooters in Congress, is cause for
concern. 
Stellar Values 
For context, professionally I&#8217;ve known a half-dozen top
former Goldman Sachs executives; they&#8217;re all able and
thoughtful. The one I know well has stellar values. 
Also, despite working for two of the great financial news
organizations in the world for more than four decades, I&#8217;ve
never covered Wall Street; I cover politics, a proud
journalistic hack. 
In this case, the prism of politics is illuminating. The
global Goldman Sachs mystique has been enhanced by the number
of executives tapped for leading government jobs. Treasury
Secretaries Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and
Henry Paulson in the George W. Bush administration were former
Goldman Sachs chairmen, as was Stephen Friedman, the top White
House economic adviser during the Bush presidency. There is a
plethora of Goldman alums sprinkled throughout the Obama
administration. 
Until recently there was no better credential for
government service than a Goldman Sachs background; now the G
is more like the forbidden A in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;The
Scarlet Letter.&#8221; 
Lethal Background 
If there were an opening today for a Federal Reserve
governor or a deputy Treasury secretary or for a prominent
White House economic role, a Goldman Sachs background,
administration officials privately admit, would be lethal. 
&#8220;Clearly, they&#8217;ve become a toxic asset,&#8221; says Simon Johnson, a former International Monetary Fund economist who is
now a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management. 
The fraud charges were the final straw in the building
resentment against Goldman Sachs; synthetic collateralized debt
obligations aren&#8217;t the stuff of backyard barbecue chatter or
debates at a bar. The public and political resentment, as one
crisis manager put it, grows out of the sense that Goldman
Sachs not only hasn&#8217;t &#8220;shared the pain&#8221; experienced by the
rest of America, but has &#8220;profited from it.&#8221; (Goldman Sachs,
which reported record profit last week, did take a government
handout in 2008 and repaid it in full with interest). 
Political Giving 
In this environment, a firm&#8217;s political standing
dissipates. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s political-action committee gave
$290,500 to congressional candidates last month as the
legislature weighed the financial-regulation overhaul.
President Barack Obama shook the Goldman Sachs money tree for
almost $1 million in the last presidential campaign. 
There is now a bipartisan scramble to strike distance from
the Wall Street powerhouse. Mark Kirk, Republican candidate for
an Illinois U.S. Senate seat, says he&#8217;ll refund any
contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. His Democratic
opponents say that isn&#8217;t sufficient. 
In the Arkansas Senate Democratic primary, Lieutenant
Governor Bill Halter assailed incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln
for getting money from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s PAC. Lincoln just
canceled a plan to hold a fundraising lunch at Goldman. In the
California gubernatorial race, opponents are assailing former
EBay Inc. (EBAY) Chairwoman Meg Whitman for being an ex-Goldman Sachs
director. The Whitman camp&#8217;s response: Her critics have Goldman
ties, too. 
Keeping the Money 
Although Obama may be capitalizing on the anti-Wall Street
wave with his regulatory overhaul bill, Republicans such as
South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint are demanding he give back
the big bucks he got from Goldman Sachs in the last campaign;
he won&#8217;t. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the guest of
honor at a private Park Avenue cocktails soiree for wealthy
Obama supporters last weekend, surely wasn&#8217;t pleased it was
reported that a Goldman Sachs partner was present. 
Whatever the legalities of the fraud charge, it looks
awful, more like the doings in a Las Vegas casino than on Wall
Street, and more like Gordon Gekko greed than the legitimate
economic interest to hedge against risk. Goldman Sachs contends
the SEC&#8217;s case boils down to the actions of Fabrice Tourre,
then a 28-year-old vice president, who while putting together
the multibillion-dollar deal was writing e-mails, according to
the SEC, exclaiming that the &#8220;whole building is about to
collapse,&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;surreal&#8221; that no one understands
these instruments. 
If he was the culprit, who was the enabler? 
Goldman Scapegoat 
With no inside knowledge, but based on years of watching
politicians and political institutions respond to such crises,
there are two certainties about what&#8217;s going on in the
corporate suites of Goldman Sachs. There is likely near-
universal consensus that much of this is unfair and the company
is being made a scapegoat by pandering politicians. 
The established order says we&#8217;re going to fight this with
all our considerable resources, while continuing to flourish
financially because we&#8217;re better. 
Deeper, however, there is another, more profound debate.
Others, perhaps privately, realize this is a fantasy. If there
is a way to settle the fraud case without risking huge
financial exposure, it has to be considered. Someone with Paul Volcker-like credibility has to be enlisted to review the
company&#8217;s culture and practices; contrition and change at the
top are unavoidable.

Newly disclosed Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. internal e-mails cast light on how the investment bank
devised collateralized debt obligations called Abacus, including
one at the center of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud lawsuit. 
The e-mails show employees discussed which outside firms
would be &#8220;easiest&#8221; to work with while creating Abacus CDOs to
bet against the housing market. 
The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin,
the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, as the panel prepares to
question Goldman Sachs executives today. In one message, a
Goldman Sachs worker asked which outside firm would most likely
approve assets that hedge fund Paulson  Co. wanted to include
in a CDO and bet against. 
&#8220;The way I look at it, the easiest manager to work with
should be used for our own axes,&#8221; the author wrote in December
2006, using industry jargon that can refer to the firm&#8217;s 
financial interest in a deal. The writer also expressed concern 
that two firms being considered weren&#8217;t likely to sign off on 
Paulson&#8217;s suggested assets. &#8220;They will never agree to the type 
of names [P]aulson want to use[.]&#8221; 
The Senate committee&#8217;s investigators have pored through
about 2 million Goldman Sachs documents as lawmakers prepare to
question Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
other current and former employees. They include Fabrice Tourre,
the banker at the center of the SEC&#8217;s complaint. 
&#8216;Be Sensitive&#8217; 
In one e-mail, Tourre emphasized the firm should focus on
serving Paulson to reap greater profits. 
&#8220;We need to be sensitive of the profitability of these
trades vs. profitability of abacus,&#8221; Tourre wrote in one e-
mail, according to a copy released by Levin. &#8220;We should
prioritize the higher profit margin businesses with Paulson.&#8221; 
The e-mail about picking the easiest manager was part of an
exchange with Tourre, according to a list of exhibits released
by the lawmaker. The author wasn&#8217;t identified. 
In another December 2006 e-mail, Tourre discussed other
business opportunities for Abacus, outlining a strategy in which
Goldman Sachs would &#8220;&#8216;rent&#8217; our Abacus platform to
counterparties&#8221; that wanted to short the market. 
The messages show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its own
interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221;
Levin said. While his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for
determining whether there was any criminal activity, it will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the
SEC or the Justice Department. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, claiming the New
York-based bank misled investors in a CDO about the role Paulson
played in assembling the deal and the fund&#8217;s intent to bet that
its underlying assets would lose value. The hedge fund, run by
billionaire investor John Paulson, wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs is fighting the SEC&#8217;s claims, which it says
are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; In prepared testimony for
today&#8217;s hearing, Blankfein said the firm didn&#8217;t bet against
clients and didn&#8217;t &#8220;make a massive short&#8221; against the housing
market.

The cost to protect the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and two other derivatives dealers jumped for the fourth day as
the U.S. Senate considers a bill that may curb their trading
revenue. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs, the bank facing
fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, jumped to the highest in almost a year. Contracts on
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit reached
the highest since August, and JPMorgan swaps climbed the most in
more than 11 weeks. 
The legislation would damp one of Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable businesses, in which Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of
America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. earned an estimated
$28 billion in revenue last year, according to filings with the
Federal Reserve and people familiar with their income sources. 
The Senate was set to hold a test vote today on legislation
that would force the most actively traded derivatives to
exchanges or trading platforms that resemble exchanges, mandate
banks to hold more capital on other derivatives trades and
require commercial banks to wall off swaps trading desks. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re talking about a pretty significant contributor to
earnings,&#8221; said Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service in New York. &#8220;If they lost a material portion
of that, it obviously wouldn&#8217;t be good. The problem with
exchange trading for dealers is that they would be giving up
profits without a concomitant decrease in risk to compensate for
it.&#8221; 
Test Vote 
Senator Richard Shelby, a lead negotiator on the financial-
reform bill, said Republicans will block Democrats&#8217; efforts to
begin debate on the measure in a test vote today. 
The derivatives provisions are part of a broader financial-
regulation bill intended to prevent a repeat of the credit
crisis that led to the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
the near collapse of Bear Stearns Cos. and the government
bailout of insurer American International Group. 
The legislation includes measures empowering federal
agencies to dissolve failed systemically important financial
firms to prevent their collapse from disrupting the economy. 
JPMorgan alone could lose as much as $3 billion a year in
revenue if it doesn&#8217;t combat the move of derivatives trades to
exchanges, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a March 15 report. 
&#8220;The banking system is on a journey to being much more
utility-like,&#8221; Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive officer at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said today at the Milken
Global Institute conference in Los Angeles. &#8220;What&#8217;s likely to
happen over the next few months is much more emphasis on
stability and less emphasis on efficiency and innovation.&#8221; 
Hearing Tomorrow 
Five-year credit-default swaps on Goldman jumped 23 basis
points to 167 basis points as of 4:35 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. That&#8217;s the highest
since May 2009, CMA DataVision prices show. 
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is set
to question Goldman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former employees of the firm
tomorrow. The SEC says Goldman Sachs and executive director
Fabrice Tourre misled investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation about the role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co.,
which bet the CDO would collapse. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the panel, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. 
Goldman swaps have jumped 76 basis points since April 15,
the day before the SEC announced its fraud suit. 
Swaps on JPMorgan climbed 17 basis points to a mid-price of
89.5 basis points, the most since Feb. 4, CMA prices show.
Morgan Stanley swaps jumped 34 to 184.5. Contracts on Merrill
rose 37 to 193 and Bank of America swaps increased 37 to 162,
CMA prices show. 
Markit CDX Index 
Swaps on Citigroup Inc. rose 21 basis points to a mid-price
of 183, Phoenix prices show. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk rose to
the highest in two months. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index Series 14, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 2.2 basis points to a mid-price of 91
basis points as of 5:23 p.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by shareholders over a collateralized-debt obligation known as
Abacus 2007-AC1 that prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit this month. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the truth about Abacus or the
bank&#8217;s financial condition, investors said in the complaint
filed today in federal court in Manhattan. &#8220;As news of
Goldman&#8217;s misconduct reached the market, Goldman stock
immediately plummeted,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
When the SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, its shares
fell 13 percent to close at $160.70. That case centers on
whether the New York-based firm should have told investors that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying securities in
the CDO -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. 
&#8220;Defendants omitted and/or misrepresented material facts
concerning Goldman&#8217;s participation in structuring the CDO to
help one client who was short the CDO while simultaneously
selling the CDO to another client,&#8221; investors said in today&#8217;s
complaint. 
Investor Ilene Richman filed the lawsuit on behalf of
others who bought Goldman Sachs shares from Oct. 15 to April 16. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment today. 
The securities-fraud suit, filed by San Diego-based law
firm Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP, also names as defendants
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar and President Gary D. Cohn. 
SEC Investigation 
The bank concealed from investors that it was being
investigated by the SEC over the CDO late last year, at the same
time it launched a public-relations campaign touting its
&#8220;responsible business practices&#8221; to combat negative publicity
over $16 billion in bonuses it was scheduled to pay employees,
according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the SEC probe in its third-
quarter filing with the commission on Nov. 4, according to the
complaint. 
On April 22, two investors separately sued Goldman Sachs
officers and directors, including Blankfein, on behalf of the
bank in state court in Manhattan for permitting the company to
enter into a series of CDOs, including Abacus 2007-AC1, tied to
the subprime market. Another so-called derivative lawsuit was
filed against the officers and directors today in federal court
in Manhattan. 
Goldman Sachs fell $5.37, or 3.4 percent, to $152.03 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The case is Richman v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 10-03461,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, made an
estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against
mortgage-linked securities, including some it created, a U.S.
senator said today. 
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released e-mails and
other documents that he said show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its
own interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients.&#8221; 
The documents precede a showdown on Capitol Hill tomorrow
between Levin&#8217;s panel and seven current and former Goldman Sachs
employees. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and
Fabrice Tourre, 31, an executive director who was named in the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud lawsuit
against the firm, are among Goldman employees set to answer
questions. 
&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and we
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said at a briefing for reporters
today on tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. &#8220;We think there are a number of
banks engaged in similar conduct but we had to focus on one.&#8221; 
The subcommittee estimated that Goldman Sachs generated
$3.7 billion from its short bets on a declining mortgage market
in 2007, Levin said. The figure doesn&#8217;t take into account losses
they suffered on mortgage-related securities they held, he said. 
SEC, Justice Department 
Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether there was any criminal activity, although he said the
panel will decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter
to the SEC or the Justice Department. 
Blankfein will tell the committee tomorrow that the firm
didn&#8217;t wager against clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against
the housing market, according to the prepared text of his
remarks. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will say, according to the text. 
While the firm disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;We have to do a better job of striking
the balance between what an informed client believes is
important to his or her investing goals and what the public
believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; 
Among the evidence Levin presented today was an internal e-
mail about a March 2007 presentation to the board of directors
that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk started
the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB- rated
mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; 
An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Daniel Sparks, who
ran the mortgage business at the time and is among those
scheduled to testify, includes the comment &#8220;real bad feeling
across European sales about some of the trades we did with
clients. The damage this has done to our franchise is very
significant. Aggregate loss of our clients on just these 5
trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; 
Michael Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
structured products group who is also to appear tomorrow,
boasted in his 2007 performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to
clients who demanded that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program
as clients tried to gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring
to the name for Goldman&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those
were unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of
millions of dollars.&#8221; 
Ties That Bind 
In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from institutional clients. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
&#8216;Incalculable Harm&#8217; 
&#8220;In a number of ways they contributed to the collapse of
this economy,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman Sachs and
others helped inject into our financial system has done
incalculable harm.&#8221; 
While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package that is set to be considered by the Senate
this week, he said he thinks it could be strengthened. He has
proposed an amendment that would help resolve the conflicts of
interest among Wall Street firms that he said are embodied in
the documents. He also endorsed banning financial firms from
engaging in so-called naked credit default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the credit. 
After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
website on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. 
$68 Million Bonus 
Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a debt instrument tied to
mortgages by failing to inform them of the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. The company said on April 24 that Levin&#8217;s
committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence it released and jumped
to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Pecora Era 
While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. 
&#8220;Looking at this crisis, it&#8217;s hard not to agree with the
conclusion of another congressional committee, which found &#8216;the
result of the unregulated activities of the investment bankers
were enormous,&#8217;&#8221; Levin said in the briefing with journalists.
&#8220;That conclusion came in 1934, when the Senate looked into the
reasons for the Great Depression.&#8221;

Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, will tell a
Senate committee tomorrow that the firm didn&#8217;t wager against
clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against the housing market. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
according to a prepared text of his remarks. 
Blankfein and six other current and former Goldman Sachs
executives will testify in front of the panel about their
practices in the mortgage-securities market leading up to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The firm
faces a fraud lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange
Commission that accuses it of failing to inform investors about
the role played by a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., in the deal. 
&#8220;As you know, ten days ago, the SEC announced a civil
action against Goldman Sachs in connection with a specific
transaction,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the text of his
remarks. &#8220;It was one of the worst days in my professional life,
as I know it was for every person at our firm.&#8221; 
Blankfein will say that New York-based Goldman Sachs has
been a &#8220;client-centered firm for 140 years and if our clients
believe that we don&#8217;t deserve their trust, we cannot survive.&#8221; 
&#8216;Complicated Transaction&#8217; 
While the firm says it disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
&#8220;I also recognize how such a complicated transaction may look
to many people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do
a better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
Blankfein will also say that the firm favors more
transparency for the public and regulators and is supporting the
creation of clearinghouses for eligible derivatives. He also
said the firm recognizes that many in the U.S. are skeptical
about investment banks. 
&#8220;What we and other banks, rating agencies and regulators
failed to do was sound the alarm that there was too much lending
and too much leverage in the system -- that credit had become
too cheap,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the remarks.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, said a bankruptcy court hearing
on its auction process will be delayed five days to give the
company time to consider competing investment plans. 
Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. are each leading groups that want to back General Growth,
which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the
past year. The hearing was postponed to May 4 from April 29,
Chicago-based General Growth said today in a statement. 
The delay will allow General Growth to speak with its
investor committees and &#8220;other parties concerning the full
range of offers, proposals and commitments received and complete
its assessment thereof,&#8221; the company said. 
Simon, spurned in February when it offered to buy General
Growth outright for $10 billion, earlier this month said it
would match the terms of a bankruptcy-exit proposal led by
Brookfield. Each plan would keep General Growth an independent
company, and would need bankruptcy court approval. Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, has said it is still interested in a
full takeover of its rival. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., seeking
to reduce assets tied to the declining U.S. housing market,
urged its sales force in 2006 and 2007 to sell those products to
clients, newly disclosed internal e-mails show. 
The e-mails, including communications from Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, show that employees discussed how to
&#8220;arm&#8221; salespeople to shed bonds the firm found too risky to
hold. The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin
in connection with a hearing where current and former managers
testified about the firm&#8217;s role in the financial crisis. 
Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, grilled the executives
about the firm&#8217;s bets against the housing market and its
disclosure to clients. 
In one of the e-mails, Blankfein asked whether employees
were doing enough to sell bonds backed by home loans including
subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;Could/should we have cleaned up these books before and
are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs in other
books throughout the division,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, wrote in an e-
mail dated Feb. 11, 2007. 
Questioned about the e-mail at yesterday&#8217;s hearing,
Blankfein told senators that his comment didn&#8217;t represent an
opinion of the bonds. 
&#8220;When I use the expression &#8216;cats and dogs&#8217; I mean
miscellaneous stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is part of my normal
point about aged inventory. Part of the discipline of our
business is to manage risk and sell inventory.&#8221; 
Clients&#8217; Questions 
The e-mails show that as early as the fall of 2006 clients
were questioning products tied to the mortgage market. On Oct.
19, 2006, Mitchell Resnick sent an e-mail to two colleagues
asking whether the firm had material about &#8220;how great&#8221; BBB
bonds tied to home loans were. BBB is a credit rating from
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings that indicates an
asset is two levels above junk. 
&#8220;A common response I am hearing&#8221; from potential investors
is &#8220;a concern about the housing market and BBB in particular,&#8221;
Resnick wrote. &#8220;We need to arm sales with a bit more. Do we
have anything?&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar convened
a meeting of mortgage traders and risk managers on Dec. 14,
2006, according to a document prepared by the firm that the
Senate panel released yesterday. 
&#8216;Net Long&#8217; 
At the time, Goldman Sachs had a &#8220;net long exposure&#8221; to
the subprime-mortgage market, meaning the bank was betting the
market would continue to rise. At the meeting, executives agreed
that the firm should &#8220;reduce its overall exposure to the
subprime mortgage market,&#8221; the document said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Stacey Bash-Polley sent an e-mail to
colleagues six days later with the subject line &#8220;Mezz Risk,&#8221; a
reference to lower tranches of collateralized debt obligations
linked to mortgages. Investors in mezzanine tranches are among
the first to lose money when the asset starts souring. 
&#8220;We have been thinking collectively about how to help
people move some of the risk,&#8221; wrote Bash-Polley, an executive
in the Goldman Sachs division that sold bonds. &#8220;We need to make
sure we arm&#8221; salespeople &#8220;with our pricing and have them focus
on the more difficult positions.&#8221; 
Targeting Clients 
In targeting clients, Bash-Polley wrote that Goldman Sachs
should focus on those that &#8220;can possibly do larger size at a
level that would be attractive when you take into consideration
the size of risk we could move.&#8221; 
&#8220;Makes sense to me,&#8221; responded Kevin Gasvoda, a Goldman
Sachs colleague. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson declined to comment
on the e-mails. 
The Senate hearing comes less than two weeks after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm and employee
Fabrice Tourre, 31, on claims they withheld material information
from investors in a CDO. Goldman Sachs said it will vigorously
contest the case, and Tourre told the senators yesterday, &#8220;I
deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations.&#8221; 
Levin said at the hearing that Goldman Sachs &#8220;profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it didn&#8217;t want to succeed, and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
the customers it had pledged to serve.&#8221; 
Making Money 
In a Sept. 26, 2007, e-mail released by the committee, Peter
Kraus, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s then co-head of investment management,
told Blankfein that some clients were expressing concern that
the firm was making money for itself but not its customers. 
Goldman Sachs had reported six days earlier that third-
quarter net income rose 79 percent to $2.85 billion after the
bank bet against mortgage bonds. Kraus told Blankfein he had met
with more than 10 clients and &#8220;individual prospects&#8221; since the
earnings announcement. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur good at making money for urself but
not us,&#8221; wrote Kraus, who left Goldman Sachs in September 2008
after working at the company for 22 years. 
&#8220;The individuals do sometimes, but while it requires the
utmost humility from us in response, I feel very strongly it
binds clients even closer to the firm. The alternative of take
ur money to a firm who is an under performer and not the best,
just isn&#8217;t reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association
with the best is good for them in the long run,&#8221; he wrote.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Senate panel that
market-makers have no obligation to tell clients about their own
position in a security. 
Blankfein, responding to questions from Senator Carl Levin,
chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said
the nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; 
The Senate panel, winding up a probe of Goldman Sachs that
has lasted more than a year, used today&#8217;s hearing to pepper
current and former executives with questions about their duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market as
the bank also sold mortgage-linked securities to customers. 
Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees testified
about the mortgage-securities business in the years leading to
the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, was sued for fraud earlier this month by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company contests the
claim. 
Blankfein said people on Wall Street weren&#8217;t certain that
housing prices would drop before the financial crisis began. 
&#8220;I think we&#8217;re not that smart,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Even the
people who in hindsight knew it, I think they thought it, and
then it turned out they were right. I can tell you for my own
self, at 20 percent down in the housing market, I didn&#8217;t know
whether it would go down 30 percent or rebound up 10 percent.&#8221;

at least one thing during his testimony today before the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221;

Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. 
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said. 
Viniar apologized to Levin a second time after the senator
returned to the hearing room following a vote. &#8220;You were 100
percent right,&#8221; Viniar said.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, boosted
its dividend by 18 percent, almost double last year&#8217;s increase. 
The quarterly payout will rise 10 cents to 65 cents a
share, IBM said today in a statement. The Armonk, New York-based
company also is adding $8 billion to its current stock-
repurchase plan, bringing the total to $10 billion. 
The increases may boost IBM&#8217;s appeal with investors after
the company, led by Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano,
posted its smallest profit increase last year since 2005 as
clients curbed spending amid the recession. Last week, the stock
dropped after IBM reported a decline in first-quarter signings
of service contracts, suggesting corporate spending on larger
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a positive sign,&#8221; UBS AG analyst Maynard Um said of
the dividend boost, noting that investors expected it. He rates
the shares, which he doesn&#8217;t own, &#8220;neutral,&#8221; and said IBM&#8217;s
earnings growth is outpacing sales gains. 
The higher payout reflects the strength of IBM&#8217;s business
more than the economy, Vice President of Financial Management
Jesse Greene said today in an interview. IBM has spent the past
decade investing in its software and services businesses, which
tend to have higher profit margins than hardware. 
Five Acquisitions 
The increases won&#8217;t affect IBM&#8217;s acquisition strategy,
Greene added. The company bought five companies last quarter for
a total of $1 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call last week. Cash flow increased $400
million to about $1.4 billion in the period. 
Sales climbed 5.3 percent last quarter, the largest
increase in more than a year. 
IBM fell $1.91 to $128.82 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 1.6 percent
this year. 
The payout increase marks the 15th year in a row IBM has
raised its dividend, which is payable June 10 to shareholders of
record May 10. Last year was the first time since 2006 the
company didn&#8217;t boost it by 10 cents.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
were grilled by U.S. senators probing the bank&#8217;s mortgage
business as Senator Carl Levin asked why it sold a set of
investments the lender had itself labeled &#8220;shitty.&#8221; 
&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; the
Michigan Democrat asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s
mortgage unit at the time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; 
Levin, who heads the Senate subcommittee that&#8217;s holding
today&#8217;s hearings, was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from
Thomas Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the
Americas at Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a
set of mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying
to sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. 
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. 
Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees including
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein are testifying about the
mortgage-securities business in the years leading to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, had been
sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
contests the claim. 
Tourre Denies Allegations 
As the executives testified, Goldman Sachs shares had one
of three gains among the 79 financial companies in the SP 500.
The stock rose 70 cents to $152.73 as of 12:50 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs employee named by
the SEC, testified today that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied the
allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this false
claim, Tourre, 31, told the standing-room-only hearing of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. 
The transaction referred to by Levin was Timberwolf Ltd., a
$1 billion collateralized debt obligation holding pieces of
other CDOs. The CDO also included optimistic side-bets on the
performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the firm took the
opposite pessimistic side in &#8216;&#8216;many&#8217;&#8217; cases, the panel said. 
Timberwolf&#8217;s 2008 Liquidation 
&#8216;&#8216;Boy that timberwo[l]f was one shitty deal,&#8217;&#8217; Montag, who
is now Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s president of global banking and
markets, said in a June 22, 2007, e-mail. Within five months of
Timberwolf&#8217;s debut, the CDO had lost 80 percent of its value,
and it was liquidated in 2008, according to the statement
yesterday. 
&#8216;&#8216;The message that I took from the e-mail from Mr. Montag
was that my performance on that deal wasn&#8217;t good and I think the
fact that we had lost money related to that wasn&#8217;t good,&#8221;
Sparks said at the hearing. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t use that term in respect
to this deal.&#8221; 
Sparks, 43, who left the bank in 2008, told Montag earlier
on June 22, 2007, that $300 million of Timberwolf securities were
the &#8220;main thing&#8221; left among a group of positions the bank had
bought from an unidentified source, according to the e-mails. In
a June 7, 2007, e-mail, a Goldman Sachs employee said a head of
sales in Korea at the New York-based company felt like he could
&#8220;push&#8221; a buyer whose name was redacted to purchase more of the
debt. 
Blankfein to Speak 
The CDO was among securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the firm needed to reduce its mortgage
holdings, Levin&#8217;s panel said in a statement yesterday. 
Montag, now 53, isn&#8217;t scheduled to appear and didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman
Jessica Oppenheim declined to comment. 
The committee began to release excerpts of the Goldman
Sachs documents yesterday. Today, Blankfein, 55, will tell the
panel his firm didn&#8217;t wager against clients, according to a
prepared text of his remarks. 
&#8220;We believe we at all times worked appropriately with our
clients,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. We did try to manage our
risk, as our shareholders and regulators would expect.&#8217;&#8217; 
Bear Buys Timberwolf 
The Timberwolf CDO was issued in March 2007, following a
Goldman Sachs quarter that ended February 2007 in which one
department of the bank shifted from $6 billion of bets that
mortgage bonds would perform to $10 billion they would default,
according to Bloomberg data and information the panel released. 
Bear Stearns Asset Management, the manager of two hedge
funds overseen by Ralph Cioffi whose collapse in June 2007
roiled global markets, was among the buyers, purchasing about
$300 million, according to the committee. Cioffi&#8217;s funds that
month sold some securities to meet margin calls from lenders. 
Sparks in one e-mail urged &#8220;personnel working on a
potential Korean sale to &#8216;[g]et &#8216;er done,&#8217; and sent a mass e-
mail to the sales force promising &#8216;ginormous credits&#8217; for
selling&#8217;&#8217; the debt, according to Levin&#8217;s statement. &#8216;&#8216;A
congratulatory e-mail was sent to an employee who sold a number
of the securities: &#8216;Great job _ trading us out of our entire
Timberwolf Single-A position,&#8217; &#8217;&#8217; the panel said, potentially
referring to $36 million of A-rated notes. 
Montag&#8217;s Career 
Montag retired from Goldman Sachs in December 2007, and was
recruited in April 2008 by then Merrill Lynch  Co. CEO John A.
Thain to his firm. Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America
in a government-assisted deal at the start of 2009. 
CDOs repackage pools of assets such as mortgage bonds, bank
capital notes and buyout loans into new securities with varying
risks. While Timberwolf was initially intended to be about half
invested in mortgage-bond CDOs and half invested in
collateralized loan obligations tied to company debt, the bank
sold many of its &#8216;&#8216;best-performing&#8217;&#8217; CLOs separately after a
rebound in their values, Levin&#8217;s statement said. 
Levin&#8217;s committee also released e-mails with references to
Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1 and Abacus
2007-AC1, the CDO at the heart of the SEC suit filed April 16. 
The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. -- which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market -- helped the Abacus CDO
manager select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman
Sachs has called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8216;&#8216;completely unfounded.&#8221;
Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. 
Greywolf&#8217;s Role 
CDO managers select the collateral going into the vehicles,
and sometimes reinvest as the underlying positions pay down and
trade in and out of holdings. 
In Timberwolf&#8217;s case, the manager was Purchase, New York-
based Greywolf Capital Management LP. The firm&#8217;s partners
included the late Greg Mount, who joined in 2005 after nine
years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped build its CDOs business,
according to the prospectus and the firm&#8217;s website. 
Greywolf, which focuses on corporate debt and says on its
website it manages $848 million, planned to buy $41 million of
the CDO&#8217;s junior-most tranches, according to the prospectus. In
January 2007, Goldman Sachs underwrote a $502 million CLO
managed by Greywolf tied to high-yield company loans, according
to Bloomberg data. 
Conflicts Disclosed 
The conflicts of interest section of Timberwolf&#8217;s
prospectus said that Greywolf might &#8220;take into consideration
research and other brokerage services&#8221; from investment banks in
its decision-making for the CDO and also make separate
investments with &#8220;interests different from or adverse to&#8221; the
CDO&#8217;s collateral. 
&#8220;Under the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement,&#8221;
Greywolf &#8220;will be permitted to take whatever action is in the
Collateral Manager&#8217;s best interest regardless of the impact on
the Collateral Assets,&#8221; according to the prospectus. 
Mount died last April, the company said in a statement at
the time. Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Greywolf, declined to
immediately comment. 
On Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role, the prospectus said the firm would
act as the sole counterparty for the bullish derivative bets on
CDOs that the vehicle was making through so-called credit-
default swaps, &#8220;which creates concentration risk and may create
certain conflicts of interest.&#8221; 
Matthew G. Bieber, described by the panel as the Goldman
trader responsible for managing Timberwolf&#8217;s issuance, later
characterized the day that the CDO was created as &#8220;a day that
will live in infamy,&#8221; according to an e-mail released today. 
An employee at Goldman Sachs who today answered a number
for Bieber said that he was &#8220;off the desk&#8221; and didn&#8217;t take a
message.

Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, told a Senate subcommittee that
he will defend himself in court against the suit. 
&#8220;I deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations,&#8221; Tourre, 31,
said today at a standing-room-only hearing of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. &#8220;I will defend
myself in court against this false claim,&#8221; he said, adding that
a deal at the center of the suit &#8220;was not designed to fail.&#8221; 
Tourre spoke after protesters dressed in prison garb held
up signs reading &#8220;shame&#8221; and one shouted, &#8220;Too big to fail but
not too big for jail.&#8221; Six other current and former Goldman
Sachs employees including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein are testifying today about the firm&#8217;s mortgage-
securities business in the years leading up to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, contests
the SEC&#8217;s suit, saying it provided investors with all of the
information they needed. 
In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market teetered, Goldman
Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to investors ACA Management LLC and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped
pick the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle,
known as Abacus 2007-AC1, the SEC said. 
In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tourre misled ACA
into thinking that Paulson planned to invest in the equity, or
riskiest piece, of the deal instead of betting against it by
buying credit protection. 
&#8216;Most Important Clients&#8217; 
&#8220;I never told ACA, the portfolio selection agent, that
Paulson  Co. would be an equity investor in the AC-1
transaction or would take any long position in the deal,&#8221;
Tourre told the panel, as media including television crews from
Japan and Russia looked on. &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t recall the exact
words that I used, I recall informing ACA that Paulson&#8217;s fund
was expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior
tranches.&#8221; 
Tourre also told the panel that ACA and IKB were
&#8220;institutions with significant resources and experience in the
CDO market&#8221; and that they &#8220;were two of the most important
clients of my desk.&#8221; 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs also had no economic motive to design the
AC-1 transaction to fail,&#8221; said. 
&#8216;Unfounded Attacks&#8217; 
&#8220;I have been the target of unfounded attacks on my
character and motives,&#8221; Tourre said. &#8220;I appreciate the
opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to answer these
false charges.&#8221; 
The line to get into today&#8217;s hearing stretched down the
corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate office
building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the head of
the line were four protestors dressed in jail stripes holding
&#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for Tourre and Blankfein. 
&#8220;Blankfein&#8217;s not doing God&#8217;s work, he&#8217;s doing the work of
the devil,&#8221; one of the protestors said, referring to a comment
Blankfein made in November while defending the banking industry. 
Tourre was placed on paid leave by Goldman Sachs after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed its suit on April 16.
Joining him on the first panel of witnesses were Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured products group,
Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the same group,
and Daniel Sparks, a former partner who ran the mortgage
department. 
Viniar, Broderick 
Later today, the panel will hear from David Viniar, the
firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick, the chief
risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final witness at the
end of the day. 
Goldman Sachs made an estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by
placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked securities,
including some it created, Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who
leads the investigations panel, said. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t just make money, it profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it did not want to succeed and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
its customers,&#8221; Levin said today in his opening remarks. &#8220;Its
conduct brings into question the whole conduct of Wall Street.&#8221; 
Blankfein, in his prepared remarks, said the firm &#8220;didn&#8217;t
have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly
did not bet against our clients.&#8221; 
Paulson&#8217;s Position 
Tourre &#8220;believes that he indicated&#8221; to investors that
Paulson was interested in taking a &#8220;short&#8221; position on the
deal, meaning he was betting against it, Greg Palm, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said last week. 
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican Senator from Maine, said
in her opening Statement that &#8220;even legal practices can raise
ethical concerns.&#8221; 
&#8220;There is something unseemly about Goldman betting against
the housing market at the same time as it is selling to its
clients mortgage backed securities containing toxic loans,&#8221;
Collins said. 
&#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime now,&#8221;
Tourre wrote to a friend in a January 2007 e-mail, according to
the SEC complaint. &#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous
Fab... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly
leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily
understanding all of the implications of those
monstruosities!!!&#8221; 
&#8216;Not Too Brilliant&#8217; 
In a March 7, 2007, e-mail released by the firm, Tourre
described the U.S. subprime mortgage market as &#8220;not too
brilliant&#8221; and said that &#8220;according to Sparks,&#8221; an apparent
reference to Daniel Sparks who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage
business at the time, &#8220;that business is totally dead, and the
poor little subprime borrowers will not last too long!!!&#8221; 
John McCain, the Republican Senator from Arizona, said he
didn&#8217;t know if anything Goldman Sachs did was illegal. 
&#8220;But from the reading of these e-mails and the information
that this committee has uncovered there&#8217;s no doubt that their
behavior was unethical,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;The American people will
render a judgment as well as the courts.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, has the worst-performing actively traded corporate
bonds from a benchmark offering this year. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due 2020 have fallen
3.9 cents on the dollar since being issued on March 1 to 95.9
cents as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt yields 2.17 percentage points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries. 
The debt has declined 5.18 cents since April 15, the day
before the SEC said New York-based Goldman Sachs created and
sold securities linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying loans and bet against
the vehicles. 
Goldman Sachs executives, including Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, are scheduled to appear today
before a Senate subcommittee. The SEC&#8217;s allegations &#8220;are
completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs said April 16 in a statement. 
Financial company bonds yielded 1.93 percentage points more
than benchmarks as of yesterday, an increase of 0.07 percentage
point from April 15, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Financial Corporate Index.

Morgan Stanley plans to open an
investment unit in Poland, following some of the world&#8217;s biggest
banks seeking to land fees from planned government asset sales. 
The New York-based company will join Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG in vying for advisory work in a
market &#8220;that&#8217;s becoming a leading financial hub in central and
eastern Europe,&#8221; Franck Petitgas, the head of investment
banking at Morgan Stanley, said in a statement today. 
The Polish government this year plans to sell stakes in its
energy, insurance, chemical and phone companies to raise $10
billion to finance the widening budget deficit. Potential
advisory work on those sales is helping draw in foreign banks,
while the economy is the only one in the European Union that has
avoided a recession. 
Marcin Socha, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s executive director in
Poland, will head the Warsaw office. The bank also plans to
become a member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange to give its
customers direct access to stocks traded in the Polish capital,
it said. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is also seeking to open a
branch office in Warsaw, spokeswoman Monika Schaller said on
March 25. Credit Suisse announced in January a plan to open a
brokerage this year after shuttering its Warsaw stock-dealing
business in 2003.

Global demand for dry bulk
commodities will expand 6 percent this year, compared with a
previous forecast of 3.7 percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. 
The bank now expects iron-ore trade growth of 11.2 percent,
from an earlier estimate of 5.7 percent, and coal demand
expansion of 5.7 percent, from 3.8 percent, analysts Jonathan
Chappell and Darren Hicks in New York wrote in a note today. 
The increased trade will coincide with half the ships that
are scheduled to be built this year being delayed or cancelled,
as yards in Asia fail to deliver a record order book on time,
they said. 
&#8220;We do not believe that it is even physically possible for
the shipyards to meet this robust schedule, with or without
financing concerns,&#8221; they added. 
JPMorgan increased its forecasts for what ships will earn
as a result by as much as 33 percent. 
So-called panamax ships, the largest to sail through the
Panama Canal, will average $21,200 a day this year, up from a
previous forecast of $16,000, JPMorgan said. Rates for
capesizes, most commonly used to haul iron ore, were revised up

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, will face off against a U.S.
Senate subcommittee today in a pivotal hearing that could have
repercussions for the future of the financial industry. 
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released documents
that he said showed the company &#8220;put its own interest and
profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221; a conflict he
called on Congress to end. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, will dispute that
assertion and argue the firm was merely managing its own risk. 
The hearing takes place as the Senate debates financial
reform legislation that could prevent banks from trading for
their own accounts and require them to separate derivatives
businesses from regulated depository subsidiaries. It also
follows a U.S. regulator&#8217;s civil-fraud lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre, for misleading investors
in a mortgage-linked investment, charges the firm denies. 
&#8220;This market is not free until it is free of self-dealing
and until it is free of conflict of interest,&#8221; Levin, 75, said
at a press briefing yesterday. &#8220;It is not free until it ends
the gambling operation that results in gambling debts that the
public ends up paying.&#8221; 
Tourre, Blankfein 
The hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. in Washington, will
start with questioning of Tourre; Michael Swenson, a managing
director in the structured-products group; Joshua Birnbaum, a
former managing director in the same group; and Daniel Sparks, a
former partner who ran the mortgage department. 
Later in the day, the subcommittee will hear from David
Viniar, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick,
the chief risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final
witness, facing the panel alone at the end of the hearing. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will tell the committee, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. 
While the firm contests the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do a
better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
Shares Fall 
Goldman Sachs fell 0.4 percent to $151.43 by 12:23 p.m. in
Germany, after dropping 3.4 percent to $152.03 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, before Levin&#8217;s statements
were made public. The shares have tumbled 17 percent from their
level before the SEC filed its suit and are down 10 percent so
far this year in New York. 
Yesterday U.S. Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from
advancing their plan to overhaul Wall Street regulation as the
two sides debate provisions including consumer protections and
derivatives. Both parties are trying to tap into voter anger at
Wall Street and the bank bailouts that took place as Americans
grappled with record home foreclosures and rising unemployment. 
Goldman Sachs would probably be hardest hit among large
U.S. banks if Congress bans firms from trading for their own
account. Viniar, the CFO who&#8217;s scheduled to testify today,
estimated in January that approximately 10 percent of the
company&#8217;s revenue derives from trading that has no connection
with customer business. That would have been about $4.5 billion
last year. 
Employees of Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay
record in 2007 when Blankfein was awarded a $67.9 million bonus,
are among the biggest political donors in the last two decades. 
Campaign Contributions 
Nine of the 10 members of Levin&#8217;s committee have accepted
campaign finance donations from the firm&#8217;s employees, both
individually and through a political action committee, since
1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based research group. The exception is Senator Edward
Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware, who never raised money for an
election because he was appointed to fill Vice President Joseph
Biden&#8217;s former seat and hasn&#8217;t run for a full term. 
Arizona Republican John McCain, who ran for president in
2000 and 2008, has accepted the most of any member of the
subcommittee with $337,065, while Jon Tester, a Democrat from
Montana, has taken just $6,400, the group&#8217;s data show. 
While the spotlight is on Goldman Sachs at today&#8217;s hearing,
Levin emphasized that the firm&#8217;s actions represent practices
that he said are widespread on Wall Street. 
&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;We think there
are a number of banks engaged in similar conduct, but we had to
focus on one.&#8221; 
&#8216;Heavy Bets&#8217; 
Levin, whose committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs in June, estimates that the firm made $3.7 billion
in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked
securities, including some it created. The figure doesn&#8217;t take
into account losses Goldman Sachs suffered on mortgage-related
securities it held, he said. 
&#8220;We respectfully disagree with Chairman Levin&#8217;s
statement,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
said yesterday. &#8220;We did not have a big bet against the housing
market, as our performance in residential mortgages
demonstrates, and we believe we at all times worked
appropriately with our clients.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs released data on April 24 that showed the
firm reaped gains on its mortgage trading activities in 2007 and
then lost money in the same unit in 2008. 
&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; 
Among the evidence Levin released yesterday was an internal
e-mail that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk
started the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB-
rated mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; 
An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Sparks, who ran the
mortgage business and is among those testifying today, includes
the comment &#8220;real bad feeling across European sales about some
of the trades we did with clients. The damage this has done to
our franchise is very significant. Aggregate loss of our clients
on just these 5 trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; 
Swenson, the managing director in the structured-products
group who is also to appear today, boasted in his 2007
performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to clients who demanded
that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program as clients tried to
gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring to the name for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those were
unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of millions
of dollars.&#8221; 
Conveyor Belt 
In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from those of institutional clients. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
Conflicts of Interest 
Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether any crimes occurred, although he said the panel will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the SEC
or the Justice Department. 
&#8220;The SEC and the courts will resolve the legal question of
whether Goldman&#8217;s actions broke the law,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The
question for us is whether Goldman&#8217;s actions in 2007 were
appropriate and whether we should act, legislatively, to bar
similar actions in the future.&#8221; 
While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package in the Senate this week, he said he thinks it
could be strengthened. He has proposed an amendment that would
help resolve the conflicts of interest among Wall Street firms
that he said are embodied in the documents. He also endorsed
banning so-called naked credit-default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the underlying loans or bonds. 
&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; 
After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
Web site on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. 
Goldman Sachs disputes the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a collateralized debt
obligation tied to mortgages by failing to inform them of the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. The company said on
April 24 that Levin&#8217;s committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence
it released and jumped to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a
hearing.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then topped
that in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. 
&#8216;Ultimate Harm&#8217; 
While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. 
&#8220;The ultimate harm here is not just to the clients who
were not well-served by their investment bank, the harm here is
to all of us,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman
Sachs and others helped inject into our financial system have
done incalculable harm to people who have never heard of a
synthetic CDO and who have no defenses against the harm that
such exotic Wall Street creations can cause.&#8221;

Chevron Corp. and its partners in
the Gorgon liquefied natural gas venture off northwest Australia
have awarded about A$20 billion ($19 billion) in contracts, with
Australian companies winning more than a third of the work. 
A Leighton Holdings Ltd. unit is among Australian
contractors that have gained more than A$7 billion in combined
Gorgon orders, Chevron Australia said in its Frontier magazine.
The company plans to add 700 workers in Australia by the end of
this year as the country&#8217;s importance to Chevron&#8217;s global
operations grows. 
Australian gas developments have become the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221;
of Chevron&#8217;s growth strategy as the second-largest U.S. energy
producer advances the A$43 billion Gorgon venture, Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in the publication. 
Chevron expects to employ more than 2,500 people in
Australia by the end of 2010, compared with 1,800 now, the
company said. Gorgon, due to start LNG exports in 2014, has
already generated almost 3,000 jobs, the company estimated. 
The construction of Gorgon on the Barrow Island nature
reserve is proceeding after San Ramon, California-based Chevron,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc approved the project
last year. Unions and contractors reached an agreement on
working conditions in January, Chevron said. 
The venture, Australia&#8217;s largest resources investment, will
spend A$20 billion on Australian &#8220;goods and services&#8221; over the
next five years, Chevron said. The U.S. oil and gas producer&#8217;s
Wheatstone venture, also in Western Australia, is among more
than a dozen proposed LNG projects in Australia targeting rising
Asian demand for cleaner-burning fuels.

An environmental report for Chevron
Corp.&#8217;s plan to upgrade an oil refinery near San Francisco
failed to adequately specify whether heavier and more polluting
crude oil could be processed or disclose measures for mitigating
increases in greenhouse gas emissions, a California court ruled. 
A state appeals court in San Francisco yesterday found that
elements of the report violated requirements of California&#8217;s
environmental quality law. The Richmond City Council relied on
the report when it voted 5-4 in 2008 to issue permits for the
Chevron project in that city, according to the ruling. 
The project, which would replace equipment including a
40-year-old hydrogen unit, was halted after a state court judge
ruled that an environmental permit was inadequate. Groups
including Earthjustice and Communities for a Better Environment
alleged in a lawsuit that the project would increase pollution. 
Chevron is reviewing the ruling, said spokesman Brent
Tippen, in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We feel both the evidence and the law amply supported the
adequacy of the environmental impact report prepared by the city
of Richmond for the renewal project,&#8221; Tippen said in the
statement. &#8220;Chevron believes that the renewal project was
properly analyzed and permitted.&#8221; 
Chevron and environmental groups halted talks on reviving
the project, Chevron said in July. 
The case is Communities for a Better Environment v. City of
Richmond, A125618, Court of Appeal (San Francisco).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which for
years saw no need to play a traditional Washington lobbying
game, is deploying former lawmakers and crisis specialists as it
tries to tamp down the political firestorm threatening its well-
honed brand. 
The firm&#8217;s 12-person government affairs office in
Washington is aiding what one person involved called a franchise
protection strategy in the wake of a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud suit against the firm this month. Advisers
include an ex-House Democratic Leader, a chief of staff to
President Ronald Reagan, President Bill Clinton&#8217;s SEC chairman
and President Barack Obama&#8217;s first White House counsel. 
The first test of the campaign comes today as Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six other current or
former Goldman Sachs employees testify before a Senate panel
investigating the company&#8217;s role in fueling the subprime loan
crisis. The grilling is a turnabout for the firm, which has seen
its former partners become Treasury secretaries, top
presidential aides and even senators. 
&#8220;Goldman relied on their top-level connections so they
wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the public relations and the crisis
lobbying,&#8221; said Mark Corallo, a former Justice Department
spokesman who now provides communications advice to companies.
&#8220;Seemingly they haven&#8217;t learned the lesson of politics: In a
crisis, it&#8217;s every man for himself.&#8221;

Levin, who questioned Goldman Sachs executives during a

JPMorgan Chase  Co. will stop
financing tax-refund loans for about 13,000 independent U.S.
preparers, according to a person at the bank briefed on the
matter, a move that may drive customers toward HR Block Inc. 
The bank decided tax-refund loans don&#8217;t fit the New York-
based company&#8217;s strategic plans, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced.
American Banker, the industry trade journal, reported the halt
earlier today. 
&#8220;Block is the biggest winner in this,&#8221; said John Hewitt,
chief executive officer of Liberty Tax Service, a privately held
company in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that also may benefit. 
Refund-anticipation loans, or RALs, are used to attract
clients who need cash immediately by offering short-term loans
based on the expected amount of their tax refunds. Consumer
groups fault RALs for putting people deeper in debt, with interest rates on some versions that exceed 100 percent on an
annualized basis. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender after Bank of
America Corp., joins banks that have stopped offering refund-
anticipation loans or plan to do so, including London-based HSBC
Holdings Plc and Santa Barbara Bank  Trust. The decision may
give Kansas City, Missouri-based HR Block an advantage through
2013, when its contract with HSBC expires.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Dan Toscano as co-head of global
leveraged and acquisition finance as lending to non-investment
grade companies rebounds. 
Toscano, 45, will join the New York-based firm May 3 and
will lead the group with Gene Martin, according to an internal
memo from Raj Dhanda, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of global capital
markets. A copy of the memo was obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney. 
Toscano was co-head of leveraged and acquisition finance in
the Americas at HSBC Holdings Plc, which he left last year. He
also worked in leveraged finance at Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers
Trust Co. for almost 16 years, according to the memo. 
Leveraged lending has rebounded this year after the amount
of high-yield loans dropped in 2009 to the lowest level since
2001. Companies borrowed $66.8 billion in the U.S. syndicated
leveraged loan market in the first quarter, more than five times
that of a year earlier, according to Bloomberg data. High-yield,
or leveraged, loans are those rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service or BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. led
lenders to CF Industries Holdings Inc. to finance the $4.7
billion takeover of Terra Industries Inc., which was completed
this month. 
Toscano is at least the fourth senior hire for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s capital markets unit in the last six months. The firm
hired John Moore from 3i Capital to serve as co-head of equity
capital markets for the Americas earlier this month, according
to an April 12 memo. 
Last month, the unit hired Wylie Collins a vice chairman
for global capital markets. He was previously head of Americas
debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch  Co. Morgan Stanley hired
David Moffitt, also a former Merrill Lynch executive, in
November as head of global credit solutions. 
Whit Marshall will serve as head of leveraged and
acquisition finance for the Americas, and Matt Naber and Mark
Walsh will continue to lead the unit in Europe, the memo said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Petroleo
Brasileiro SA and other oil producers offered Argentine workers
an 18 percent raise in a bid to avert a nationwide strike that
could lead to fuel shortages, an industry group said. 
The Oil Industry Chamber, which also represents Royal Dutch
Shell Plc in salary negotiations with unions, will discuss the
offer in government-brokered talks with union officials
tomorrow, Executive Director Enrique Pourteau said in a
telephone interview today. The Argentine Federation of Oil, Gas
and Biofuel Workers called a strike for April 30. 
Petrobras, Exxon, Shell, Destileria Argentina de Petroleo
SA and Rutilex Hidrocarburos Argentinos SA refine about 50
percent of the country&#8217;s fuel in the seven cities where the
federation plans the stoppage. A fuel shortage in Argentina
would come at a time when neighboring Chile is boosting imports
from Asia to cover domestic demand after a Feb. 27 earthquake
devastated the country&#8217;s biggest refinery. 
The union hasn&#8217;t named the units that will be affected by
the Argentine strike. Eight refineries in the seven cities have
a combined capacity to process 330,800 barrels of oil a day, or
about 50 percent of Argentina&#8217;s total refining capacity,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Repsol YPF SA&#8217;s Argentine unit said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg News that its three refineries in the country won&#8217;t be
affected by a strike because its workers belong to a different
union. The units have a combined capacity to process 320,000
barrels per day.

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.,
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke beverages, has
surpassed National Bank of Greece SA to become the nation&#8217;s
biggest company by market value after the Greek debt crisis
caused banking stocks to plunge. 
Coca-Cola Hellenic, which is 24 percent owned by the Coca-
Cola Co., has a value of more than 7 billion euros ($9.3
billion), the only such company on the Athens exchange, after
National Bank plunged more than 41 percent this year on concern
over the country&#8217;s debt. Shares in the bottler gained 0.5
percent to 19.80 euros today, for a value of 7.2 billion euros. 
National Bank, the country&#8217;s oldest and biggest bank,
rebounded today for the first time since April 15 after the
country&#8217;s securities regulator banned short selling on the
bourse for two months. The lender gained 8.5 percent to 10.85
euros, valuing the business at 6.5 billion euros. 
Athens-based CCHBC bottles Coca-Cola drinks, teas, water
and juices in 27 European countries, including Russia, and
Nigeria, and its geographical expansion has helped buffer the
company from the effects of the Greek economic crisis. The
company may tomorrow say first-quarter profit jumped to 13.9
million euros ($18.5 million) from 1.9 million euros a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
endured more than 10 hours of congressional grilling in one of
the most public, and most hostile, political lashings in the
firm&#8217;s 141-year history. By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s
market value had risen by $549 million. 
Senator Carl Levin and members of his Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations said evidence they presented made
the case for Congress to pass legislation tightening financial
regulation. Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm, was alone among 79 stocks of the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index in posting a gain yesterday. 
&#8220;Both sides got what they wanted,&#8221; said Robert Hillman, a
securities law professor at the University of California, Davis.
&#8220;The Senate probably did what it felt it had to do, which was
bring Goldman people up and embarrass them. For Goldman, the
goal was to demonstrate that they had not engaged in fraud or
illegal conduct. They probably succeeded in that.&#8221; 
The senators, capping a probe of Goldman Sachs that has
lasted more than a year, peppered Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former executives with questions
about their duty to clients and the ethics of betting against
the housing market as the bank sold mortgage-linked securities
to customers. The hearing came 12 days after the Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the New York-based firm for fraud,
saying the bank misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment
known as Abacus, claims the company denies. 
&#8216;Jarring&#8217; Realities 
&#8220;The cultural realities of what you all do is jarring to
most Americans,&#8221; Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from
Missouri and former prosecutor, told Blankfein during the
hearing. &#8220;This notion of selling a product that you&#8217;re betting
against is hard for people to understand.&#8221; 
Blankfein, who repeatedly insisted the company had done
nothing wrong, said after the hearing that he had &#8220;no
illusions&#8221; about how hard Wall Street must work to win back the
trust of the American people. 
&#8220;Wall Street has a lot of work to do to regain the
confidence of Main Street,&#8221; Blankfein told Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;We have a lot to improve in our communication with
Main Street and we&#8217;re committed to do it.&#8221; 
In a voicemail to employees last night, Blankfein called
the questioning &#8220;rigorous,&#8221; and said he tried to convey the
&#8220;seriousness with which we adhere to the rules and regulations
that govern our business.&#8221; 
&#8216;Continued External Focus&#8217; 
&#8220;Let me remind you that we should anticipate continued
external focus on Goldman Sachs for the foreseeable future,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the message. &#8220;Please do not let this distract
you from your daily responsibilities.&#8221; 
Some senators used the hearing to advertise their position
on a financial regulatory bill that&#8217;s been blocked by
Republicans so far this week. Levin concluded the hearing by
calling for tougher regulation than the bill contains, while
Republicans including Tom Coburn said they felt the measure
fails to address issues such as how to handle companies that are
&#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; 
As the day began, a line to enter the hearing stretched
down the corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate
office building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the
head of the queue were four protesters dressed in black-and-
white convict stripes and holding &#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for
Blankfein and Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Frenchman who was
the only Goldman Sachs employee named in the SEC suit.
Television crews from Russia and Japan were among journalists
who filled the packed room. 
&#8216;Huge Shorts&#8217; 
Disagreements between the senators and the executives
started with how much money the bank earned. Levin said Goldman
Sachs made $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;huge shorts&#8221;
against mortgage-linked securities. Taking into account losses
on securities it held, the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
securities had net revenue of less than $500 million, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said. 
&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; Levin
asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s mortgage unit at the
time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; 
Levin was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from Thomas
Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the Americas at
Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a set of
mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying to
sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; 
&#8216;I Don&#8217;t Recall&#8217; 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. 
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. 
Blankfein, responding to questions from Levin, said the
nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers and market-makers have no obligation
to tell clients about their own position in a security. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; 
Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told Blankfein he&#8217;s
&#8220;troubled&#8221; by his view that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to
understand conflicts of interest. 
&#8216;Troubles Me&#8217; 
&#8220;You can make sure that someone you sell an investment to
knows that you believe it&#8217;s a bad investment,&#8221; Levin said.
&#8220;You obviously don&#8217;t see that. It troubles me that you don&#8217;t
see that.&#8221; 
Levin added, &#8220;It troubles me that you don&#8217;t see that your
client is yourself. Goldman Sachs has turned itself into its own
client.&#8221; 
The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market, helped the Abacus CDO manager
select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman Sachs has
called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; Paulson
wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. 
Tourre, wearing a charcoal-gray suit, white shirt and red-
and-navy striped tie, testified that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied
the allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this
false claim,&#8221; Tourre told the standing-room-only hearing. 
Conveying Risks 
&#8220;The securities weren&#8217;t meant to fail; they succeeded by
conveying the risks that people wanted,&#8221; Blankfein told Senator
Jon Tester about the Abacus deal. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re speaking a different language
here,&#8221; replied Tester, a Democrat from Montana who was a farmer
before he entered politics. Tester said &#8220;it seemed to me more
than just a little bit odd&#8221; that Paulson helped pick securities
even as he was betting against a CDO that later collapsed in
value. 
The politicians expressed frustration over a lack of direct
answers during the first panel, which lasted more than five
hours and featured testimony from Tourre; Sparks; Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured-products group;
and Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the group. 
Levin and Viniar, the chief financial officer, agreed on at
least one thing during his testimony: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221; 
&#8216;Very Unfortunate&#8217; 
&#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate to have on e-mail,&#8221;
Viniar said, drawing laughter from the audience and the press,
after Levin asked how he felt when he read e-mails in which
Goldman Sachs employees described mortgage-linked securities as
&#8220;crap&#8221; or &#8220;shitty.&#8221; 
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t take that the wrong way,&#8221; Viniar said when
pressed by Levin. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate for anyone
to have said that in any form.&#8221; 
Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. 
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest company, posted a smaller gain in first-quarter profit
than analysts estimated as health-care legislation increased
costs and U.S. refineries operated at a loss. 
Net income rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a
share, from $4.55 billion, or 92 cents, a year earlier, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon said today in a statement. Per-share profit
was 8 cents below the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. 
Exxon recorded a $200 million charge to reflect an increase
in health-care costs driven by legislation that President Barack
Obama signed into law last month. The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries
lost more than $600,000 a day as gains in gasoline and diesel
prices failed to keep pace with crude-oil costs. 
&#8220;The costs of health-care legislation are a hit every
company is going to take in one shape or another,&#8221; said Gianna
Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research in Flossmoor,
Illinois. &#8220;In refining, they&#8217;re taking it on the chin because
crude is so expensive and demand for fuel is lackluster.&#8221; 
Exxon fell 53 cents to $68.66 as of the 4 p.m. close of New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has 10 buy
ratings from analysts, 10 holds and 1 sell. 
The profit increase was Exxon&#8217;s first since the 2008 third
quarter. The company benefited from a jump in oil prices and its
biggest gain in first-quarter crude and natural-gas production
since 2000. Revenue climbed 41 percent to $90.3 billion. 
Cash Stockpile Grows 
The company spent $2 billion on share buybacks during the
first three months of the year and intends to maintain that pace
of purchases during the current quarter, according to the
statement. Exxon&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents rose by $3 billion
during the January-to-March period, to $13.7 billion. 
Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 66 percent to $5.81
billion. Exxon was paid an average of $74.21 per barrel of crude
sold outside the U.S., a 77 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to data on the company&#8217;s Web site. 
Exxon increased production 4.5 percent to the equivalent of
4.36 million barrels of crude a day, led by higher gas output in
the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Gas from Exxon&#8217;s
U.S. wells sold for $5.32 per thousand cubic feet, a 15 percent
increase. 
Global oil demand increased enough to fill 83 supertankers
after economies around the world emerged from recession,
according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Refining Margins Narrow 
Exxon&#8217;s worldwide refining profit tumbled 97 percent to $37
million as margins from processing crude into fuels such as
gasoline and jet fuel in the U.S. evaporated. Chemicals earnings
more than tripled to $1.25 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans $28 billion in
capital spending this year to boost production with new wells
from California to the Middle East and to upgrade refineries.
Exxon also agreed in December to buy XTO Energy Inc., the
largest U.S. gas producer, for more than $29 billion. 
Exxon plans to close the purchase of Fort Worth, Texas-
based XTO by the end of June. The acquisition, Exxon&#8217;s largest
since it bought the former Mobil Corp. in 1999, will give the
company access to XTO&#8217;s gas reserves and its expertise in
tapping rock formations impervious to conventional drilling
techniques. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company,
yesterday said its net income climbed 57 percent to $5.48
billion. BP Plc of London said April 27 that its first-quarter
profit more than doubled to $6.08 billion. 
Earnings also more than doubled at ConocoPhillips and
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the third- and fourth-largest U.S.
oil companies by market value, which released their reports
today. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, is
scheduled to report earnings tomorrow.

Options traders are boosting bets
that shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most-profitable
Wall Street firm, will rebound from losses spurred by the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. 
Investors used a butterfly strategy yesterday, spending an
average of $1.56 per trade on contracts expiring in June,
according to a report from Interactive Brokers Group Inc. The
maximum profit of $8.44 per spread is earned should Goldman
Sachs close at $175 on June 18, the brokerage said. The shares
have sunk to $160.24 from $184.27 on April 15, the day before
the SEC announced its lawsuit. 
&#8220;The transaction is a very efficient way to act on bullish
sentiment because maximum loss potential -- $1.56 per contract
in this case -- is scant when compared to potential profits
which are 5.4 times greater,&#8221; Caitlin Duffy of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers wrote in a note yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs fell the most since January 2009 on April 16
after the SEC said the bank misled investors in a mortgage-
linked investment. On April 27, executives endured more than 10
hours of congressional grilling in one of the most public, and
most hostile, political lashings in the firm&#8217;s 141-year history.
By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s market value had risen by
$549 million, and it posted the only gain among 79 financial
institutions in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
June Contracts 
To create the butterfly yesterday, investors bought about
8,000 June $165 calls and 8,000 June $185 calls, while selling
16,000 June $175 calls. More than 108,000 Goldman Sachs calls
traded yesterday, 30 percent above than the four-week average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Interactive Brokers said that traders also used a bullish
butterfly strategy on Goldman Sachs on April 26 and April 27. 
A butterfly spread strategy combines three options with the
same expiration date and different strike prices, with half of
the contracts bought or sold at the middle strike price and the
rest divided among the top and bottom. 
Today, an investor made a bullish bet by selling almost
10,000 calls at the May $170 strike while buying June $165 calls
and selling June $175 calls, Duffy said. 
Goldman Sachs shares rose 2.1 percent today, rallying for
the third straight day.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are among U.S. investment banks that may be
forced to raise an additional $250 billion in capital, cut
executive pay and divest some of their most lucrative assets
under a bill on the U.S. Senate floor today, analysts say. 
A two-page provision tucked inside the 1,558-page bill on
April 21 would change the structure of about 40 of the largest
U.S. investment banks by forcing them to spin off their
derivatives businesses. Another measure added this month would
require derivatives dealers to maintain a &#8220;fiduciary duty&#8221; to
municipal, pension and retirement plan investors, which some
analysts say would wipe out that market altogether. 
&#8220;The bill has moved so far left so hard, that it&#8217;s caught
everybody by surprise,&#8221; said FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia. He said the bill was a &#8220;big, big hot button issue
with voters.&#8221; &#8220;The Street now is just realizing that all of
this stuff is getting in the bill.&#8221; 
The spin-off provision would result in a capital deficit of
$85 billion at eight of the largest global investment banks,
analysts led by Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan Securities in
London estimated in a research note today. It prohibits swaps
dealers from taking any federal assistance, including access to
the Federal Reserve discount window or deposit insurance from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Spinning out Derivatives 
At a minimum, the measure would require banks to spin out
their derivatives business into a separately capitalized
affiliate, analysts say. It was actually designed to force about
40 of the largest U.S. swaps dealers that also have federally
insured banks to divest all swaps activities, said Courtney
Rowe, a spokeswoman for bill sponsor Senator Blanche Lincoln,
who sponsored the bill. 
&#8220;This would be a sweeping change to our financial system
and it was introduced 11 days ago without a hearing, without a
study on its impact,&#8221; said Luke Zubrod of Pennsylvania-based
Chatham Financial Corp., which advises more than 1,000 firms on
derivatives. 
If passed, analysts say the provision would drive business
to foreign broker dealers that don&#8217;t take deposits in the U.S.,
such as Societe Generale, France&#8217;s No. 2 bank by market value.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which
represents Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and other large
derivatives dealers, estimates the provision would require as
much as $250 billion in new capital. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that the proposed regulatory
changes would have a significant impact on global return on
equities, declining from 19 percent pre-regulation to 12
percent,&#8221; Abouhossein wrote. &#8220;Given the political pressure in
various geographies, we believe investment bank compensation
reduction would be a key driver&#8221; to boost profitability. 
&#8216;Banks Should Be Banks&#8217; 
Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, said she may not have the
votes to pass the measure, and several other amendments are
pending in the Senate that would potentially separate certain
investment-banking activities from the traditional business of
taking deposits and lending money. 
&#8220;Banks should be banks,&#8221; Rowe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from
Arkansans, especially our community banks in Arkansas, that they
need a level playing field.&#8221; 
Analysts say they fear that anger over Wall Street may
drive support for more burdensome amendments, like reinstating
Glass-Steagall-like regulations that separated investment and
commercial banking. 
&#8220;There really is a new kind of political model at work
here,&#8221; said Brian Gardner, an analyst for KBW Inc. in
Washington and a former staff director for Louisiana
Representative Richard Baker, who was chair of the House
Financial Services committee sub-committee before he left
Congress in 2008. &#8220;The dissatisfaction with Wall Street and
then the Goldman news has just changed the political dynamic.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has a larger exposure than any of
its peers to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain,
according to Wells Fargo  Co. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure to the five so-called PIIGS countries
is $36.3 billion, equating to 28 percent of the firm&#8217;s Tier-1
capital, a measure of financial strength, Wells Fargo analysts
including Matthew Burnell wrote today. Morgan Stanley holds
$32.4 billion of debt in the region, which equates to 69 percent
of its Tier 1 capital, Burnell wrote. 
&#8220;Regulatory data suggests JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure is largest
in aggregate, but Morgan Stanley held the largest aggregate
exposure to the PIIGS relative to Tier 1 capital,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. Overall U.S. bank &#8220;exposure to Greece is lower than
exposure to Ireland, Italy and Spain.&#8221; 
Bonds and stocks plunged across Europe in the past week on
concern the Greek debt crisis is spreading across the euro area.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s this week cut Greece, Portugal and Spain&#8217;s
credit ratings as concern the nations may fail to meet their
debt commitments increased. 
U.S. banks held a total of $236.8 billion of exposure to
the five nations, including $18.1 billion to Greece, Wells Fargo
said. European banks have claims totaling $193.1 billion on
Greece, according to the Bank for International Settlements,
with another $832.2 billion of claims on Spain.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. met
regulators from the U.K. Financial Services Authority today to
formally discuss how the agency&#8217;s probe into the bank will
progress, two people familiar with the investigation said. 
It was the first time Goldman Sachs and the agency met to
discuss the timetable of the probe, the people said, on
condition of anonymity because the inquiry is confidential. The
regulator has a duty to meet with firms it is investigating at
an early stage to outline what will happen during the probe. 
The FSA said earlier this month that it was investigating
Goldman Sachs&#8217; London office after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over the New York-based
bank&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. Prime
Minister Gordon Brown, facing a May 6 election, called on the
FSA to investigate after the SEC suit. 
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and FSA spokesman
Chris Hamilton both declined to comment. Sky News first reported
the meeting today. 
The bank may be fined or individuals banned if the FSA
finds a breach of its rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president
named in the SEC case, Fabrice Tourre, is employed at the bank&#8217;s
London office. His FSA authorization was suspended at the firm&#8217;s
request. 
Senate Questioning 
Goldman Sachs executives, including Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, were questioned by a U.S. Senate Subcommittee
earlier this week over the bank&#8217;s marketing of CDOs, which the
SEC alleges was fraudulent. Goldman Sachs denies the allegations
and has said it will fight the suit. 
Tourre was also questioned at the Senate hearing. He
started working at the London office in November 2008, according
to the FSA&#8217;s register, and the SEC&#8217;s allegations relate to when
he worked in New York. 
The French markets regulator, the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said today it found no evidence that local fund-
management companies bought the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-AC1,
which is the subject of the SEC lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s BaFin
regulator said this month it will seek information from the SEC
about the case. 
German and British banks both lost money because of the
fraud, according to the SEC suit. The Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, majority-owned by U.K. taxpayers, unwound a position
in Abacus bought by its ABN Amro unit by paying Goldman Sachs
$840.9 million, the SEC said. Germany&#8217;s IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG lost nearly all of its $150 million investment
in the CDO, according to the SEC. 
CDOs bundle bonds or loans, or both, from a variety of
issuers, such as companies or countries. Interest payments on
the underlying bonds or loans are used to pay investors.

Incentives to buy electric cars
such as Nissan Motor Co.&#8217;s Leaf will &#8220;plunder&#8221; government
treasuries and do little to reverse pollution, a coalition of
German environmental groups said today. 
&#8220;A lot of money is going to be handed out to support
electric cars instead of implementing tougher carbon-dioxide
emissions and making gas and diesel cars more efficient,&#8221; said
Juergen Resch, who heads the Berlin-based environmental
organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe. 
Carmakers including Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG should
focus on boosting fuel efficiency and lowering carbon emissions
for vehicles installed with combustion motors, Resch said.
Electric cars often pollute more than gasoline or diesel
vehicles factoring in emissions at coal and natural gas power
plants, he said. 
Powering an electric car using the existing combination of
electricity sources in Germany, including coal and natural gas,
means such vehicles emit at least 120 grams of CO2 for each
kilometer driven, the environmental groups said. That&#8217;s more
than Volkswagen&#8217;s least-polluting Polo at 99 grams and Daimler&#8217;s
Smart car, which has a carbon output of 87 grams. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel is to meet May 3 with
representatives from the automobile and energy industries in
Berlin to discuss the future of electric mobility.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s legal
troubles may be contained to the U.S. as investors in Europe bet
regulation will lead to more stability for banks, said Gary
Jenkins, head of credit strategy at Evolution Securities Ltd. 
Bonds of U.K. banks have returned 0.28 percent since
Goldman was accused of defrauding investors 11 days ago,
compared with losses of 0.75 percent in the U.S., according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate
Index. Securities of New York-based Goldman gave up 3.45 percent
in the same period, making them the worst performers among the
biggest firms in the benchmark. 
&#8220;More intense regulation isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing,&#8221;
Jenkins said. &#8220;Bondholders are concerned about the ability of
banks to repay debt. The more stable financial firms are and the
more focus there is on a steady return over a business cycle,
the better for bondholders.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, became on April 16 the first major bank accused by the
Securities and Exchange Commission of fraud connected to the
collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Investors in the U.S.
have &#8220;woken up&#8221; to the Obama Administration&#8217;s determination to
target investment banks, while regulators in Europe have been
more passive, Jenkins said. 
&#8220;The Goldman Sachs SEC investigation is having much more
of an impact in the U.S. than in Europe,&#8221; he said. 
&#8216;Significant Upside&#8217; 
Investors in Europe are favoring bonds of Barclays Plc,
Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said
Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at LNG Capital LLP, a
London-based hedge fund he co-founded in 2006. Barclays bonds
have gained 0.08 percent since April 15, while debt of Lloyds
returned 0.41 percent, Bank of America data show. RBS bonds
gained 0.44 percent. Debt of ING Groep NV in Amsterdam was the
best bank performer globally, returning 0.65 percent. 
&#8220;There is significant upside in some of the European banks
as a result of the decimation they have taken over the past two
years,&#8221; Gargour said. &#8220;Systemic risks will be minimal for the
next few years and banks are sufficiently profitable in good
times to bear the burden of the proposed global bank tax.&#8221; 
The International Monetary Fund has recommended banks set
aside money to fund future bailouts. 
Bonds of the top five U.S. banks have all lost money for
investors since the SEC suit was filed. Fixed-income securities
of Morgan Stanley gave up 1.13 percent, Bank of America lost
0.72 percent, Citigroup Inc. lost 0.5 percent and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. lost 0.27 percent. 
A sovereign default by a country like Greece remains a risk
to financial firms in Europe, Evolution&#8217;s Jenkins said. European
banks had total claims on Greece including bonds and loans of
$193.1 billion as of Dec. 31, according to the Bank for
International Settlements. 
Lloyds said yesterday that its &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece and
Portugal isn&#8217;t material. RBS chairman Philip Hampton said his
firm has less than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) of Greece
debt.

Warren Buffett, who called Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. an &#8220;exceptional institution&#8221; when he invested
$5 billion in the firm, will have his biggest platform to
discuss the bank after it was sued for fraud by regulators and
pilloried in Congress. 
Buffett, who will host shareholders of his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. at the May 1 annual meeting, was a satisfied
Goldman Sachs client when he extended capital and credibility to
the firm during the credit crisis in 2008. Buffett has since
defended the bank amid public outrage about its pay and conduct,
drawing on a relationship that dates to a visit with a Goldman
Sachs executive in New York at the age of 10. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s more than 60 years of experience with Goldman
Sachs that&#8217;s talking,&#8221; said Jeff Matthews, author of
&#8220;Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Omaha&#8221; and founder of the
hedge fund Ram Partners LP. &#8220;Buffett is not going to be turning
around selling his Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
Buffett said people who feel cheated by the recession have
unfairly lashed out at Wall Street when regulators, mortgage
lenders and politicians should share the blame. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs
offering the apple,&#8221; Buffett said in a March 1 interview with
CNBC. 
The billionaire has &#8220;great confidence&#8221; in his investment,
according to Berkshire Director Thomas Murphy, who told 
Bloomberg Television that he spoke with Buffett after the  
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs on April 
16. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said 
he also spoke privately with Buffett after the lawsuit. 
Shareholder Questions 
Buffett will take about five hours of shareholder questions
at the meeting and, according to Murphy, should expect inquiries
about Goldman Sachs, which was accused of misleading clients on
the sale of mortgage-related investments. About 35,000 people
attended last year&#8217;s meeting at Omaha&#8217;s Qwest Center arena.
Buffett&#8217;s comments from the gathering and subsequent press
conference are read throughout the world. 
Buffett, a critic of Wall Street greed and corruption, has
supported a firm that&#8217;s been a lightning rod for criticism.
Public regard for Goldman Sachs plunged in the year and a half
since Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
bought preferred securities paying 10 percent interest. 
Berkshire makes $500 million a year in interest on the
Goldman Sachs perpetual preferred stock, which the bank may call
at any time by paying a 10 percent premium. The warrants Buffett
negotiated as part of the deal give Berkshire the option to buy
$5 billion of common stock for $115 a share. Berkshire&#8217;s paper
profit on the warrants was about $1.8 billion as of yesterday,
down from $3 billion before the SEC lawsuit was announced. 
Goldman Shares 
Goldman Sachs advanced $3.97, or 2.6 percent, to $157.01
yesterday in New York trading. The bank closed at $184.27 on
April 15. Berkshire rose $675 to $115,625. 
The transaction is reminiscent of a 1987 deal with Salomon
Inc. in which Buffett invested $700 million. 
Buffett was named interim chairman of Salomon in 1991 after
the firm was accused of misconduct in the Treasury debt auction
market, and he worked with regulators to restore the company&#8217;s
credibility. In testimony to Congress, he summarized his message
for Salomon employees: 
&#8220;Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding,&#8221;
Buffett said. &#8220;Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I
will be ruthless.&#8221; 
Senate Hearing 
Goldman Sachs executives endured more than 10 hours of
grilling before the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations on April 27 about their duty to clients and the
ethics of betting against the housing market as the bank sold
mortgage-linked securities. Michigan Democrat Carl Levin said he
was &#8220;troubled&#8221; that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to understand
conflicts of interest. 
Goldman Sachs has said the SEC suit is unfounded. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein told the committee. &#8220;The thing we are
selling to them is supposed to give them the risk they want.
They are not coming to us to represent what our views are.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs posted a record $13.4 billion profit in 2009,
a year after receiving $10 billion in a taxpayer bailout. It
repaid the funds with interest in June. 
Buffett told television interviewer Charlie Rose in
November that the bank didn&#8217;t need the bailout. As politicians
railed about bonuses, Buffett, the world&#8217;s third-richest person,
praised Blankfein and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying for
performance.&#8221; 
Finding a Target 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to expect vilification of banks,&#8221; Buffett
said in a January interview. &#8220;If I lost my job I&#8217;d be mad at
somebody, I&#8217;d probably be mad at everybody. And that&#8217;s human
nature. And it sometimes gets fanned by people to whom it&#8217;s to
their advantage to have a target.&#8221; 
The Goldman Sachs case is the SEC&#8217;s first contested lawsuit
against a major investment bank in more than a decade, and comes
as the regulator seeks to restore a reputation tarnished by its
failure to detect Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
Buffett, who has ridiculed investment bankers for the size
of their fees, relied on Goldman Sachs for some of his biggest
deals, including the $4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings
Inc. in 2008 and the $1.45 billion takeover of McLane Co. Those
deals were facilitated by Byron Trott, the former Goldman Sachs
managing director of whom Buffett said &#8220;I trust him
completely.&#8221; 
An Investing Icon 
At last year&#8217;s meeting, Buffett praised Wells Fargo  Co.
and dismissed the importance of government analysts who were
reviewing banks in an industrywide stress test. The San
Francisco-based bank jumped 44 percent the following week. 
&#8220;Warren Buffett is certainly an icon in terms of picking
the right companies and investing with a long-term strategy,&#8221;
said Jeff Resnick of Opinion Research Corp., a specialist in
brand and reputation consulting. A good reputation &#8220;will give
you a reservoir of goodwill among your most important
stakeholders.&#8221; 
Berkshire rose to first place this month in Harris
Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate reputations. Goldman
Sachs came in 56th out of 60. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s an important client as well as an investor,&#8221;
Blankfein said of Buffett in the April 27 Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for Warren.&#8221; 
Buffett said last year in Omaha that almost everyone
associated with finance, from bankers to regulators to insurers,
contributed to the crisis. 
&#8220;Some of it stemmed from greed, some from stupidity, some
from people saying the other guy was doing it,&#8221; Buffett said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may have
backed itself into a corner by speaking out quickly to counter
fraud claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In the two weeks since the SEC filed its lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs has released multiple written defenses, sent executives to
Capitol Hill for sworn testimony and put Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein on television to explain the firm&#8217;s conduct as
the housing market soured. While broadcasting its story, the New
York investment bank also has given regulators, lawmakers and
law enforcement agencies material to scour for contradictions
that could weaken its defense. 
SEC attorneys are already poring through the April 27
Senate testimony of Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old banker at
the center of the lawsuit, looking for any deviation from sworn
statements he made during the agency&#8217;s investigation, according
to a person familiar with the probe who declined to be
identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. 
&#8220;Going under oath and committing yourself before you have
any idea what kind of a case might be brought against you -- and
more particularly what the evidence in that case might be -- is
going to seriously curtail a defense lawyer&#8217;s ability to find
running room to defend you,&#8221; said Samuel Buell, a former
federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. 
Before the hearing, Tourre and Blankfein, 55, were
interviewed under oath by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
heads the panel, said he&#8217;s looking into whether they &#8220;tried to
fudge&#8221; their responses in the public hearing this week.
Blankfein will appear next week at the annual shareholders
meeting to answer questions related to the lawsuit. 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. 
Khuzami Meeting 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s chief of enforcement, said in a
closed meeting with Congressional staff on April 29 that it
wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate to discuss whether there are settlement
talks taking place, according to one person who attended and
spoke on condition of anonymity because the briefing was
private. Khuzami also declined to comment on why Tourre was the
only individual named in the lawsuit, the person said. 
The SEC&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit revolves around whether the firm
should have told investors in 2007 that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., helped pick the underlying securities for a collateralized
debt obligation -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t
accused of any wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Strategy 
While locking in testimony this early in the litigation
process posed risks, it was part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s strategy,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm&#8217;s
defense. Tourre&#8217;s public statements make it less likely that he
could change his story later and negotiate a lesser penalty with
the SEC in return for information that could be damaging to the
firm or other executives, the person said. 
Tourre, whose legal fees are paid by Goldman Sachs, said he
&#8220;categorically&#8221; denies the SEC&#8217;s allegations. He may have
testified to save his reputation and career, Buell said. 
&#8220;These guys&#8217; considerations aren&#8217;t just legal,&#8221; said
Buell. &#8220;They have to do with public relations, with reputation,
with their ability to continue to function the way they want to
in the business world.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock dropped 13 percent on the day the SEC
announced its case and declined 9.4 percent yesterday after
reports that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
the matter to determine whether to pursue a criminal fraud case. 
Along with two analyst downgrades, the scrutiny &#8220;puts the
pressure&#8221; on Goldman Sachs to try to settle sooner rather than
later, Matt McCormick, an analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in
Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8 billion, said yesterday in
a Bloomberg Television interview. 
In terms of public opinion, McCormick said, Goldman Sachs
has &#8220;already been condemned, the question is the price.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell in
New York trading after reports that federal prosecutors are
weighing criminal fraud charges against Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable firm and the stock was downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; at Bank of America Corp. 
Goldman Sachs dropped $15.04, or 9.4 percent, to $145.20 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares,
which doubled last year, have slumped 21 percent since April 15,
the day before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a civil lawsuit alleging the bank misled investors in
a mortgage-linked investment. 
Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
transactions by Goldman Sachs to determine whether to pursue a
criminal fraud case, according to two people familiar with the
matter. The review, which lawyers say is common in such a high-
profile case, is being done by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on
condition of anonymity. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings
power beyond what is discounted in the share price,&#8221; Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America, wrote in a report today. &#8220;However, it is very
difficult to see the shares making further progress until the
matter has been resolved.&#8221; 
Burden of Proof 
Bank of America also reduced its share-price estimate on
Goldman Sachs to $160 from $220, according to Moszkowski.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s equity analyst Matthew Albrecht cut his
recommendation on the shares today to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; and
reduced his price estimate to $140 from $180. 
The SEC suit said the bank created and sold collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages in early 2007, as
the U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles. The company called the SEC&#8217;s claims
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; 
The burden of proof in a criminal case would be higher than
in the SEC&#8217;s civil case. Criminal allegations have to be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Based on public reports about the SEC matter, a criminal
case may be difficult, said Douglas R. Jensen, an attorney with
Park  Jensen LLP in New York. The case appears &#8220;highly
complex&#8221; and Goldman Sachs would be able to make multiple
arguments in its defense, he said in an interview. 
Blankfein Speaks 
&#8220;In order to proceed criminally in a case, you need to
have very clear evidence of lying, cheating and stealing,&#8221; said
Jensen, a former deputy chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District of New York who
served on that office&#8217;s securities fraud task force. 
Goldman Sachs needs to be more transparent to stave off the
type of criticism the firm has recently endured, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein told National Public Radio. 
&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript dated
yesterday on NPR&#8217;s website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position
where activities seem to people as mysterious as they were at
the start of this crisis.&#8221; 
In an interview with CBS News earlier this week, he said,
&#8220;It is my belief that nothing unethical and nothing illegal has
happened, but I will tell you if I discovered something like
this, or any senior person at Goldman Sachs discovered illegal
or unethical behavior, we would eliminate that from the firm.&#8221; 
Goldman Annual Meeting 
Blankfein will be up for re-election as chairman when the
bank holds its annual shareholder meeting on May 7. Charles
Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested
$5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008, told CNBC today that he
admires Blankfein. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m favorably impressed by him,&#8221; Munger said in an
interview on the news channel. 
The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District
&#8220;pretty consistently&#8221; reviews SEC cases that are &#8220;higher
profile&#8221; such as those involving large dollar amounts or policy
issues, he said. The reviews may begin before the SEC files a
lawsuit. 
Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara, declined to comment. 
Full Cooperation 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the company would &#8220;fully cooperate with any
requests for information.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Given the recent focus on
the firm, we&#8217;re not surprised by the report of an inquiry.&#8221; 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation hasn&#8217;t opened a
criminal investigation, said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity and wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment publicly
on the matter. The Postal Inspection Service, which also could
investigate such cases, doesn&#8217;t have any open probes into
Goldman, said Tom Boyle, a spokesman for the agency in New York. 
Two former prosecutors for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said prosecutors
have their own investigators who may be examining the case
before determining whether to involve the FBI or postal
inspectors. The SEC may have provided documents and other
information to prosecutors gathered as part of its
investigation, allowing them to assess whether a criminal case
could be made, they said. 
Sixty-one House Democrats and one House Republican, led by
Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, sent a letter to
the Justice Department on April 23 asking Attorney General Eric
Holder to investigate Goldman Sachs, if the Justice Department
wasn&#8217;t already. The department will review the letter, Alisa
Finelli, a spokeswoman, said in an April 27 e-mail. 
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
trade and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued
Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president who helped create
the CDOs, known as Abacus.

Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, reported its largest profit increase in at
least a decade, exceeding analyst estimates, after recovering
economies around the world spurred increases in fuel demand. 
First-quarter net income more than doubled to $4.55
billion, or $2.27 a share, from $1.84 billion, or 92 cents, a
year earlier, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in
a statement. Excluding severance costs, per-share profit was
about $2.38, 43 cents higher than the average of 14 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson boosted oil and
natural-gas output by 4.5 percent with new wells from the Gulf
of Mexico to Australia. Watson is selling money-losing assets
and shifting capital to oil and natural-gas fields Chevron has
been working to bring online for years, said Edward Westlake, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. 
&#8220;Production was above expectations so it&#8217;s very hard to
shoot any holes in their story,&#8221; said Robbert Van Batenburg,
head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in New York. &#8220;As
long as they continue to bring new projects on line, it&#8217;s blue
skies ahead.&#8221; 
Worldwide demand for crude rose by 1.84 million barrels a
day during the first quarter, almost three times the growth rate
of the final three months of 2009, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Chevron fell 85 cents to $81.44 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock rose as
much as 1 percent after the earnings report was released this
morning. It has 19 buy and 6 hold ratings from analysts. 
Record Production 
Revenue jumped 33 percent to $48.2 billion, Chevron said.
The company&#8217;s oil and gas production increased to the equivalent
of 2.78 million barrels of crude a day, a company record, as new
wells started output in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Angola and the Gulf
of Mexico. 
Profit from oil and gas wells more than tripled to $4.72
billion as the prices the company was paid for crude and gas
surged 97 percent and 28 percent, respectively. 
Refining and chemicals earnings tumbled 74 percent to $196
million as higher crude prices squeezed margins on making
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 
Watson, 53, announced plans last month to reduce the
company&#8217;s refining workforce by 12 percent, sell Chevron&#8217;s only
remaining European refinery and shed other assets that aren&#8217;t
meeting internal profitability goals. 
Watson, who succeeded David O&#8217;Reilly as CEO on Jan. 1, is
contending with reduced access to some of the world&#8217;s biggest
remaining untapped oil fields. The refining restructuring
announced last month includes plans to sell more than 1,000
gasoline stations and 60 fuel-storage terminals. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 38 percent to
$6.3 billion.

Microsoft Corp., which some
analysts had predicted would make an offer for Palm Inc., won&#8217;t
bid after Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to acquire the maker of Pre
and Pixi phones this week. 
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, asked
whether the world&#8217;s largest software maker planned to make a
counteroffer, replied, &#8220;No we don&#8217;t.&#8221; Ballmer, who was
speaking at a conference in Mexico City, said the company also
will continue to invest in tablet-computer devices. 
Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is used in
Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s smartphones and tablet computers, stands to
lose if the computer maker replaces Windows with Palm&#8217;s
software. Earlier this year, Eric Risley, founder of Architect
Partners, a Menlo Park, California-based merger-and-acquisition
advisory firm, suggested that Microsoft could be a suitor for
Palm. 
Hewlett-Packard has canceled plans for a Windows-based
tablet, expected to go on sale later this year, TechCrunch
reported yesterday, citing a person it didn&#8217;t name. 
Microsoft spokesman Bill Cox declined to comment on
specific products today. &#8220;H-P is a strategic partner of
Microsoft and will continue to be,&#8221; he said. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 47 cents to
$30.53 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needs to
be more transparent to stave off the type of criticism the firm
has recently endured, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
told National Public Radio. 
&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript on NPR&#8217;s
website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position where activities
seem to people as mysterious as they were at the start of this
crisis.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which generates more trading revenue than
any other Wall Street firm, faces a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil fraud lawsuit over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security and is under scrutiny by federal criminal
prosecutors. Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
tried to defend the firm&#8217;s actions this week when he was
interrogated by a U.S. Senate subcommittee. 
&#8220;Someone like Goldman Sachs has never been in the consumer
business and never really had to get out and explain to the
public at large how we do our business,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to the transcript, dated yesterday. &#8220;And now I&#8217;m
afraid it&#8217;s become very, very important for us to do that.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds, played
a role in creating the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, Blankfein told NPR. 
&#8216;Contributed to Crisis&#8217; 
&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So,
for example, Goldman Sachs did transactions for companies that
involved lending them a lot of money, maybe too much money. We
financed real estate that was probably overleveraged.&#8221; 
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 8.4 percent, or $13.42, to
$146.82 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock is down about 20 percent since April 15, the
day before the SEC filed suit. 
In the future, Blankfein said, Goldman Sachs and the
industry as a whole should be better at spotting bubbles in the
markets if they occur and better at absorbing the effects of
those bubbles. 
&#8220;If institutions can&#8217;t absorb it and don&#8217;t have the
financial wherewithal to deal with the problems as they arise,
at least we have to have a system in place where financial
systems can be put out of business in a way that doesn&#8217;t
jeopardize the entire system by creating system risk,&#8221;
Blankfein added, according to the transcript. 
Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s allegations and that it
will &#8220;fully cooperate&#8221; with any requests for information from
federal prosecutors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as federal prosecutors
investigate the firm to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs increased the most
since the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil lawsuit
filing on April 16, as a federal review begins by the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said two people familiar with the matter,
who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bank of America Corp. cut its rating on the shares to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing the probe. 
Credit swaps on Goldman Sachs climbed 25.8 basis points to
157.4 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. Swaps on other
banks, including Morgan Stanley to Bank of America, also rose. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
rose 0.98 basis point to a mid-price of 90.31 basis points as of
10:47 a.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index
typically falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates. 
Swaps on Morgan Stanley rose 10.2 basis points to 162.7
basis points, CMA prices show. Contracts on Bank of America
climbed 8.3 basis points to 135.7, and swaps on JPMorgan Chase 
Co. increased 8 basis points to 82.6. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Goldman also recruited Albert Sagiryan, a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. vice president for debt origination in Moscow, according to
the people, who declined to be identified before the new
positions have been made official. 
Wall Street firms are competing for bankers as Russia&#8217;s
economy recovers from its worst contraction on record. Companies
will probably sell a record 1 trillion rubles ($34 billion) of
domestic bonds this year, according to Trust Investment Bank and
ING Groep NV. Both UBS AG and Renaissance Capital forecast
Russian companies will raise $20 billion in initial public
offerings. 
Goldman hired Christopher Barter to head its Russian office
on Jan. 29 and recruited former OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Tav Morgan to improve its commodities
business in the former Soviet Union. 
Hiring Spree 
Morgan Stanley hired Gergely Voros and Dmitry Avdeev as co-
heads of investment banking for Russia, replacing Yan Tavrovsky,
who left the bank earlier this year, according to a statement
April 27. Avdeev will resign as chief financial officer of
Russian oilfield service company Integra Group to return to
Morgan Stanley while Voros is London-based head of emerging
equity capital markets at the bank. 
Credit Suisse recruited five fixed-income specialists last
month, including three from Deutsche Bank AG, while Renaissance
Capital appointed Credit Suisse&#8217;s Nikolai Yukovich to run its
emerging-markets currency team. Otkritie Financial Corp., a
local brokerage part-owned by VTB Group, in March took on 18
people for its new debt and currency market units. 
Goldman Sachs was the 10th biggest arranger of Eurobonds
for Russian companies in 2007-2009, organizing sales by OAO
Gazprom, OAO Transneft and Russian Agricultural Bank, according
to Bloomberg data. The company missed out on winning a role on
Russia&#8217;s first international bond sale this month since 1989
after making the shortlist of 22 banks. 
Goldman declined to comment and Djumaliev and Sagiryan
could not be reached for comment. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named
ICICI Bank Ltd.&#8217;s Sonjoy Chatterjee as managing director and co-
chief executive officer of its Indian operations. 
L. Brooks Entwistle, who has helmed operations in India for
the last four years, will oversee the Indian unit with
Chatterjee, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
statement today. 
The U.S. lender, which offers investment banking and
research services in India, is seeking a license for commercial
banking in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. 
Goldman Sachs ranks 16th in managing share sales in India
this year, lagging behind rivals such as Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley, according to Bloomberg data. On advising clients
on mergers and acquisitions, it ranks 11th, behind Barclays
Plc&#8217;s investment bank and Standard Chartered Plc, the data show. 
ICICI Bank, based in Mumbai, ranked 11th on managing
share sales and wasn&#8217;t among the top 20 banks in takeover
advisory, the data show. Chatterjee had been an executive
director at the company since 1997. 
India&#8217;s second-largest lender appointed Rajiv Sabharwal to
the board, according to a filing from the Mumbai-based bank to

There is &#8220;no guarantee&#8221; the U.K.
will retain its AAA credit rating and the election campaign has
revealed little about what the next government will do to cut
the budget deficit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
With a U.K. election next week, Goldman Sachs economists
Ben Broadbent and Adrian Paul said the U.K.&#8217;s prospects for
fiscal retrenchment, economic growth and interest rates look a
&#8220;little better&#8221; in general than Spain&#8217;s. Having a free-
floating exchange rate will also benefit the U.K., they said. 
&#8220;While that probably helps to explain why the U.K. has
retained its AAA so far, it is no guarantee that it will over
the future,&#8221; the London-based economists wrote in a note to
clients late yesterday. &#8220;All three rating agencies have
expressed concern about the existing government&#8217;s fiscal plans
and the election campaign has brought us precious little clarity
about what the next government will do.&#8221; 
The U.K. ran a budget deficit of 11.5 percent of gross
domestic product last year and has a government debt of 68.1
percent of GDP, according to the EU&#8217;s statistics office.

Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said a &#8220;callousness&#8221;
toward clients demonstrated in some e-mails released to the
public this week is unacceptable and doesn&#8217;t represent the firm. 
&#8220;There were some e-mails where some people were projecting
I would say, at best indifference, and at worst a callousness,&#8221;
Blankfein, 55, said in an interview on the &#8220;Charlie Rose&#8221;
television show last night, according to a transcript. While he
said those e-mails aren&#8217;t representative of the firm, &#8220;it&#8217;s
inexcusable if 10 people think that way or thought that way.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street firm that generates more
trading revenue than any other, has lost 21 percent of its
market value since it was sued on April 16 by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security. It is also under criminal investigation by
federal prosecutors, said two people familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;The firm is guiltless and this is a big preoccupation for
me and a big preoccupation for our management group,&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. 
Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
defended the firm&#8217;s actions this week under interrogation from a
U.S. Senate subcommittee, which released 901 pages of documents
including e-mail that showed employees disparaging securities
they were offering to clients. 
Most of the complex derivatives the firm developed and
traded had a &#8220;social utility,&#8221; he said, while others may have
gone too far. 
&#8216;Hindsight&#8217; Regrets 
&#8220;If the issuants themselves are too complicated, become
too illiquid as it turns out that they were, notwithstanding the
purpose you may say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s not do those things,&#8217;&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So in hindsight I wish we
had not done some of those things.&#8221; 
The stock fell 9.4 percent yesterday to $145.20, in New
York trading, its biggest drop since the SEC brought the suit on
April 16. The company has lost $21 billion in market value since
the case was filed. 
Blankfein said Goldman Sachs will survive and &#8220;thrive&#8221; in
the future. He said he would step down if his leadership damaged
the firm, calling that scenario unlikely. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here,&#8221; he said, according to the transcript.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my expectation and that&#8217;s my duty.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs must improve communication with the public,
Blankfein said. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge challenge, I would just say it&#8217;s my
deficiency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t exist in the current state
that we&#8217;re in and we understand that. So we have a lot of work
to do.&#8221; 
Stunning News 
News of the SEC suit came as a shock, Blankfein said. 
&#8220;It was in the middle of the morning, it was stunning,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I saw it over the screen. I read it, and my -- it
just -- my stomach turned over. I couldn&#8217;t -- I was stunned.&#8221; 
Blankfein defended the role that Goldman Sachs, and Wall
Street as a whole, plays in making markets. 
&#8220;You could call it a casino, but if it is, it&#8217;s a very
socially important casino,&#8221; he said. 
On congressional efforts to strengthen financial
regulation, Blankfein said he supports many aspects of the bill
proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
The so-called Volcker Rule, which would require banks to exit
the business of trading for their own account, or proprietary
trading, would eliminate about 10 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
revenue, Blankfein said. 
&#8220;There are aspects of the Volcker rule that go too far,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I work very hard for the 10 percent of our revenue.&#8221; 
In an interview to be aired tomorrow on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed
Zakaria GPS,&#8221; Blankfein said parts of the Volcker rule &#8220;are
warranted&#8221; and he &#8221;could&#8221; support them. 
&#8220;If it makes institutions safer, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But if it makes institutions forgo revenue opportunities, that
fact by itself is bad.&#8221; 
Contributing to Crisis 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds,
inadvertently helped cause the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, Blankfein said in an interview with National
Public Radio on April 29. 
&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein told NPR, according to a transcript of
that interview. &#8220;So, for example, Goldman Sachs did
transactions for companies that involved lending them a lot of
money, maybe too much money. We financed real estate that was
probably overleveraged.&#8221; 
Blankfein told CNN the firm must &#8220;regain the trust of the
public&#8221; to survive. &#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to a transcript of the interview. &#8220;We can&#8217;t survive
without people thinking well of us.&#8221; 
In the CNN interview, Blankfein also said former Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson called him during the financial crisis
and that Paulson was being &#8220;very, very careful to be
appropriate.&#8221; 
Blankfein said, &#8220;the conversations would be &#8216;What are you
seeing? What are you hearing? What are your clients saying? How
are the markets?&#8217;&#8221; 
Paulson had been head of Goldman Sachs before going to the
Treasury Department. Paulson isn&#8217;t connected to the hedge fund
by the same name.

Johnson  Johnson is recalling some
liquid infant&#8217;s and children&#8217;s pain relievers and allergy
medicine because the drugs&#8217; quality and potency may be unsafe. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement
JJ&#8217;s McNeil Consumer Healthcare is voluntarily recalling some
liquid Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl because of
&#8220;manufacturing deficiencies&#8221; that could affect quality, purity
or potency of the drugs. 
McNeil said in a separate statement the recall involves
over-the-counter infant and children&#8217;s drops and liquid Tylenol,
Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl in sizes ranging from 0.5 ounces (14
milliliters) to 4 ounces. Some of the products may have more of
the active drug, while others may have inactive ingredients that
didn&#8217;t meet standards or may contain small particles, the
drugmaker said. 
The New Brunswick-based company said the likelihood of any
serious reactions is &#8220;remote,&#8221; although it urged consumers who
have the products not to use them. 
Johnson  Johnson shares fell 71 cents yesterday to $64.30

transcript of the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t survive without people thinking well of us.&#8221; 
The firm is the target of a Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit that revolves around whether it should have
told investors that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., helped select
the underlying securities for a collateralized debt obligation
and then bet against it. Paulson  Co. wasn&#8217;t accused of any
wrongdoing in the matter, which dates back to 2007. 
In the interview, Blankfein said &#8220;I could&#8221; support the
Volcker rule, which would place restrictions on investments

proposal, by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, &#8220;are
warranted.&#8221;

&#8220;We were a lender. We lent money to companies&#8221; and &#8220;real

General Growth Properties Inc. will
support a revised financing proposal led by Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. in bankruptcy court after receiving a new
takeover bid from rival mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. 
Brookfield and its partners, Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LP, made a proposal
with &#8220;significantly enhanced terms&#8221; over the group&#8217;s original
investment agreement, Chicago-based General Growth said in court
documents filed in Manhattan today. General Growth plans to move
forward with the Brookfield group even as it reviews a &#8220;whole
company&#8221; bid received yesterday from Simon, the filing said. 
Simon offered about $6 billion to take over General Growth
and said it would pay down about $7 billion of unsecured debt, a
person with knowledge of the new bid said. The Indianapolis-
based company will drop its offer should the Brookfield group
receive warrants that will be issued if its plan is approved by
the bankruptcy court, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the details of the new offer aren&#8217;t yet public. 
General Growth is scheduled to go before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan May 5 to seek approval of the
Brookfield-led plan. Simon, spurned in a $10 billion takeover
offer for its biggest rival in February, had previously offered
to match the terms of Brookfield&#8217;s proposal while omitting a
provision that would require General Growth to issue stock
warrants. 
&#8216;One-Horse Race&#8217; 
&#8220;General Growth has concluded that accepting a minority
investment from Simon Property Group -- even one without the
warrants -- would likely deter other parties from putting
together a competing proposal and overall create a one-horse
race,&#8221; lawyers for General Growth wrote in the filing. 
Les Morris, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based Simon, said
he had no comment. 
The latest Brookfield proposal has as much as $7 billion in
equity commitments -- $500 million more than the prior one --
and includes an optional backstop for $1.5 billion in debt
financing if the company asks for it, according to court
documents. 
General Growth&#8217;s board favors the Brookfield deal because
it will foster more competitive bidding, including the potential
sale of the company before or after its exit from bankruptcy,
the company&#8217;s lawyers wrote. 
Warrant Changes 
Under the new plan, Brookfield and its partners would get
40 percent of the warrants they&#8217;re seeking once their proposal
is approved by the court. They would receive 20 percent more on
July 12, and the remainder over the course of their commitment
to General Growth. Staggering the warrants would lower the extra
price another bidder, such as Simon, would have to pay should it
make an offer for the company. 
Brookfield and its partners also agreed to increase the
strike price of their warrants. Once General Growth emerges from
bankruptcy, they will have warrants to buy shares of a newly
formed General Growth Properties at $10.50 each, up from $10
under the previous plan. 
Simon estimates the 120 million warrants could cost General
Growth shareholders $895 million, while General Growth has put
their value at about $519 million. Simon Chief Executive Officer
David Simon said last week that the warrants would make General
Growth &#8220;too expensive&#8221; to purchase. 
New Bid 
Under Simon&#8217;s new offer, the company would pay $13.25
a share for the new General Growth Properties -- $10 in Simon
stock, and $3.25 in cash -- and would back-stop the $5-a-share
offering for a company to be spun off, General Growth
Opportunities, said the person familiar with the plan.&#160;Simon
also would pay down about $7 billion in unsecured General Growth
debt and assume more than $20 billion of mortgages, the person
said.
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Simon doesn&#8217;t plan to make any more offers for General
Growth should its latest one be turned down, the person said. 
Brookfield is seeking so-called stalking horse status with
its bid, making it the first to set a value for General Growth. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest

Disney, owner of ESPN, the ABC broadcast network and Disney

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. should
replace its top executives because they failed to understand the
politics of the financial crisis and mishandled regulators&#8217;
claims of fraud against the firm, according to Richard Bove, an
analyst at Rochdale Securities. 
&#8220;Goldman is going to have to pay a high price for its
ineptitude,&#8221; Bove wrote in a note to investors yesterday. &#8220;Its
shareholders already have.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs lost 21 percent of its value on the New York
Stock Exchange in two weeks after the company was sued on April
16 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said
the New York-based company misled investors in a mortgage-linked
investment. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the
matter, people familiar with the matter said last week, and
Goldman Sachs executives were grilled by a U.S. Senate panel. 
Senior management failed to understand that the government
has chosen to make Goldman Sachs &#8220;an example of all of the
evils in the financial system that caused the &#8216;Great
Recession,&#8217;&#8221; Bove wrote. The company behaved defensively and
with technical arguments, rather than proactively by redefining
the debate and talking about the service that Goldman Sachs
provides to the country, according to Bove. 
&#8220;It should have understood the size and enormity of the
forces being brought against it,&#8221; Bove wrote. &#8220;It did not.
Thus, its responses were weak and ineffectual.&#8221; 
$1 Billion Settlement 
Bove wrote that he expects &#8220;high-level executives are
going to have to be removed from their positions both in the
management suite and from the board of directors.&#8221; He also
expects that the firm will pay a fine of at least $1 billion to
settle the SEC&#8217;s suit and will need to replace its legal team
with one that has greater &#8220;Washington know-how.&#8221; Finally, he
expects the firm will develop a new mission statement. 
Still, Bove said he doesn&#8217;t advocate selling Goldman Sachs
stock. 
&#8220;Despite its political naivet&#233;, it is still the best
trading company in the world and the world needs to trade,&#8221;
Bove wrote. 
The shares, down 11 percent this year, rose $4.30, or 3
percent, to $149.50 at 4 p.m.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., buffeted by
a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and a 21 percent decline in market value, is in talks to hire
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its
legal team, said a person briefed on the discussions. 
The talks are likely to lead to an agreement to hire the
firm, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
negotiations are confidential. The intention is to supplement,
not replace, the company&#8217;s current legal advisers including
Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, the person said. 
Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, is seeking additional legal advice as it faces
issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
week, according to the person. Federal prosecutors are also
investigating the firm&#8217;s activities in the area, people familiar
with the matter said last week. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Madelaine Miller, a spokeswoman for
Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s move to hire Paul, Weiss would echo a
similar decision made last year by Bank of America Corp. in
litigation with the SEC in federal court. The bank, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, hired Paul, Weiss to augment a legal
team led by Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton LLP. 
Citigroup, AIG, Spitzer 
Paul, Weiss has also advised clients including Citigroup
Inc., American International Group Inc., former New York
Governor Eliot Spitzer and former vice presidential aide Lewis
&#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby. 
Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said first-quarter profit rose more than analysts
estimated as products added from the acquisition of Wyeth
overcame costs from the U.S. health overhaul. The shares gained. 
Profit excluding certain items was 60 cents a share,
beating the 53 cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income decreased 26 percent to $2.03 billion, or
25 cents a share, from $2.73 billion, or 40 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. 
Pfizer counts the pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and the
depression pill Effexor among the medicines gained in its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth, completed in October. Products from
Wyeth contributed more than $3 billion to Pfizer&#8217;s sales in the
quarter. The health-care law, enacted in March, cut revenue for
the period by $56 million, the company said. 
&#8220;Results came in better than expected, both from slightly
higher sales -- about 1 percent more than we were looking for --
and from cost saves,&#8221; Joel Levington, managing director of
corporate credit for Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in
New York, said in an e-mail. 
Pfizer increased 35 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $17.26 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest gain among companies in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The shares have lost 5.1 percent this year.

Walt Disney Co. said owners of Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad played more than 1.5 million episodes of ABC
television shows since the computer went on sale. 
More than 400,000 copies of the free ABC player have been
downloaded since April 3, Burbank, California-based Disney said
today in an e-mailed statement announcing additional features.
Free shows are sponsored by advertisers. Others are for sale
from the Apple&#8217;s iTunes store, Disney said. 
The world&#8217;s biggest media company is seeking new ways to
deliver TV shows as viewers shift to the Internet and video
games for entertainment. Disney was the first to sell
commercial-free TV shows on the iTunes media store and was the
first to provide ad-supported shows at the ABC website. Disney
is also an investor in the Hulu.com video site with News Corp.&#8217;s
Fox and General Electric Co.&#8217;s NBC. 
Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said yesterday
1 million iPad tablet computers were sold in April after the
device&#8217;s release, outpacing the original iPhone. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs is Disney&#8217;s largest individual
shareholder. 
The new version of ABC&#8217;s player software released today
supports new iPads with 3G wireless Internet and improves the
rewind and fast-forward functions, Disney said. 
Disney fell 85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.72 at 1:51
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Before today
the shares had climbed 16 percent this year. 
Apple slid $6.88, or 2.6 percent, to $259.47 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market trading and had gained 26 percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s execution
and clearing unit agreed to pay NYSE Euronext and the Securities
and Exchange Commission $450,000 to settle allegations it broke
rules governing short sales on U.S. stocks because of a
bookkeeping error. 
Goldman Sachs was censured for violating the SEC&#8217;s
Regulation SHO, which sets rules for handling bearish trades in
equities. The infractions, which are unrelated to the SEC&#8217;s
April 16 mortgage-related fraud suit against the world&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank, involved requirements implemented in
September 2008 to reduce naked short selling, in which firms
sell stock short without intending to borrow the shares required
to complete their obligations. 
An emergency SEC rule implemented after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s collapse in September 2008 forced brokers to
close short sales that didn&#8217;t settle by the morning of the
fourth day after the trade. That regulation, called Rule 204T,
also imposed stricter requirements on subsequent short sales
when failures to deliver shares occurred. The rule was made
permanent in July 2009. 
Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP &#8220;initially responded
to the rule by implementing procedures that were inadequate in
that they relied too heavily on individuals to perform manual
tasks and calculations, without sufficient oversight or
verification of accuracy,&#8221; the SEC said today. 
Updating a Spreadsheet 
The SEC said in its order that New York-based Goldman Sachs
failed to close out positions on Dec. 9, 2008, because an
employee in the firm&#8217;s operations department didn&#8217;t correctly
update a spreadsheet used to calculate market-maker obligations
related to short sales. While the company corrected the mistake
after the market opened that day, two market makers on NYSE Arca
were unable to conduct business in two securities for three
days, the SEC said. 
The SEC also said Goldman Sachs failed to close out market-
maker positions on 46 occasions in 38 securities in January
2009. The commission said the failures resulted from the firm&#8217;s
&#8220;error in calculating its potential T+6 obligations,&#8221; referring
to the requirement that certain trades by market makers be
closed out by the morning of the sixth day after the transaction
occurred. These errors were the result of an employee
incorrectly removing a number used in calculations of short-sale
close-out obligations. 
&#8216;Processing Error&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
&#8220;This was the result of a manual processing error
following the changes in Rule 204T closeout requirements in
October 2008,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday said in a
statement. &#8220;There was no financial impact on our clients. We
now have improved, automated processes in place to avoid future
errors.&#8221; 
The company clears an average of 3 million trades a day,
said Canaday, who added that an automated system began in May
2009. 
NYSE said that from around Dec. 9, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009,
the Goldman Sachs unit failed about 68 times to close out
positions after short sales had failed to settle. Goldman Sachs
also didn&#8217;t notify customers that short sales in particular
stocks had failed to settle on time, the exchange said. 
Goldman Sachs improperly accepted about 385 short-sale
orders from customers over the same time period, NYSE said.
Existing failed positions in specific securities required the
firm to accept only short-sale orders in those stocks when the
shares had been arranged to be borrowed in advance, which it
didn&#8217;t do, NYSE said. The broker also failed to &#8220;reasonably
supervise and implement adequate controls&#8221; to ensure short-sale
rules were met from Sept. 24, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009, NYSE said.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S.
bank by assets, named Michele Colocci head of its merger-and-
acquisition group in Europe, replacing Dieter Turowski. 
Turowski, 44, will become global co-head of the natural-
resources advisory group in London alongside Carl Contiguglia,
who works in New York, said Morgan Stanley spokesman Michael Wang. Charlie Stewart, previously head of Latin American
investment banking, will replace Colocci as deputy head of
European investment banking, Wang said. 
Morgan Stanley was the top-ranked adviser on announced
European deals last year, advising on mergers worth at least
$187 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New
York-based firm ranks seventh this year with about $6.66 billion
of deals, the data show. The biggest transaction in 2010 was
advising flash-chip maker Numonyx Holdings BV on a $1.27 billion
offer from Micron Technology Inc. 
European MA activity plunged in April, which was the worst
month for takeovers in the region for 1 1/2 years, with the
total value of transactions dropping to $32.8 billion from
$106.6 billion in March, according to Bloomberg data. That&#8217;s the
lowest level since November 2008, two months after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
Colocci, 46, joined Morgan Stanley in 2004 from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and was most recently chairman of European MA, Wang
said. He holds a bachelor of economics from Williams College and
an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. 
Turowski, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, had been head
of European MA since early 2009, after replacing Gavin MacDonald. Before that Turowski was head of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
German MA team based in Frankfurt and he also worked in the
bank&#8217;s telecommunications, media and technology team, Wang said. 
Scott Matlock will become chairman of international MA in
London, Wang said. He was previously chairman of Asian mergers
and acquisitions in Hong Kong. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the appointments earlier
today on its website.

Highbridge Capital Management LLC, a
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s asset management unit,
hired David Frey of Stanfield Capital Partners LLC after that
company sold $5.15 billion of leveraged loans and other credits
to Carlyle Group. 
Frey, 43, started at New York-based Highbridge as a
managing director yesterday, according to a statement. Before
joining Stanfield as a portfolio manager in 2004, he oversaw
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans as an analyst at Katonah
Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management LP. 
&#8220;David&#8217;s expertise will enhance our existing loan
activities and further strengthen our ability to serve
investors,&#8221; Scott Kapnick, chief executive officer of
Highbridge Principal Strategies, said in the statement. 
After earning a master&#8217;s of business administration at
Columbia University in 1993, Frey joined Morgan Stanley. As a
principal in the investment banking unit, he managed new issue
transactions including high-yield, high-risk loans and bonds,
bridge financing, convertible and initial public offerings. 
Frey is a board vice chairman of the Loan Syndications and
Trading Association, a New York-based trade group. 
Highbridge, founded in 1992, has about $21 billion of
assets under management, according to the statement. The
Principal Strategies unit manages about $4 billion in mezzanine
debt, loans, public credit securities and growth equity, the
firm said. 
Carlyle, the Washington-based private equity firm, last
week won an auction to buy management contracts on $4.2 billion
of loans, which are packaged inside collateralized debt
obligations, and $950 million of managed accounts containing
similar securities from Stanfield in a bid to capitalize on a
recovery in loan prices and to expand its $13 billion of credit
investments.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s employee
morale remains good and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
received a standing ovation from partners at an April 20
earnings call, analyst Brad Hintz told clients. 
According to the firm, &#8220;employees are pulling together
like a team under pressure,&#8221; Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today after a
meeting with five senior executives at Goldman Sachs. &#8220;The
partnership has closed ranks, too, and at Goldman&#8217;s April 20,
2010, managing directors earnings call, Lloyd Blankfein received
a standing ovation from his partners.&#8221; 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New
York-based firm on April 16, and a Senate panel grilled
executives including Blankfein on April 27. Federal prosecutors
also are investigating the firm, people familiar with the matter
said last week. Analyst Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities LLC
said May 2 the firm&#8217;s top executives should be replaced for
mishandling the financial crisis and fraud claims. 
Hintz, who rates Goldman Sachs stock &#8220;outperform,&#8221; wrote
his note following an April 30 meeting with Goldman Sachs
President Gary Cohn, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Co-
Head of Investment Banking David Solomon, as well as Harvey Schwartz and David Heller, two of the co-heads of the securities
division. 
Stock Reaction 
Goldman Sachs stock dropped 21 percent from its close on
April 15, the day before the SEC filed charges, and its close on
April 30, the day after reports that federal prosecutors are
investigating the company. The stock rose $4.30, or 3 percent,
to $149.50 yesterday, and traded at $148.58 at 9:48 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Hintz is predicting the
stock will reach $210. 
The executives told Hintz that so far they&#8217;ve seen &#8220;no
degradation&#8221; of their client business, although clients keep
asking &#8220;when is this going to stop,&#8221; Hintz wrote. Hintz added
that the SEC case may continue for &#8220;quite a while&#8221; because the
firm doesn&#8217;t want to admit to a violation. 
Goldman Sachs management confirmed to Hintz that Monday
April 19, the first business day after the SEC case was filed,
was the firm&#8217;s largest day for equity commissions so far this
year, Hintz wrote. 
&#8220;Admittedly, Goldman Sachs has incurred reputation damage
and may suffer client fallout due to this case,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
&#8220;It is arguably difficult for a portfolio manager to buy or own
GS in an ERISA portfolio, a separately managed account or in a
mutual fund due to the current public outrage against the
firm.&#8221; ERISA refers to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974. 
Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed that
Blankfein got a standing ovation. Robinson declined to comment
on the rest of Hintz&#8217;s note. 
New Regulations 
The uncertainty of new regulations is the &#8220;greatest
strategic challenge facing Goldman Sachs today,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
Viniar said that the firm is &#8220;war-gaming a bunch of scenarios&#8221;
to prepare for different potential regulatory changes, Hintz
said. 
The firm estimates that about 75 percent to 80 percent of
derivatives that are currently traded over the counter will move
on to exchanges as the result of new regulation, Hintz said. The
rest are the &#8220;highly profitable, tailored segment&#8221; of the
business that will, under the current version of the Senate
bill, have to be originated outside of the company&#8217;s regulated
bank subsidiary, Hintz said. 
&#8220;This would force banks to move their fixed income
derivatives books from the bank subsidiary (that is FDIC
protected and has access to the Fed window) to a new separately
capitalized (and lower rated) derivatives subsidiary that would
likely be guaranteed by the bank holding company,&#8221; Hintz wrote.
&#8220;Goldman already operates its OTC fixed-income derivatives book
out of such a subsidiary and would not have to use new capital
to support this subsidiary.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is also planning a &#8220;fair amount of hiring&#8221;
in every part of its trading business this year, Hintz wrote.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. apologized after
James Glassman, a senior economist at the bank, said members of
the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showed
ignorance of market economics. 
&#8220;The report is from a single economist and does not
reflect the views of our firm,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman
Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4 statement. &#8220;We disagree
with his characterizations, and we&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; 
Glassman, according to a copy of his May 3 note on the
Huffington Post&#8217;s website, criticized the &#8220;low level of
economic literacy&#8221; shown as the panel, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current and former executives from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. on April 27. The panel examined the bank&#8217;s duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market
while selling mortgage-linked securities. 
&#8220;The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while,&#8221; Glassman wrote, according to the note. &#8220;Now that the
financial reform debate is in the final innings, it&#8217;s time for
the grownups to step in.&#8221; 
In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan. The note included a graph
depicting the state&#8217;s employment decline since 2000 compared
with that of other states, which was titled &#8220;People who live in
glass houses shouldn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221; Levin, a Democrat who was
not named in the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. 
Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said the lawmaker
didn&#8217;t plan to issue a statement. Glassman didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment after normal business hours. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment today. 
The Senate is debating a sweeping rewrite of rules
governing Wall Street, intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis that led the U.S. to extend $700 billion in
taxpayer funds to firms including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
Several senators said evidence presented at the April 27 hearing
supported the case for Congress to pass the legislation.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was late in
notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that
trader Fabrice Tourre might be sued for fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar
with the matter. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t update Finra on Tourre&#8217;s status until
this week, more than two weeks after the SEC filed a lawsuit
against him and the firm for allegedly misleading investors
about a mortgage-linked security, the people said. Under Finra&#8217;s
rules, Goldman Sachs should have updated Tourre&#8217;s file within 30
days of his receiving a so-called Wells notice from the SEC last
year. 
Penalties for failing to update Finra can include censure,
fines, suspension or expulsion from the brokerage industry. In
2004, Finra&#8217;s predecessor organization, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, fined 29 firms more than $9.2 million for
more than 8,000 late disclosures of reportable information about
their brokers and prohibited two firms, Morgan Stanley and
Wachovia, from registering new brokers for five business days. 
Goldman Sachs and Tourre are contesting the SEC&#8217;s suit. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the lapse on its website
earlier today. Spokesmen for Finra and Goldman Sachs both
declined to comment.

Microsoft Corp. will start selling its
Kin mobile phones online tomorrow with Verizon Wireless, the
biggest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, as the software company tries
to take back ground in the fast-growing smartphone market. 
The Kin One will sell for $49.99 after a $100 rebate and a
two-year service contract, the companies said in a statement.
The Kin Two, with a larger screen and higher-resolution camera,
will cost $99.99. Both phones go on sale in stores on May 13. 
Microsoft is aiming to use the phones to regain momentum
against Google Inc. and Apple Inc. in the smartphone market.
Devices running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system fell to 7.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone market in the fourth
quarter, down from 12.5 percent a year earlier, according to ABI
Research. Apple&#8217;s iPhone and phones using Google&#8217;s Android
software gained, passing Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. 
The Kin phones are aimed at young mobile-phone users who
like to stay in touch with social networks. Customers will
listen to music through Microsoft&#8217;s Zune system and must sign up
for a Windows Live account to set up the device. 
&#8220;The stage of life and who these people are, they&#8217;re
exploring, sharing and trying to define themselves,&#8221; said Eric
Hermelee, product management director for Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
communications business. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to be authentic to the
brand.&#8221; 
Video Chats 
The company is working on improvements to its Windows Live
products, such as high-definition video chat services that
display social network updates, Brian Hall, general manager for
Microsoft Windows Live, said in an interview last month. 
The phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain and
the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. 
Microsoft dropped 28 cents to $29.85 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 4 p.m. New York time. The shares have declined 2.1
percent this year. New York-based Verizon Communications Inc.,
which co-owns the wireless company with Vodafone, fell 7 cents
to $28.68 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The Kins have slide-out keyboards and let users check
friends&#8217; messages and status updates on Facebook and Myspace
from their home screens. Customers will have to sign up for an
unlimited data contract for $29.99 a month, in addition to a
$39.99 calling plan, to use the phone, boosting Basking Ridge,
New Jersey-based Verizon&#8217;s sales. 
&#8216;Attractive&#8217; Pricing 
The price of the Kin phones may help draw customers, said
Michael Gartenberg, a partner at Altimeter Group. 
&#8220;The pricing of the devices is very attractive,&#8221; said
Gartenberg. &#8220;They&#8217;re competitive with feature phones that do an
awful lot less. The service fee might be much more palatable,
given the initial cost of acquisition is attractive.&#8221; 
Verizon is relying on data plan sales to maintain growth as
the market for mobile customers becomes saturated. There are
more than nine wireless devices for every 10 people in the U.S.,
according to the CTIA wireless industry association. 
Overall, average monthly bills for customers last quarter

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s credit
rating outlook was cut to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable&#8221; by Fitch
Ratings, which said legal actions and regulatory changes could
hurt the firm&#8217;s reputation and ability to earn money. 
The long- and short-term issuer default ratings on New
York-based Goldman Sachs were affirmed at A+ and F+, Fitch said
today in a statement. Fitch said it&#8217;s unlikely that the long-
term rating would be cut below the A category. A+ is the fifth-
highest rating given by Fitch. 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year,
was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
fraud last month and was subjected to a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week that questioned its practices in underwriting
and selling mortgage-linked securities. Federal prosecutors are
also investigating the company, people familiar with the
situation said last week. 
&#8220;The rating outlook revision to negative incorporates
recent legal developments and ongoing regulatory challenges that
could adversely impact Goldman&#8217;s reputation and revenue
generating capacity,&#8221; Fitch wrote in today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;For
financial services companies, particularly those dependent on
the capital markets, reputation is critically important.&#8221; 
Fitch also pointed to regulatory changes under
consideration, including higher capital requirements, central
clearing of derivatives, restricted proprietary trading and
investments, that could &#8220;challenge Goldman&#8217;s current business
model.&#8221; 
&#8220;Absent serious negative legal results, Fitch does not
envision any adverse outcome that would precipitate a downgrade
to Goldman&#8217;s IDR below the &#8216;A&#8217; rating category,&#8221; the statement
said. 
Fitch Ratings is one of the three biggest credit rating
companies. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Goldman Sachs at A1
-- the fifth highest rating -- with a negative outlook, while
Standard  Poor&#8217;s rates Goldman Sachs A -- the sixth-highest
level -- with a negative outlook. 
Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 60 cents to $150.05 as of
11:30 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock is down about 18 percent since April 15, the day before
the SEC filed suit.

Microsoft Corp. is finding some
software pirates remain &#8220;one step ahead&#8221; of its efforts to
clamp down on fake or corrupted programs, the company&#8217;s anti-
piracy enforcement chief said. 
The world&#8217;s largest software producer&#8217;s anti-piracy efforts
are hampered by programs that are difficult to distinguish from
genuine products, David Finn, associate general counsel for
anti-piracy, said by phone. That problem may be exacerbated by
the spread of cloud computing, whereby programs are hosted on
the Web rather than on users&#8217; hard drives, he said. 
The monetary value of unlicensed software worldwide grew by
5 percent to $50.2 billion in 2008, with the most widespread
piracy in countries including Armenia, Bangladesh, and Georgia,
according to data from Interactive Data Corp. and the Business
Software Alliance. Increases in theft are being driven by faster
growth of software in high-piracy emerging markets, they said. 
While Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has succeeded in
combating some groups, &#8220;unfortunately some of the other gangs
are one step ahead of us,&#8221; Finn said. &#8220;As they get smarter and
as the ways of avoiding detection get more elaborate, we have to
raise our game.&#8221; 
Last year, Microsoft joined software companies including
Symantec Corp. in asking the U.S. government to demand that
China curb software piracy. In 2006, the Chinese government
pledged to ensure that all government computers used only
genuine software, a promise the companies said had not yielded
many results. 
The rising popularity of cloud services will &#8220;make our job
tougher&#8221; as more programs are hosted and used exclusively
online, Finn said. Microsoft is competing with rivals including
Google Inc. to offer Internet-based email, word processing and
calendar software.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley are among 20 financial companies competing to manage
Coal India Ltd.&#8217;s initial public offering, in what may be the
nation&#8217;s largest first-time stock sale. 
Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Citigroup Inc. are also seeking the mandate, according to a
statement on the department of disinvestment&#8217;s website. Coal
India, the nation&#8217;s state-owned monopoly producer, may raise as
much as 130 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) in July, two
government officials said April 20. 
Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s second-biggest share sale
arranger, is competing for its first assignment managing a state
offering in India after the government said it will pay higher
fees. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government aims to raise
$9 billion in the year ending March 31 selling stock in one
company almost every month. 
&#8220;This deal is the one to be on if you want to make a
statement in Indian investment banking circles,&#8221; said
Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of equity at SMC Capitals Ltd. in
New Delhi. The amount Coal India aims to raise is &#8220;large and it
is expected to be a historic public issue for India.&#8221; 
Coal India&#8217;s IPO would surpass Reliance Power Ltd.&#8217;s 115.6
billion rupee offering in January 2008 as India&#8217;s biggest,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Sensex Surge 
The government said in January it may sell shares in 60
companies to shrink its budget deficit, after the key Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange jumped 81 percent in 2009,
the most in 18 years. 
Nomura Holdings Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, DSP Merrill Lynch
 Co, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities India Pvt. are
also scheduled to make presentations to the department today and
tomorrow, according to the statement. 
Enam Securities Pvt., India Infoline Ltd., IDFC Capital
Ltd., JM Financial Ltd., ICICI Securities Ltd., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. Ltd., Avendus Capital Pvt., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. are also competing. 
SJVN Ltd., the operator of India&#8217;s largest hydropower plant,
was the first IPO this fiscal year for the government. SJVN&#8217;s
sale was nine times oversubscribed in the institutional part and
three times in the retail portion, bringing &#8220;life back to
public sector issuances,&#8221; Thunuguntla said. It closed May 3. 
The government plans to appoint as many as six book-running
lead managers for Coal India&#8217;s IPO, it said in the release. Iron
ore miner NMDC Ltd., which raised 99.6 billion rupees in the
largest state share sale in 2010 so far, had six book runners.

Morgan Keegan  Co., the 26th-largest
underwriter of U.S. bonds, must repay an investor $1.12 million
plus $153,000 in attorney&#8217;s fees for auction-rate securities
bought in connection with a Jefferson County, Alabama, sewer
project, an arbitration panel ruled. 
The May 4 decision by a Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority panel in Atlanta resolves the first case to test
Morgan Keegan&#8217;s contention it shouldn&#8217;t have to repurchase
auction-rate securities connected with the Alabama deal, said
Kathy Ridley, a spokeswoman for the company. The project has
been tainted by the corruption conviction of Larry Langford, the
former Democratic chairman of the County Commission. 
Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan has yet to buy back
$165 million of auction-rate securities held by its clients,
including $50 million connected with Jefferson County, Ridley
said in a telephone interview today. 
The company&#8217;s clients held as much as $2.2 billion of the
bonds at one point, most of which was either redeemed by the
issuers or repurchased by Morgan Keegan. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Morgan Keegan
in July, alleging the closely held company didn&#8217;t tell customers
about growing risks in the auction-rate market from Nov. 1,
2007, to March 20, 2008, when it sold $1.2 billion worth of the
securities. The instruments became inaccessible when the $330
billion market collapsed in February 2008. That case is still
pending, Ridley said. 
Bond Refinancing 
Auction-rate securities were marketed as a near-cash
alternative that could be liquidated at sales typically held
every seven, 14 or 35 days. The market froze in 2008 when banks
that sold the securities stopped serving as buyers of last
resort at the auctions, causing the transactions to fail. 
A $3 billion refinancing of the sewer debt led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. in 2002 and 2003 nearly bankrupted the county during
the credit crisis. Officials had sought to lower borrowing costs
by issuing floating-rate bonds and entering into swaps through
which the county would pay a fixed rate in exchange for a
variable rate meant to cover the bonds. The financing fell apart
when the companies guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit
ratings, causing the interest rates on the debt to soar. 
&#8220;While we agree whole-heartedly that investors should
recover their lost investments in the auction-rate securities
issued by Jefferson County, Alabama, we strongly believe that
the burden of recovery appropriately lies with the underwriters
of these failed securities, namely JPMorgan, not Morgan
Keegan,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s press release states. 
Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment.

Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. may be
undervalued as U.S. Senate Democrats struggle to muster votes
for legislation to help merchants cut credit-card fees, Morgan
Stanley analyst Adam Frisch said. 
&#8220;The severity of the language in the proposed amendments,
in their current form, increases the potential for a 60-vote
approval requirement,&#8221; Frisch wrote today in a note to clients
before the companies&#8217; shares fell the most since October 2008.
&#8220;We would be buyers on weakness.&#8221; 
Three proposals by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of
Illinois could threaten more than $40 billion a year in
interchange or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees collected by card-issuing banks
including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. MasterCard and
San Francisco-based Visa set the rates. 
Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard fell yesterday
and today after Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, backed an amendment to the
financial industry overhaul bill that would let merchants offer
discounts for cash or a particular card brand, and allow
retailers to set maximum or minimum transaction amounts. 
MasterCard fell 3.2 percent to $230.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares tumbled as
much as 11 percent today when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged the most since 1987, before paring losses. Visa declined
4.1 percent to $82.92 after dropping as much as 12 percent. 
Earnings Surge 
MasterCard also declined as the euro slumped against the
dollar. Europe is MasterCard&#8217;s biggest market outside the U.S.
and the firm may face more competition there as banks plan to
create a rival payments network. Visa doesn&#8217;t process European
card transactions as that role is filled by London-based Visa
Europe Ltd., a separate company. 
In the past week, Visa Inc. and MasterCard said net income
surged in the quarter ended March 31 amid a rebound in card
spending and as more consumers worldwide switch from cash and
checks to plastic. Net income at MasterCard climbed 24 percent
to $455 million, while Visa&#8217;s increased 33 percent to $713
million. Both companies&#8217; results exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. 
&#8220;There has been very little, if anything, in Visa&#8217;s and
MasterCard&#8217;s results to justify the selloff,&#8221; Frisch said. 
The other amendments from Durbin would limit the amount
payment networks can charge for debit-card transactions and
mandate that the government receive the lowest interchange
rates, which average about 2 percent per transaction. Durbin has
said the U.S. is &#8220;a major user&#8221; of credit cards. 
Letter to Senators 
&#8220;There should be a fee associated with the use of credit
cards, but it has reached a point now of unreasonableness,&#8221;
Durbin said yesterday during debate on the overhaul bill. 
Merchants including convenience-store chain 7-Eleven Inc.
have complained to Congress that they are powerless to bargain
with Visa and MasterCard, calling them a duopoly. Finance-
industry groups including the Electronic Payments Coalition and
the American Bankers Association oppose Durbin&#8217;s proposals,
saying the measures would harm consumers, small businesses and
the economy. 
&#8220;Such amendments amount to express government price
setting of business-to-business transactions and would hurt the
ability of local banks to serve their communities,&#8221; the Bankers
Association said today in a letter to senators. &#8220;These
amendments would harm consumers by driving up the cost of credit
and by limiting the benefits consumers have come to expect.&#8221; 
Some state governments have crafted their own rules. 
Vermont&#8217;s senate unanimously approved a bill May 4 to let
merchants decline credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer
discounts for cash or other card brands. Republican Governor Jim Douglas hasn&#8217;t decided whether to veto the legislation, said his
spokesman, David Coriell. 
&#8220;He does have some concerns,&#8221; Coriell said yesterday.
&#8220;You certainly don&#8217;t want to discourage people in any way from
coming to the Green Mountains and going on a ski vacation
because we&#8217;ve passed some regulation that makes it harder for
them to spend their money.&#8221;

Rajat Gupta, the Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. director who is being investigated by U.S. authorities over
his links to Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam, had a
long-standing business relationship with the billionaire hedge
fund manager. 
Interviews, public records, lawsuits and regulatory filings
show a 13-year history of co-investing and other business
collaborations between Gupta, 61, the former worldwide head of
consulting firm McKinsey  Co., and Rajaratnam, 52, the central
figure in the Galleon insider trading probe. 
Rajaratnam has a stake in a fund managed by New Silk Route
NSR Partners LLC, founded by Gupta and three others in 2006 to
invest in South Asian companies, according to a New Silk Route
spokeswoman. The fund owns stakes in at least 11 Indian
companies, including cell phone tower operator Reliance Infratel
Ltd. and the Cafe Coffee Day chain. 
&#8220;Mr. Rajaratnam has had a well-known relationship with Mr.
Gupta for many years, and it is one that he is both proud and
fond of,&#8221; Rajaratnam&#8217;s spokesman, Jim McCarthy, said yesterday
in a statement. &#8220;Their association as investors has led to many
successful ventures around the world and made a large and
positive impact for a long list of worthy businesses and
charities. But just as important, they have always conducted
those efforts with integrity and diligent attention to sound,
ethical practices.&#8221;

James Glassman, a senior economist at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., said it was a mistake for him to call
members of a Senate panel ignorant and to call for &#8220;grownups to
step in&#8221; to the financial reform debate. 
&#8220;It was a stupid thing to do,&#8221; Glassman said today in an
interview after the New York-based bank apologized for his
remarks yesterday. &#8220;I fell into the same trap of getting
emotional about these issues, when what I meant by saying &#8216;the
grownups need to step in&#8217; was that we all need to cool down and
find some common ground.&#8221; 
Glassman, in a May 3 note to clients, criticized the &#8220;low
level of economic literacy&#8221; shown as the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, led by Senator Carl Levin, grilled current
and former executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on April 27.
The Senate is debating legislation aimed at restructuring
financial-system oversight to head off a future crisis,
including regulation of derivatives that could eliminate
billions of dollars of revenue from Wall Street firms. 
&#8220;There are political pressures on the bank that limit what
it can say about Congress,&#8221; said Richard Bove, a bank analyst
with Rochdale Securities who left Ladenburg Thalmann Financial
Services Inc. last year after a disagreement over settling a
defamation lawsuit against him. &#8220;There are significant
limitations on the freedom given to analysts to express their
opinions.&#8221; 
GOP Amendment 
Republicans filed an amendment today to remove language
from the bill that would require banks such as JPMorgan to wall
off their swaps-trading operations. Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told analysts last month that the bill would cost
the firm anywhere from &#8220;several hundred million to a couple
billion dollars.&#8221; 
President Barack Obama&#8217;s senior adviser, David Axelrod, and
National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers met with
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Dimon, and about 13 other
executives on April 6 in Washington and pressed them to stop
lobbying against the financial reform bill, people who attended
the meeting said last month. 
JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said in a May 4
statement that Glassman&#8217;s report &#8220;is from a single economist
and does not reflect the views of our firm. 
&#8220;We disagree with his characterizations, and we&#8217;re
sorry,&#8221; Zuccarelli said in the statement. 
&#8216;Public Face&#8217; 
Glassman, 63, said economists are often &#8220;the public face
of a company,&#8221; even though he doesn&#8217;t speak for the bank.
&#8220;They were right to distance from this and to issue an
apology,&#8221; he said. 
Analysts&#8217; controversial views have created problems for
their employers in the past. 
Bove was sued in July 2008 by BankAtlantic Bancorp, which
said he defamed the company by saying it might fail in a report
titled &#8220;Who is Next?&#8221; Bove said at the time that he left
Ladenburg because it was moving to settle the suit while Bove
thought it had no merit. The case is still outstanding. 
In 1990, analyst Marvin Roffman was fired by Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. after he expressed doubts about the future
of Donald Trump&#8217;s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, prompting
Trump to threaten a lawsuit. The Taj Mahal project was forced
into bankruptcy months after Roffman&#8217;s comments. 
Glassman said he has received positive responses from
colleagues in the financial industry to his note, which he said
reflects the frustration felt as Wall Street is criticized by
politicians and pundits for the housing collapse and financial
crisis. 
&#8216;Singled Out&#8217; 
&#8220;I understand the outrage and I understand why many people
in the industry feel we&#8217;re being unfairly singled out when there
is plenty of blame to go around,&#8221; Glassman said. &#8220;But Wall
Street was a part of the problem and bears some blame, and there
are things that need to be fixed.&#8221; 
Glassman said in the research note that the &#8220;ignorance&#8221;
shown by senators in the Goldman Sachs hearing is also plaguing
reform efforts. The present form of the legislation does little
to resolve the issue of banks being &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; and
rather focuses on issues that didn&#8217;t cause the crisis, he said
in the note. 
&#8220;The hearings exposed an unnerving ignorance of
fundamental principles of market economics by folks who have a
hand in remapping rules of finance that will be with us for a
while,&#8221; Glassman wrote in the note. &#8220;Now that the financial
reform debate is in the final innings, it&#8217;s time for the
grownups to step in.&#8221; 
Munger Impressed 
Not everyone shared Glassman&#8217;s view of the proceedings.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charles Munger said in an
interview on May 3 that he was impressed with the senators&#8217;
understanding of the issues involved. 
&#8220;I thought they were the best I&#8217;d ever seen under such
circumstances in my history of watching senators,&#8221; Munger said.
&#8220;I thought it was an unusually intelligent and aggressive bunch
of people.&#8221; 
In the note, Glassman discussed the economic troubles
facing the state of Michigan and included a graph depicting the
state&#8217;s employment decline since 2000 compared with that of
other states, which was titled &#8220;People who live in glass houses
shouldn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221; Levin, a Democrat who was not named in
the note, is the senior senator from Michigan. 
Glassman said today the note was &#8220;unfair&#8221; to the senators
and said his main concern is the unintended consequences that
could arise from quickly pushing a financial reform bill through
Congress. 
Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, said yesterday the
lawmaker didn&#8217;t plan to issue a statement. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, had no further comment yesterday.

General Motors Co. notes, the most
actively traded U.S. corporate bonds today, fell as investors
sell riskier credit amid concerns that Europe&#8217;s financial crisis
may broaden. 
The company&#8217;s defaulted 8.375 percent securities due in
2033 declined 1.75 cent to 33.25 cents on the dollar as of 11:19
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Detroit-
based GM restructured in bankruptcy last year. 
The automaker&#8217;s debt has fallen amid &#8220;a broad pullback
across the distressed market,&#8221; said Timothy Daileader, director
of research at Knight Capital Group Inc. in Greenwich,
Connecticut. High-yield bond spreads rose 23 basis points
relative to similar-maturity Treasuries yesterday, the most
since June 2009, to 591 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. 
GM bonds &#8220;are an easy sell for distressed accounts to
raise liquidity,&#8221; Daileader said. Those investors &#8220;have been
buyers of European bank paper, and that is directly affected by
the pullback in Europe.&#8221; 
High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. Distressed
companies are those in default or with yield spreads of more
than 10 percentage points, or 1,000 basis points.

A Pfizer Inc. unit won a re-trial of a
Pennsylvania lawsuit over its menopause drugs that ended in a
first jury&#8217;s award of $1.5 million in damages, the company said. 
A Philadelphia judge yesterday ruled lawyers for the
plaintiff, Merle Simon, must ask another jury to consider
whether Pfizer&#8217;s Pharmacia  Upjohn subsidiary hid the health
risks of its Provera hormone-replacement drug. In December, an
appeals court reinstated Simon&#8217;s original verdict after it was
thrown out by the trial court, giving the judge the option of
ordering a new trial. 
&#8220;We anticipate we have a good opportunity to win another
verdict on behalf of Mrs. Simon,&#8221; Jim Morris, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;We
intend to push forward with this case until justice is served.&#8221; 
More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats, and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by Upjohn. 
Wyeth later combined the two hormones in Prempro. The drugs
are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
in October. 
&#8216;Appropriate&#8217; New Trial 
 &#8220;We are pleased with the judge&#8217;s ruling as we believe a new
trial is appropriate given the facts of this case,&#8221; Chris Loder, Pfizer&#8217;s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today. 
A three-judge Superior Court panel on Dec. 31 found state
Judge Nitza Quinones Alejandro erred in finding Simon&#8217;s claims
were barred by Pennsylvania&#8217;s statute of limitations on
lawsuits. 
The panel noted it was &#8220;entirely unreasonable&#8221; to assume
women knew the links between hormone-replacement drugs and
breast cancer until the 2002 Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, made it
clear. The study found that women using menopause medicines have
a higher risk of breast cancer. 
The panel sent the case back to Alejandro so she could
decide whether Pfizer was entitled to a new trial, and in the
meantime, ordered the jury verdict reinstated, according to the
38-page ruling. 
The appeals court still must rule on whether to accept
Alejandro&#8217;s decision on the new trial. 
Morris said a new trial would reinstate Wyeth as a
defendant in the case. Jurors in the original case rejected
Simon&#8217;s claims that Wyeth&#8217;s menopause medicine was also a cause
of her breast cancer. 
The case is Simon v. Wyeth, 040604229, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia).

Electric vehicle makers Coda
Automotive Inc. and Fisker Automotive Inc. led a 68 percent
increase in venture capital investments in the clean technology
sector in the first quarter, according to Ernst  Young LLP. 
Venture capital firms invested $733.3 million in clean
technology companies during 72 financing rounds, outpacing the
11 percent gain in among all industries. Almost half went to
early stage financings, the biggest share for seed and first-
stage technology investments since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
&#8220;People are becoming more confident investing in new
technologies,&#8221; said Gil Forer, head of global clean technology
for Ernst  Young, which analyzed data compiled by Dow Jones
VentureSource. &#8220;The electrification of transportation is a huge
opportunity.&#8221; 
Coda Automotive, a Santa Monica, California-based
manufacturer of electric cars, received $100 million in funding
during the quarter to improve batteries and deliver the first
model to the U.S. this year. 
Fisker took in $93 million of venture capital, and last
month won a $528.7 million U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee
to manufacture a plug-in hybrid at a factory in Wilmington,
Delaware. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a significant amount of money moving into
cleantech this year from both government stimulus and private
capital firms,&#8221; Forer said yesterday in an interview. 
Solar manufacturer Solyndra Inc., based in Fremont,
California, received the most venture funds last year with $198
million, followed by $100 million each for car battery maker
A123 Systems Inc. and smart grid developers Silver Spring
Networks and Landis+Gyr AG.

Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Co.,
the drugmaker controlled by China&#8217;s wealthiest couple, jumped in
its trading debut, giving Goldman Sachs Group Inc. a 235-fold
paper return on its investment in the company. 
Hepalink, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the blood-thinner
heparin, climbed to 175.17 yuan on the Shenzhen stock exchange
from its initial public offer price of 148 yuan. Today&#8217;s 18
percent gain values Goldman&#8217;s stake, bought for $4.9 million in
2007, at more than $1 billion. 
The IPO price was the highest by any company in China,
helping Hepalink raise 5.9 billion yuan ($864 million) to expand
production capacity to supply clients including Paris-based
Sanofi-Aventis SA. The stock was one of three that started
trading in China today, with Shanghai Communications Technology
Development Co. surging 70 percent. 
Hepalink&#8217;s &#8220;IPO price is too high and its performance won&#8217;t
be good after the debut,&#8221; said Zhang Kun, a strategist at
Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai. &#8220;The IPO shares were
priced at a time when investors ramped up small-cap stocks on

The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China&#8217;s stock exchanges, fell 4.1 percent and the CSI 300 Index
declined 3.4 percent.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying the Mexican peso against the dollar, saying strengthening
growth in the Latin American country&#8217;s economy will help the
currency recover after an &#8220;irrational&#8221; sell-off. 
The peso added 0.7 percent to 12.9002 at 3:40 p.m. New York
time today and will advance 5.7 percent to 12.2 per dollar,
Fiona Lake, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note today.
The peso has dropped 4.6 percent versus the dollar this week,
its biggest decline since November 2008, on concern the European
debt crisis will derail the global economic rebound. 
&#8220;The global macro picture remains extremely supportive of
a clear pro-cyclical stance,&#8221; Lake said. &#8220;Markets have
displayed a certain degree of irrational behavior in recent
days, which suggests the related price action may have overshot.
The peso outlook has improved very significantly as growth has
strengthened rapidly.&#8221; 
Before this week&#8217;s decline, the peso had risen 6.3 percent
this year against the dollar, the best performance among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as the recovery in the
U.S., Mexico&#8217;s largest trading partner, boosted its exports.
Reports showed today that U.S. payrolls surged by the most in
four years in April, while German industrial production rose
more than economists forecast in March. 
&#8220;Mexico is well placed to benefit from the improving
growth outlook in the U.S.,&#8221; Lake said. 
Central banks have more tools to provide &#8220;liquidity&#8221; to
financial institutions than in 2008 and some reports of
&#8220;sovereign contagion risks&#8221; in Europe have been overstated,
Lake said. 
Investors should exit the trade if the peso declines to
13.2 per dollar, according to the note.

&#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; may top $400 million in
domestic ticket sales, kicking off what is likely to be a record
summer for Hollywood studios, analysts said. 
The film, made by Walt Disney Co&#8217;s Marvel Entertainment and
distributed by Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount Pictures, opens in
theaters today and is projected to take in as much as $155
million this weekend in the U.S. and Canada, according to
Jeffrey Hartke, an analyst with Hollywood Stock Exchange.com. 
Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer&#8217;s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com&#8217;s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely going to have a record,&#8221; Dergarabedian
said in an interview. 
As of May 3, year-to-date receipts totaled $3.36 billion in
U.S. and Canadian theaters, up 6.3 percent from $3.25 billion a
year ago, according to Hollywood.com. 
Studios are scheduled to release seven three-dimensional
films this summer, including Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; on June 18
and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc&#8217;s &#8220;Shrek Forever After&#8221; on
May 21. The average ticket price for 3-D and 2-D movies combined
in the U.S. and Canada is about $7.95, up from $7.45 last
summer, according to Hollywood.com. 
&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; which was not filmed in 3-D, features
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who dons an armored, jet-
powered suit. Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson co-star. 
&#8216;Twilight: Eclipse&#8217; 
The original film, released in 2008, generated worldwide
ticket sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; has taken in $132.9 million since its
release last week outside the U.S. The movie may reach $400
million in domestic sales, Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with
Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in a May 3 note. 
Other films likely to generate significant sales this
summer include Summit Entertainment LLC&#8217;s &#8220;The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse,&#8221; the third film in the series based on the novels by
Stephenie Meyer, Dergarabedian said. The first two movies,
starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, have had
worldwide sales of $1.1 billion, according to Box Office Mojo.

General Growth Properties Inc.&#8217;s board
backed the latest financing proposal from a group led by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in court, rejecting Simon
Property Group Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;best and final&#8221; offer. General Growth
fell as much as 13 percent in New York trading. 
The Brookfield-led plan is better than Simon&#8217;s, General
Growth President Thomas Nolan said in testimony read in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today. Lawyers for Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, said the company will withdraw from
bidding if U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper approves the
Brookfield plan, partly because the stock warrants that
accompany it would make Simon&#8217;s buyout more expensive. 
Under the revision introduced today, Brookfield&#8217;s
investment partner Pershing Square Capital Management LP would
forgo any warrants until General Growth&#8217;s reorganization is
complete, and Toronto-based Brookfield would increase the strike
price on its warrants to $10.75 from $10.50, General Growth
lawyer Marcia Goldstein told Gropper. Another partner, Fairholme
Capital Management LLC, also would get warrants. 
The hearing comes a day after Indianapolis-based Simon
stepped up its three-month quest to acquire General Growth by
making a $6.5 billion bid for the Chicago-based company.
Brookfield&#8217;s rival proposal would leave General Growth an
independent company. 
$20 a Share 
Simon&#8217;s offer is valued at $20 a share, the company said
yesterday in a statement. It consists of $5 in cash, $10 in
shares of Simon stock and the distribution of shares in a new
company, General Growth Opportunities, valued at $5. 
General Growth fell $1.24, or 7.8 percent, to $14.60 at
1:59 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares earlier
traded as low as $13.86. 
&#8220;These offers are best and final,&#8221; Simon Chief Executive
Officer David Simon said in a letter to General Growth&#8217;s board.
Simon &#8220;will not participate in the bidding process in the GGP
bankruptcy proceeding in any way once GGP commits to issue the
warrants associated with the latest Brookfield-sponsored plan.&#8221; 
Pershing Square&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer William Ackman
responded today with a letter to the General Growth board
offering to forgo 17 million interim warrants. Ackman made the
offer in an effort to push through Brookfield&#8217;s plan, saying
Simon&#8217;s bid posed antitrust risks because it would link the
nation&#8217;s two largest mall owners. 
Simon estimates the warrants could cost General Growth
shareholders $895 million. Ronen Bojmel, a managing director at
General Growth&#8217;s financial adviser Miller Buckfire  Co.,
testified today that they would be worth about $688 million. 
Unsecured Debt 
Simon&#8217;s original bid on Feb. 16 would have given General
Growth stockholders $9 a share, including $6 in cash. That was
turned down as too low. Both that plan and the new one pay all
General Growth unsecured creditors, who hold about $7 billion in
debt, in full. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

said today in a court hearing. 
General Growth&#8217;s plan to give Brookfield, Fairholme Capital
Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LP
warrants to buy stock in the reorganized company in exchange for
funding has been changed so that Pershing will waive its share
of interim warrants, and Brookfield will increase the strike
price on its warrants to $10.75 from $10.50, Goldstein told U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan today.

The $3.1 billion merger of UAL Corp.&#8217;s
United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. was only the
year&#8217;s 38th-largest deal. That didn&#8217;t keep some of Wall Street&#8217;s
top rainmakers from getting involved. 
James B. Lee Jr., a vice chairman and veteran merger
adviser at JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
Michael Carr, a senior member of the firm&#8217;s merger leadership
group, advised UAL Chief Executive Officer Glenn Tilton. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Robert Kindler, head of global mergers and
acquisitions, worked with Continental, alongside Lazard Ltd.&#8217;s
Harry Pinson, a banker in the carrier&#8217;s home city of Houston. 
The merger, which creates the world&#8217;s biggest airline with
almost 86,000 employees, was the second effort in two years to
bring United and Continental to the altar. In April 2008, the
airlines were hours away from approving a deal when Continental
pulled out of talks and resolved to remain independent. 
&#8220;The deal executed last Sunday night was virtually the same
transaction we negotiated two years ago,&#8221; Lee said in an
interview with Charlie Rose published in Bloomberg
Businessweek&#8217;s May 10 issue. &#8220;The seeds were planted quite some
time ago.&#8221; 
United and Continental announced the merger on May 3 after
signing the deal the night before at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine  Moore LLP, United&#8217;s legal counsel. 
GE, PepsiCo 
JPMorgan&#8217;s team included Thomas Miles, Christopher Ventresca, co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions,
and David Fox, head of Midwest investment banking. Goldman&#8217;s
Patrick McClymont also advised Chicago-based United. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Nelson Walsh and Josh Connor were part of the group
advising Continental. 
The deal is the latest in a series of high-profile mandates
for Lee and Kindler. Lee, 57, a longtime adviser to UAL&#8217;s
Tilton, helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt holders. 
Kindler, 56, advised PepsiCo Inc.&#8217;s biggest bottler on its
sale to the soda and snack maker last year, and helped CF
Industries Holdings Inc. win a year-long battle to buy Terra
Industries Inc. Carr has been helping Airgas Inc. defend against
a hostile takeover bid from Air Products  Chemicals Inc. 
For legal advice, United is using Cravath&#8217;s Scott Barshay
and George Zobitz. Continental&#8217;s CEO Jeff Smisek is using the
law firm where he once worked, Vinson  Elkins, where Kevin Lewis is working on the deal. Jones Day&#8217;s Robert Profusek and
Mark Metts and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP are also
advising. 
There have been 32 airline deals so far this year, with a
total value of $7.7 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The largest was the $3.3 billion takeover of Japan
Airlines Corp. by Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of
Japan, the state-affiliated fund. 
Goldman Sachs is the biggest merger adviser this year,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan is third, and Morgan Stanley and
Lazard are fifth and sixth respectively.

&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; a sequel based on the
Marvel superhero comics, opened as the top movie in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, kicking off the summer film season with
$133.6 million for Walt Disney Co. and distributor Paramount
Pictures. 
The film posted the fifth-highest opening weekend gross
ever, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. 
The movie marks what is likely to be a record summer box-
office season for Hollywood, Hollywood.com said. The original
&#8220;Iron Man,&#8221; released in 2008, generated total worldwide ticket
sales of $585 million, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. 
&#8220;It delivered on what it promised,&#8221; said Jeff Bock,
senior box-office analyst at Los Angeles-based Exhibitor
Relations Co. &#8220;The original film set the bar so high, but this
was on target with all expectations in what it offered.&#8221; 
In the sequel, Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, an
industrialist who dons a jet-powered, armored suit to fight
villains. 
The movie had $10.2 million in sales at Imax Corp.
theaters, a record for the company. 
Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; holds the record for
the highest grossing film with $158.4 million in its opening
weekend in July 2008. It went on to earn $533.3 million at the
domestic box office, Hollywood.com said. 
&#8216;Nightmare on Elm Street&#8217; 
Higher ticket prices and demand for 3-D movies will likely
push box-office sales beyond last summer&#8217;s record $4.25 billion,
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com&#8217;s box-office
tracking unit. Screenings in 3-D have accounted for $851
million, or 25 percent, of all box-office revenue this year,
according to Hollywood.com. Theaters typically charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D movie. 
&#8220;A Nightmare on Elm Street&#8221; dropped to second place with
$9.2 million for Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s New Line studio. The film,
which features Jackie Earle Haley as serial-killer Freddy
Krueger, has taken in $48.5 million in two weeks. 
&#8220;How to Train Your Dragon,&#8221; from DreamWorks Animation SKG
Inc., dropped to third place from second with sales of $6.8
million. The film has made $201 million in six weeks of release. 
&#8220;Date Night,&#8221; a comedy starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell, fell to fourth place from third, taking in $5.3 million
for News Corp. 
&#8216;Robin Hood&#8217; 
&#8220;The Back-Up Plan,&#8221; from CBS Corp.&#8217;s film division,
dropped to fifth place from fourth with sales of $4.3 million.
The romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez, has made $29.4
million in three weeks. 
&#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; will debut next weekend and likely won&#8217;t
take the No. 1 spot from &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; Bock said. 
&#8220;It will be tough to beat &#8216;Iron Man,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only
&#8216;Shrek Forever After&#8217; and &#8216;Toy Story 3&#8217; may have a chance. Those
are probably the top three movies of the summer.&#8221; 
Sales for the top 12 films rose 21.9 percent to $173.9
million from $142.8 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said.
Year-to-date receipts total $3.66 billion, up 6.5 percent from
$3.43 billion. Attendance has fallen 0.08 percent this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, said a new tax on executive bonuses in the
U.K. will be &#8220;material,&#8221; without specifying how much it will
cost the company. 
&#8220;The impact of this legislation is in the process of being
quantified, and is expected to be material,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a
regulatory filing today. 
JPMorgan said the charge will appear in the second quarter,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., ranked
first and third in the U.S. by assets, said in separate filings
last week that they expect to pay $465 million and $400 million,
respectively. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has estimated the tax may
cost more than $600 million. 
U.K. officials, seeking to assuage public outrage over
bailout programs, imposed a one-time tax on bonuses of more than
25,000 pounds, or about $37,000 at current exchange rates. The
levy covers bonuses awarded between Dec. 9, 2009, and April 5.
George Osborne, the U.K. Conservative lawmaker in charge of the
party&#8217;s Treasury policy, said in January large cash bank bonuses
are unacceptable at a time when ordinary workers are struggling
to cope with the recession. 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank, said in a
filing last week that it will recognize a charge without saying
how much. 
The U.K. Treasury, which initially said the tax would raise
550 million pounds, has estimated it may net as much as 2
billion pounds, according to a government official who declined
to be identified. 
JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in U.S. aid last year,
remained profitable throughout the financial crisis, relying on
fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending and credit
cards.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche
Bank AG are in talks to provide about $2 billion of financing to
a group led by Centerbridge Partners LP and Paulson  Co. that
is bidding for bankrupt U.S. hotel chain Extended Stay Inc., two
people familiar with the situation said. 
The Centerbridge-Paulson led group, which also includes
Blackstone Group LP, has committed to invest up to $905.4
million into Extended Stay, trumping an early offer from a group
lead by Starwood Capital. A deal with the banks, which would be
backed by Extended Stay&#8217;s real estate, hasn&#8217;t been completed,
said the people, who declined to be named because the
negotiations are private. 
Extended Stay, which filed the largest bankruptcy case by a
U.S. hotel owner in June, withdrew its request for approval of
the Starwood proposal last month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are in talks to provide the Starwood-led group
with about $2.2 billion of financing, a person familiar with the
situation said. 
At an April 8 hearing, Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for
Extended Stay at Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP in New York, said
the company favored the Centerbridge-Paulson offer over
Starwood&#8217;s. Under the terms, the hotelier can seek better deals,
and an auction is planned for May 27, she said. 
Bundling Debt 
The banks plan on bundling the debt to be sold as bonds,
said the people. Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities
plummeted to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $232.4 billion
in 2007 as credit markets seized up, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Even with U.S. government aid, only $3.04 billion
of the bonds were sold last year, and a $309.7 million issue was
the only offering this year. 
David Lichtenstein&#8217;s Lightstone Group LLC bought Extended
Stay in 2007, relying on more than $7 billion in debt financing
to complete the $8 billion deal just weeks before the leveraged-
buyout market imploded. 
Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup
declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Starwood.
Representatives of Centerbridge, Paulson and Goldman Sachs
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The Centerbridge-Paulson offer includes $450 million in
cash, $200 million to backstop a rights offering and as much as
$255.4 million to creditors who elect to take cash at a 30
percent discount to the value of the stock the reorganization
plan otherwise would give them. 
May 17 Deadline 
The $450 million equity injection is for 43 percent of the
new company and the backstop represents another 19 percent. 
The deadline for proposals for investing in Extended Stay
is May 17. Starwood plans to bid for the hotel chain, Bruce Zirinsky, a lawyer for Starwood at Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York, said at an April 22 court hearing. 
Five Mile Capital Partners LLC, an alternative-investment
firm in Stamford, Connecticut, and TPG, a private-equity firm in
Fort Worth, Texas, are part of Starwood&#8217;s investment group. The
talks with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were previously reported
by the Wall Street Journal. 
The case is In re Extended Stay Inc. 09-13764, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s traders
made money every single day of the first quarter, a feat the
firm has never accomplished before. 
Daily trading net revenue was $25 million or higher in all
of the first quarter&#8217;s 63 trading days, New York-based Goldman
Sachs reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. The firm reaped more than $100 million on 35
of the days, or more than half the time. 
Goldman Sachs, which is facing a fraud lawsuit from the SEC
related to the sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
generated $9.74 billion in trading revenue in the first quarter,
exceeding all of its Wall Street competitors. Trading accounted
for 76 percent of first-quarter revenue. The lack of trading
losses could add to the perception that Goldman Sachs has an
unfair advantage in the markets, said one shareholder. 
&#8220;It will reinforce the heads we win, tails you lose
mentality that people think actually exists and promotes the
concept of an unfair advantage,&#8221; said Douglas Ciocca, a
managing director at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood,
Kansas, which oversees about $2 billion in assets including
Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s too politically charged not to, how
is that possible that they only make money?&#8221; 
Record Earnings 
The bank, which reported record earnings last year, is
contesting the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit and the firm&#8217;s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing last month.
Goldman Sachs, which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is
also being investigated by federal prosecutors, said people
familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;This is the first time we have reported zero trading loss
days in a quarter,&#8221; Samuel Robinson, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
said in an e-mail. &#8220;We believe it shows the strength of our
customer franchise and risk management.&#8221; 
Ciocca echoed that view, saying he thinks the performance
proves the strength of the firm&#8217;s risk-management models and its
ability to make money even in markets with low volatility. 
&#8220;The statistical probability of going through what we did
would never favor them making money every day,&#8221; Ciocca said.
&#8220;It actually speaks very well of their capability to manage
through different types of markets.&#8221; 
Reaching Out 
Ciocca said he&#8217;s had first-hand experience of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s efforts to reach out to clients in the wake of the SEC
lawsuit to answer questions about the matter. He said
representatives from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset-management division
contacted his firm during the last week of April even though
they hadn&#8217;t been in touch for a year before that. 
&#8220;It was tactical, it was appropriate, it wasn&#8217;t
patronizing, it was very sincere,&#8221; Ciocca said. 
In its SEC filing today, Goldman Sachs said it is expecting
further litigation related to sales of collateralized debt
obligations. 
&#8220;We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs,&#8221; the bank said. 
The company also laid out in the filing a worst-case
scenario of what could happen if the firm doesn&#8217;t resolve the
SEC case and can&#8217;t obtain appropriate waivers from relevant
regulators. 
Imposing Restrictions 
The results could include &#8220;an inability to act as a
registered broker-dealer or provide certain advisory and other
services to U.S. registered mutual funds,&#8221; the filing said.
&#8220;In addition, regulators could impose restrictions on the
activities of our banking, commodities, investment advisory or
other regulated businesses.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter earnings were the second-
highest in the company&#8217;s history. 
The firm&#8217;s stock dropped 22 percent from before the SEC
lawsuit was filed on April 16 through May 7, making it the worst
performer among the six largest U.S. banks so far in 2010. 
The shares rose 84 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $143.83 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, as global
stocks soared with the European loan program to end the
sovereign-debt crisis.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit filed by Jefferson County, Alabama, that
claims the bank enticed it into a risky refinancing of about $3
billion of sewer debt by making $8 million in payments to
friends of county officials. 
Circuit Judge Caryl Penney Privett in Birmingham rejected
the New York-based bank&#8217;s arguments that the county is barred by
the statue of limitations, a time limit for bringing action, and
its contention that the county failed to show that JPMorgan was
involved in a conspiracy, in a ruling issued May 7. 
Jefferson County, in the suit filed in November, alleged
fraud, conspiracy and &#8220;unjust enrichment against those who have
brought the county and its citizens to the brink of financial
disaster while lining their own pockets.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, advised
the state&#8217;s most populous county in 2002 and 2003 to enter into
a series of floating-rate bond and interest-rate swaps that
created an &#8220;inherently flawed financial structure that imploded
within just a few years,&#8221; according to the county&#8217;s complaint. 
Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
today. 
Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, also named in the
suit, were the managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan who
oversaw the sewer-debt transactions. LeCroy and MacFaddin are
accused of arranging $8.2 million in illegal payments to local
broker-dealers who were friends of county commissioners, in
exchange for the county&#8217;s business. 
Larry Langford, former mayor of Birmingham and president of
the county commission at the time of the debt refinancing, is
serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison in Kentucky for
accepting $241,000 in bribes from William Blount, of Montgomery
investment firm Blount Parrish  Co. Blount was paid $2.8
million by JPMorgan during the bond transactions. 
Bankruptcy Brink 
Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, has teetered on the
brink of bankruptcy after interest rates on $3.2 billion in
bonds soared in 2008, when companies that insured them lost
their credit ratings because of losses on unrelated mortgage-
backed securities. 
In November, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into derivative sales to the county. 
The bank paid $50 million outright to the county, and
agreed to cancel $647 million in fees the county faced to unwind
the transactions. JPMorgan, which also paid $25 million to be
placed in a fund to compensate affected investors, neither
admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

The zloty may gain 12 percent against
the dollar after European leaders unveiled a loan package to
contain Greece&#8217;s debt crisis, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., which advised investors to buy Poland&#8217;s currency. 
The zloty may appreciate to 2.8 per dollar compared with
3.1250 on 5:20 p.m. in Warsaw, the New York-based bank wrote in
a research note today. The euro may depreciate against the zloty
&#8220;back towards its April lows&#8221; as the aid package creates &#8220;a
solid backdrop for further recovery in risk sentiment,&#8221; it
wrote.

Japan, Australia, Brazil, China, China Economy, Country Economies, Currencies, Emerging Markets, India, Korea, Markets, Pacific Rim, Russia, Specialized Regions, Taiwan" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-10/morgan-stanley-says-china-pboc-has-changed-yuan-language-in-latest-report.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Says China PBOC Has Changed Yuan Language in Latest Report</headline><body>
Morgan Stanley said that China&#8217;s
central bank changed language relating to yuan policy in its
latest monetary policy report, signaling its intention to let
the yuan appreciate. 
Policy makers plan to further improve the managed float
exchange-rate regime and keep the currency broadly stable
&#8220;based on market demand and supply, and with reference to a
currency basket,&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China said in the
outlook section of a quarterly statement today. The previous
report called for improving policies in a &#8220;controllable&#8221; and
&#8220;gradual&#8221; manner. 
&#8220;The change is big, it&#8217;s huge,&#8221; said Wang Qing, chief
economist for Greater China in Hong Kong at Morgan Stanley.
&#8220;They haven&#8217;t used this language of saying the currency should
be determined on a currency basket, and determined by market
demand and supply and a managed-float exchange regime. This
language has been missing for many reports.&#8221; 
China halted the currency&#8217;s 21 percent, three-year advance
against the dollar in July 2008 to help exporters weather
recessions in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Officially its
exchange-rate regime still involves managing the exchange rate
against a basket of currencies including the euro and the
Japanese yen. 
Export Gain 
Before the statement, yuan forwards strengthened the most
this year after China reported a pickup in exports, fanning
optimism policy makers will let the currency appreciate.
Exports rose 30.5 percent in April from a year earlier, the
customs bureau said today, exceeding the previous month&#8217;s 24.3
percent gain and the 28.9 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. 
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.5 percent
to 6.6778 per dollar as of 5:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 2.2 percent from the spot
rate of 6.8265, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s
the biggest increase since Dec. 22. 
The yuan&#8217;s 12-month forwards also climbed after European
Union finance ministers announced an aid package worth as much
as 750 billion euros ($962 billion). Interest-rate swaps
increased before inflation data is released tomorrow. 
China had a trade surplus of $1.68 billion last month, the
customs bureau said, compared with a deficit of $7.24 billion
in March. Economists forecast a shortfall of $550 million,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. 
Banks have interpreted shifts in language before only to
be proved wrong. The central bank scrapped the pledge to keep
the yuan &#8220;basically stable&#8221; in its quarterly monetary policy
report on Nov. 11. Subsequent reports included the language
again.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, is expecting further litigation related to sales of
collateralized debt obligations. 
&#8220;We anticipate that additional putative shareholder
derivative actions and other litigation may be filed, and
regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced
against us with respect to offering of CDOs,&#8221; the New York-
based company said in a quarterly filing with the SEC today. 
The bank, which reported record earnings last year, was hit
by a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission last month and the bank&#8217;s executives were
interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing. Goldman Sachs,
which maintains that it did nothing wrong, is also being
investigated by federal prosecutors, said people familiar with
the matter. 
The company received letters from shareholders &#8220;demanding
the board take action to address alleged misconduct&#8221; by Goldman
Sachs and certain officers and employees, it said in the filing.
The demands are in connection with the 2007 CDO transaction at
the heart of the SEC case, Goldman said. 
Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from trading than any
other Wall Street firm, also disclosed that its traders
generated $100 million or more on 35 days during the first
quarter and lost money on no days. The firm set a record when it
made $100 million or more on 46 days in the second quarter.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may say first-quarter profit surged on
lower writedowns and higher life premiums. 
Net income will probably increase to 477 million euros
($622 million) from 104 million euros a year earlier, according
to the median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 412 million euros to 555 million euros. 
&#8220;Life insurance continues to benefit from a supportive
environment for traditional business,&#8221; Niccolo Dalla Palma, an
analyst at Exane BNP Paribas with a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation
on the stock, wrote in a May 6 report. &#8220;All of the growth
in group premiums is likely to be driven by this line
of business.&#8221; 
Cesare Geronzi, appointed Generali&#8217;s new chairman last
month, wants to boost growth outside Italy. The insurer is
already expanding in emerging markets, including China and the
Middle East, and in eastern Europe as it seeks to recover from
the global financial crisis. 
Analysts including Ralph Hebgen at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Ltd. expect non-life business to be affected by claims related
to winter storm Xinthia, which Generali estimated to fall within
a range of 60 million euros to 80 million euros. Life premiums
are expected to rise 19 percent to more than 14 billion euros. 
The insurer is due to report earnings on May 12 at about
1 p.m. local time and to hold a conference call at 2:30 p.m.
the same day. Following is a table of the analysts&#8217; estimates
and the year-earlier results. The figures are in millions of
euros, except the combined ratio.

Copper is looking &#8220;attractive&#8221;
after the recent selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;Copper fundamentals, which have begun to tighten, will
likely continue to do so as developed markets demand continues
to improve against slowing but still robust emerging markets
demand,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed report. 
Copper will be the first of the metals to hit supply
constraints on a sustained basis, the bank&#8217;s analysts including
Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. 
The metal had its worst week in three months last week on
concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may derail the global economic
recovery. Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.2 percent to $7,100.75 a metric ton
today, after tumbling 6.5 percent last week. 
Copper prices more than doubled last year as government
stimulus packages, including China&#8217;s $586 billion program, drove
demand. Copper has fallen 4.1 percent this year on concern that
China&#8217;s measures to rein in lending and curb property
speculation will curb demand for the metal used in construction
and automobiles. 
The fundamentals for zinc are expected to &#8220;tighten
meaningfully&#8221; in the next 12 to 24 months, &#8220;hastened by mine
retirements,&#8221; the analysts wrote. 
&#8220;These fundamental views suggest that price risk is skewed
to the upside for copper in the near-to-medium term and for zinc
in the medium-to-longer term, especially given the magnitude of
the recent pullback,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Consumers should view price
dips in these metals as buying opportunities, with recent price
action providing a compelling opportunity for copper in
particular.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying a basket of Asian currencies against the yen, saying
there is &#8220;little obvious contagion&#8221; risk from Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis. 
The bank especially recommended the Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah because of &#8220;strong growth,
solid external balances and declining risk aversion,&#8221; according
to a research note today written by analysts including Fiona
Lake and Mark Tan. All 10 Asian emerging-market currencies
gained today versus the yen after the European Union unveiled an
unprecedented loan package to stop Greece&#8217;s fiscal woes from
spreading. 
&#8220;Given that European policy makers have now announced a
credible package to shore up the system in euroland, we expect
the market to turn its attention to trading the macro data,&#8221;
the report said. &#8220;The macro backdrop in Malaysia, Philippines
and Indonesia remains strong.&#8221; 
The ringgit led gains in Asian currencies versus the yen
this year, climbing 7.1 percent, followed by the rupiah with a
3.6 percent advance. The peso has climbed 2.2 percent against
the yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Goldman Sachs targets a basket of currencies including the
ringgit, peso and the rupiah to rise 6 percent against the yen,
without specifying a time frame. It recommended limiting losses
on the trade after a 2 percent decline. 
Regional Growth 
Indonesia&#8217;s economy grew at the fastest pace in more than a
year last quarter, expanding 5.7 percent from a year earlier,
the Central Statistics Office said today. Malaysia&#8217;s gross
domestic product probably expanded 9.3 percent in the first
three months from a year earlier, after growing 4.5 percent the
previous quarter, a government report on May 13 may show,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. 
The yen fell against all 10 Asian major currencies today as
demand for high-yielding assets surged after the Bank of Japan
said central banks from the U.S., Japan and Europe will
participate in temporary U.S. dollar swap agreements to contain
the debt crisis. European Union finance ministers announced an
aid package worth as much as 750 billion euros ($962 billion),
according to Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado. 
The yen is a favorite currency for funding carry trades, in
which money borrowed in a nation with low interest rates is
invested in a country offering higher returns. The risk is that
currency moves erase those gains.

Four of the largest U.S. banks,
including Citigroup Inc., racked up perfect quarters in their
trading businesses between January and March, underscoring how
government support and less competition is fueling Wall Street&#8217;s
revival. 
Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the first, second and fifth-biggest U.S. banks
by assets, all said in regulatory filings that they had zero
days of trading losses in the first quarter. Citigroup Inc., the
third-largest, doesn&#8217;t break out its daily trading revenue by
quarter. It recorded a profit on each trading day, two people
with knowledge of the results said. 
&#8220;The trading profits of the Street is just another way of
measuring the subsidy the Fed is giving to the banks,&#8221; said
Christopher Whalen, managing director of Torrance, California-
based Institutional Risk Analytics. &#8220;It&#8217;s a transfer from
savers to banks.&#8221; 
The trading results, which helped the banks report higher
quarterly profit than analysts estimated even as unemployment
stagnated at a 27-year high, came with a big assist from the
Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank helped lenders by holding
short-term borrowing costs near zero, giving them a chance to
profit by carrying even 10-year government notes that yielded an
average of 3.70 percent last quarter.

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest
media company, said fiscal second-quarter profit climbed 55
percent on a rebound at the film studio. The shares fell after
the television units&#8217; profit missed some analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Programming costs rose at ESPN, which had a &#8220;mid-single-
digits&#8221; percentage increase in advertising sales, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today. The ABC broadcast network
was hampered by lower prime-time ratings and higher expenses. 
&#8220;The cable network margins were a little bit light of what
people were expecting,&#8221; said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen 
Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;Disney had talked about how they were
going to have sports programming-rights expenses, but I think
the magnitude of that caught some people by surprise.&#8221; 
Disney fell $1.20, or 3.4 percent, to $34.56 in extended
trading after the results were announced. The shares gained 47
cents to $35.76 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and have increased 11 percent this year. 
Net income rose to $953 million, or 48 cents a share, from
$613 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, Disney said in a
statement. That beat the 46-cent average of 22 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period ended April
3 gained 6.1 percent to $8.58 billion after the January takeover
of Marvel Entertainment. Analysts expected $8.42 billion. 
Bookings Drop 
Hotel reservations at the theme parks are pacing down 10
percent in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call after the results. The company
is using fewer discounts to lure visitors to parks near Orlando,
Florida, and in Anaheim, California. 
&#8220;To the extent that they had a beat in the quarter it was
driven by film. I think people would rather have seen it
driven by cable and parks,&#8221; Creutz, who rates the shares
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; said in an interview. 
Profit in the cable division led by ESPN totaled $1.18
billion, short of the $1.21 billion estimate of Imran Khan, an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. who has a neutral rating on the
stock. Revenue in the division, including the Disney Channel,
gained 9.4 percent to $2.41 billion, led by increases in
affiliate fees, the company said. 
Ad Revenue 
ESPN&#8217;s ad revenue was up by a &#8220;mid-single-digits&#8221;
percentage in the quarter, Rasulo said. 
Discovery Communications Inc., the owner of Animal Planet,
reported a 9 percent gain in U.S. cable ad revenue last week.
Time Warner Inc., the owner of CNN and TBS, said cable ad sales
gained 9 percent. 
&#8220;Sometimes some of the numbers we see out there are not
apples-to-apples across different companies,&#8221; Rasulo said. He
said Disney reports ad revenue that includes cash sales and
make-goods. 
Profit in Disney&#8217;s broadcast division, including ABC, fell
24 percent to $123 million, while revenue gained 1.1 percent to
$1.43 billion. Khan had expected profit of $170.1 million. 
In the current quarter, prices for commercials on ABC sold
close to air date are up 30 percent from spots sold last year in
advance of the current TV season, Disney said. Ad sales at ESPN
and the TV stations are pacing up by &#8220;double digits&#8221; compared
with a year ago, Rasulo said. 
ESPN Ad Sales 
Worldwide ticket sales of $960.4 million for the 3-D
&#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; revived Disney&#8217;s film profit. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger named Rich Ross, former head of
the Disney Channel, to lead the studio in October and completed
the $4.2 billion purchase of Marvel, maker of &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; in
January. 
Led by &#8220;Alice,&#8221; which was shown in three-dimensional and
standard format, the studio reported a profit of $223 million,
compared with $13 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 7
percent to $1.54 billion from $1.44 billion a year earlier, when
Disney&#8217;s films included &#8220;Race to Witch Mountain&#8221; and
&#8220;Confessions of a Shopaholic.&#8221; 
&#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; distributed by Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount, has
collected $323.4 million in global ticket sales as of May 9,
according to Box Office Mojo, a unit of Seattle-based Amazon.com
Inc. &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; from Disney&#8217;s Pixar studio, will be in
theaters on June 18. 
Profit from theme parks fell 12 percent to $150 million,
while revenue gained 1.7 percent to $2.45 billion as higher
guest spending countered a drop in attendance. Pension and
retiree medical costs rose.

Electrical Components International
Inc., a maker of wire harnesses for appliances, won court
approval of its restructuring plan, paving the way for the
company to exit bankruptcy after less than two months. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey gave Electrical
Components approval of its pre-packaged reorganization plan,
which swaps debt for new equity, at a hearing today in
Wilmington, Delaware. 
The plan will reduce the company&#8217;s debt by about half,
according to court documents. Electrical Components expects to
leave bankruptcy protection within a few days, said Stephen A. Youngman, a lawyer for the company. 
Under the plan, lenders with the highest level of
repayment, owed a principal amount of about $261.4 million, will
get 54.7 percent of the new common stock and a $145 million term
loan, court papers show. Some of the lenders elected to receive
$10.4 million in cash rather than stock. 
Investors, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp. and
Sankaty Advisors, will buy the remaining 45.3 percent of the new
stock for about $32.9 million, according to court papers. 
Lenders with a secondary priority of repayment, owed a
principal of about $60 million, will share $10 million, court
papers show. Unsecured creditors won&#8217;t be affected by the
restructuring. 
Francisco Partners 
The St. Louis-based company listed assets of about $363.6
million and debt of about $435.7 million in Chapter 11 documents
filed March 30. The company is owned by San Francisco-based
private-equity firm Francisco Partners LP. 
Electrical Components makes wire harnesses, bundles of
wires or cables fitted with connectors or plugs that deliver
electricity throughout appliances, according to court documents. 
The company said it is the largest supplier of wire
harnesses to the North American white-goods market, a term used
for large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.
The company&#8217;s products also are used in automobiles and
construction and agriculture equipment, according to its Web
site. 
Electrical Components generated about $460 million in sales
for the year ended Dec. 31, court papers show. The company
supplies companies such as General Motors Co., Chrysler Group
LLC, General Electric Co., and the world&#8217;s largest appliance
maker, Whirlpool Corp. 
The case is In re Electrical Components International Inc.,
10-11054, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).

Financial markets are likely to
remain volatile as investors weigh the consequences of Europe&#8217;s
rescue package, said Gary Cohn, president and chief operating
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;We will continue to have relatively volatile markets
until we get a better understanding,&#8221; Cohn said today at a
conference in New York hosted by UBS AG. &#8220;To the extent that
the understanding is that it is a socialization of the risk into
many of the other European economies, we may have continued
negative fallout from that because there is an overall view that
some of those other European economies are not strong enough
themselves to be part of a global bailout.&#8221; 
European policy makers yesterday unveiled a loan package
worth almost $1 trillion and a program of bond purchases in an
effort to stop a sovereign-debt crisis that could jeopardize the
euro. The euro and stocks surged around the world yesterday,
then reversed course earlier today. New York-based Goldman Sachs
generates more revenue from sales and trading than any Wall
Street bank. 
&#8220;I think 24 hours after the realization that there&#8217;s a
solution in Europe, people are more reflective right now on what
does that solution mean longer term?&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;Are we
socializing the risk throughout Europe? What does it mean to
other weaker European countries?&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s infrequent
sales and trading losses are evidence that the division doesn&#8217;t
depend on proprietary trading to generate revenue, President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said. 
&#8220;There is often speculation that proprietary trading
revenues drive our outperformance in these businesses,&#8221; Cohn
said today at a financial services conference hosted by UBS AG
in New York. &#8220;Over the last 12 months we have only recorded 11
loss days. It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which makes more money from sales and
trading than any Wall Street firm, reported yesterday that it
made at least $25 million trading every single day of the first
quarter, the first perfect quarter in the company&#8217;s history. The
company&#8217;s fixed-income, currencies and commodities business,
known as FICC, and equities unit generate those returns by
making markets for clients rather than betting the firm&#8217;s own
money, Cohn said. 
&#8220;The simple answer is that our FICC and equities
businesses are largely global market-making businesses where we
intermediate flows and commit capital and liquidity and in the
process generate revenue including bid-offer spreads,&#8221; Cohn
said. &#8220;These franchises create numerous opportunities for the
firm.&#8221;

&#8220;The higher beta names are down a little bit today after

Patriot Coal Corp., the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal

$34.71. 
Beta is a measurement of volatility. High-beta stocks are
more volatile. Coal is a measure of the economy as it is used to
generate electricity and to make steel. Metallurgical forms of
the fuel are needed by steelmakers.

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc are considering a sale of natural-gas storage capacity
in Germany as they focus on exploration, according to three
people familiar with the matter. 
The companies may begin the process next month after
deciding what assets to sell from their BEB Erdgas und Erdoel
GmbH unit, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the plans are private. The price would depend on what
parts are sold. 
Shell and Exxon hold equal stakes in the Hanover, Germany-
based gas-storage operator, which has about 2 billion cubic
meters of working storage spread over three facilities in the
north of the country, according to its Web site. 
Energy companies are selling filling stations, pipelines
and refineries as they boost spending on oil and gas production
to take advantage of rising prices. Shell is divesting two
German refineries to curb costs and spending, while Exxon sold a
stake in a Norwegian pipe network in April as it reviews assets. 
The BEB storage assets may attract energy suppliers seeking
to stockpile gas to lessen the impact of price fluctuations. Gas
futures in the U.K., Europe&#8217;s largest market for the fuel,
slumped 43 percent in 2009 and are up 15 percent this year. 
Gas-Price Volatility 
&#8220;The attraction of this kind of asset has risen because of
volatility on the gas market,&#8221; said Christian Kleindienst, an
analyst at UniCredit SpA&#8217;s Munich unit with a &#8220;market weight&#8221;
rating on Shell bonds and no coverage of Exxon notes. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want to be just a middleman -- utilities will be looking
to bolster their margins by securing gas they can use to counter
price fluctuations.&#8221; 
David Williams, a spokesman for Shell, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News today. Gabriele Radke, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil Central Europe Holding GmbH, didn&#8217;t
immediately answer an e-mail seeking comment and a call to her
office went unanswered. 
Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, sold its 9.43 percent
stake in Norwegian gas-pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas
Infrastructure AS last month. 
Shell said May 6 that it&#8217;s in talks with potential buyers
for some of its liquefied petroleum gas assets. The company is
also in discussions with India&#8217;s Essar Oil Ltd. and other
interested parties on the sale of three refineries in Germany
and the U.K. 
Exxon and Shell sold about 3,100 kilometers (1,925 miles)
of gas pipelines in Germany to Dutch grid operator Nederlandse
Gasunie NV in 2007. 
Most of Germany&#8217;s gas storage is located in the north of
the country, where rock formations are suited to holding the
fuel. BEB also sells crude oil and sulfur, according to its Web
site.

China, the world&#8217;s second-biggest
electricity consumer, increased power output by the most in
three months in April because of rising demand from industrial
users including carmakers and steel factories. 
Electricity output climbed 21 percent to 331.6 billion
kilowatt-hours last month, according to data from the Beijing-
based National Bureau of Statistics. Crude-oil output gained 4.2
percent to 16.3 million metric tons. The bureau didn&#8217;t provide
coal production data today. 
Industrial production rose 18 percent in April from a year
earlier, increasing electricity needs from factories in the
world&#8217;s biggest exporter of goods. Baoshan Iron  Steel Co.,
China&#8217;s largest publicly traded steelmaker, is running plants at
full capacity as carmakers including General Motors Co. said
they can&#8217;t build enough vehicles to meet demand. 
&#8220;Demand from industries will keep getting stronger,&#8221; Yi Qiao, a power analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone
from Shanghai. 
Property prices rose by a record 12.8 percent in April from
a year earlier, boosting electricity use by builders and makers
of construction materials. 
&#8220;Power output gained last month as the recovery in high-
energy consuming industries accelerated, Sheng Laiyun, spokesman
for the statistics bureau, said today. 
China, the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy, expanded by 11.9
percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in almost three
years. The economy will grow four times faster than the U.S.
this year, the United Nations said in December. 
Energy-Saving Target 
China is facing pressure to meet its energy-saving targets
as the economy expands, Sheng said today. 
The country&#8217;s energy consumption per unit of gross domestic
product rose 3.2 percent in the first quarter, adding to
pressure to cut power intensity for the rest of the year,
Premier Wen Jiabao said in a statement on May 6. 
The first-quarter increase was caused by &#8220;rapid growth&#8221;
in industries including power generation, steel, non-ferrous
metals, construction materials, petroleum and chemicals, Wen
said. 
China&#8217;s electricity use increased 6 percent last year,
according to official data. The country&#8217;s biggest electricity
generators include Huaneng Power International Inc. and Datang
International Power Generation Co.

Jeremy Gerard</headline><body>
British critics have been set
atwitter that the abundantly laureled stage satire &#8220;Enron&#8221;
expired on Broadway Sunday night after barely three weeks,
losing its entire $3.6 million capitalization. 
In London, the show has been a runaway hit since opening
last January in the West End after a sold-out run at the Royal
Court. Here in New York, &#8220;Enron&#8221; didn&#8217;t receive a single major
Tony nomination other than best score -- and it&#8217;s not even a
musical! 
&#8220;Since 9/11 the insular Americans have become terribly
sensitive to criticism,&#8221; Jerry de Groot wrote in the Telegraph.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t mind when Jon Stewart dumps bucketloads of heavy-
handed political satire on the &#8216;Daily Show,&#8217; but they get tetchy
when the criticism is delivered with an English accent.&#8221; 
Michael Billington, the critic of the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian,
suggested Americans were just too stupid to appreciate a satire
requiring a sense of history and a modest understanding of
accounting legerdemain. 
&#8220;If &#8216;Enron&#8217;s&#8217; melancholy saga proves anything,&#8221;
Billington wrote, &#8220;it is Broadway&#8217;s irrelevance to serious
theatre.&#8221; 
He added this: &#8220;At heart, Broadway is a big, gaudy
commercial shop-window, where fortunes are won and lost.&#8221; Stop
the presses! 
Comic Strip 
Still, the abrupt closing shocked me, too. &#8220;Enron&#8221; isn&#8217;t
a great play. But a big, gaudy commercial entertainment? It&#8217;s
that in spades. 
Rupert Goold&#8217;s production of Lucy Prebble&#8217;s broad-stroke
comic strip was as gimcrack as any American idiot could want. It
had four whimsical LED-eyed Velocirapting humanoids devouring
debt. And hot office sex, starring doughy nerd turned master of
his universe Jeffrey Skilling and his in-house competitor
Claudia Roe, while the flashing stock price raced around them. 
Not since Faye Dunaway moaned ratings numbers during a sex
scene in &#8220;Network&#8221; have lust and power been so entertainingly
entangled. 
I called the show&#8217;s lead producer, Jeffrey Richards, whom
I&#8217;ve known since his first Broadway flop, &#8220;Rex,&#8221; in 1976. For
someone lighter by almost $4 million, he was pretty chipper. 
&#8216;Race&#8217; Survived 
&#8220;Look, I believe the straight play can be viable on
Broadway,&#8221; Richards, 61, said. He&#8217;s had a number of hits
recently, including David Mamet&#8217;s &#8220;Race,&#8221; which, unlike
&#8220;Enron,&#8221; survived mostly tepid reviews this season, recovering
its investment. 
When I asked what went wrong with &#8220;Enron,&#8221; Richards
blamed Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;We opened with a sizable advance, but we ate into it
during previews,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then the Goldman Sachs hearings
began. Suddenly we were competing with reality.&#8221; 
This is something of a stretch, though fatigue with
business malfeasance may indeed be one reason the show didn&#8217;t
catch on. 
Richards also said that the play lacked a &#8220;wow factor.&#8221;
People weren&#8217;t leaving the Broadhurst Theatre bristling with the
need to tell anyone who would listen, &#8220;You must see this
show.&#8221; 
I have a different theory, one more typically applied to
musicals: Don&#8217;t confuse your audience. Tell them what to expect
and then give it to them. They&#8217;ll leave happy. 
This is famously what happened when Stephen Sondheim added
&#8220;Comedy Tonight&#8221; to the beginning of &#8220;A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum.&#8221; It let even the dumbest folks in on
the joke, telling them that they were supposed to laugh. 
&#8216;Addams Family&#8217; 
It&#8217;s also what happened more recently, when composer-
lyricist Andrew Lippa rewrote the opening of &#8220;The Addams
Family,&#8221; turning a show critics hated into one that audiences
can&#8217;t get enough of (and the critics still hated). 
&#8220;Who do you think is gonna win in the end, the greedy or
the inept?&#8221; Norbert Leo Butz&#8217;s Skilling asked, after a
delicious screed about the inevitable showdown between
capitalists and bureaucrats. &#8220;We&#8217;re not perfect, but wait til
you see the other guys.&#8221; 
That prompted a collective gasp -- and nervous titters --
the night I saw the show. No one needed to tell these
theatergoers about the parallels between Enron 2001 and Goldman
Sachs 2010. Such bitter pith merely studded the cartoony script. 
Fatal Mistake 
Richards and his marketing team made a fatal mistake in
selling &#8220;Enron&#8221; as the story of Enron. I&#8217;d have put Skilling
in Devil&#8217;s p.j.s, with the Enron &#8220;E&#8221; as his pitchfork. Bring
in a carny barker hawking its Side Show wares. See the Scaly
Raptors! The Two-Faced Man! The Disappearing Cash! 
Then, perhaps, the New York Times&#8217;s Ben Brantley might have
approached the show in a lighter mood, instead of treating it
like a kvetch, an annoying pain he had to endure. He called it
&#8220;a flashy but labored economics lesson...&#8221; Well, maybe for
him. But anyway, that rang the death knell. 
Ever the diplomat, Richards was having none of it. 
&#8220;It is not fair to blame the New York Times for the
failure of the show. There are plays that make it without the
Times.&#8221; 
Not this one. &#8220;Enron&#8221; promised a memory we&#8217;d rather
forget, instead of a thrill ride most of us could really use
just now.

Microsoft Corp. expects customers to
adopt the new version of Office at the fastest pace in the
software&#8217;s 20-year history, helping reverse a sales slump and
fend off competition from Google Inc.&#8217;s Web-based programs. 
The software has been tested by 8.6 million users,
Microsoft said, more than three times as many as any previous
version, signaling that adoption will be quick. Users also are
likely to upgrade to the new package of business software at the
same time they install Windows 7, released last year, said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president in the Office group. 
&#8220;This version will be the best ever in terms of adoption
speed, both because of the interest we are seeing and the
Windows 7 adoption curve,&#8221; Capossela said in an interview last
week. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, held an event in New York today to mark the
official release of Office 2010 to businesses. 
Microsoft&#8217;s $19 billion business division, which gets most
of its revenue from Office, could use the boost. Its sales will
drop 3 percent in the fiscal year ending in June, UBS AG analyst
Brent Thill estimated. While the new software will spur orders
in the coming year, the comeback will hinge on whether
businesses recommit to technology spending -- something they&#8217;ve
been slow to do in the wake of the recession. 
&#8216;Precarious Recovery&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still a precarious recovery,&#8221; said Sarah Friar, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in San Francisco, who
recommends buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the camp of
expecting a more moderate migration. It&#8217;s kind of, &#8216;steady as
she goes.&#8217; It&#8217;s not a raging rush to upgrade.&#8221; 
Microsoft said last month that a recovery in corporate
spending on personal computers and software was just beginning.
Multiyear contracts, which account for 60 percent of the Office
unit&#8217;s sales, are still taking longer to close because
businesses are keeping a lid on expenses. 
Home-computer shoppers have fueled the PC industry&#8217;s
rebound so far, snapping up laptops and netbooks. 
&#8220;I wish I could predict what business PC adoption is going
to be,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s Capossela said. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to see
consumers buying PCs in such numbers. That sets us up for a
great consumer uptake. The business uptake will also be
excellent, but businesses are certainly slower to start spending
money again.&#8221; 
Microsoft rose 56 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $29.44 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
declined 3.4 percent this year. 
Aging Software 
More than half of Office customers now use a version of the
program that&#8217;s at least seven years old, giving Microsoft an
opportunity to get them to upgrade, Thill said. For the year
starting July 1, the new Office will spur an increase of 12
percent in sales for the business division, he predicts. 
General Electric Co. plans to switch about half of its
desktop computers, or about 175,000 machines, to Office 2010
this year, Capossela said today. Royal KPN NV and its subsidiary
Getronics NV already have put the program on some machines and
will roll it out to more than 45,000 this year. 
For the first time, Office will include Web-based versions
of popular programs like Word and Excel. The company already has
40 million users of Internet-delivered versions of its Exchange
e-mail server and SharePoint server programs, which let
customers&#8217; employees create internal company websites and
collaborate on projects.

Office 2010 also adds the ability to edit photos and videos
in PowerPoint presentations, and co-authoring features let
different people work on one file at the same time. Users can
select an option to save documents on the Internet, so they can
be retrieved when employees are away from the office. 
Customers also can broadcast PowerPoint slide shows over
the Internet to any user with a Web browser. The Outlook Social
Connector turns the e-mail program into a central repository for
data from sites like Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn. 
Adding Internet features gives Microsoft fresh ammunition
against Google, which has targeted Office customers with its
Internet-based Google Apps. 
Businesses that already have Office 2007 should just update
it with Google Apps to add Internet and collaboration features,
Google says. Many workers don&#8217;t need a new version of Office, or
any version at all, said Chris Vander Mey, a product manager at
Mountain View, California-based Google. 
&#8220;Office is a really good product and every company should
have two or three copies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a significant
number of employees that don&#8217;t need it.&#8221; 
Google Apps 
Google says 3,000 businesses sign up each day for its apps.
The company lands a large corporate customer every few weeks,
mostly for the Gmail e-mail service, said Andrew Kovacs, a
Google spokesman. Recent new customers include packaging company
MeadWestvaco Corp. and Air France-KLM Group&#8217;s KLM unit, which
will have its 11,200 crew members use Gmail. 
Capossela said Office programs like Outlook and Word are
used by the bulk of workers at Microsoft&#8217;s corporate customers.
Most employees don&#8217;t want to switch to Google, he said.
Uploading a file to Google Apps often doesn&#8217;t preserve details
and formatting, Capossela said. 
Microsoft&#8217;s push into Web-based programs is motivated more
by customer demand than competition with Google, said Friar at
Goldman Sachs. Growth in software delivered as an Internet
service is going to outpace standard programs by 5-to-1, she
said. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a must for them to have done it -- the world is
moving to software as service,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest
shift in the software market.&#8221;

International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, seeking to boost earnings
by focusing on software and services, said he plans to spend $20
billion on acquisitions in the next five years. 
Operating earnings will jump to at least $20 a share by
2015 from $11.35 or more this year, helped by cost savings and
software demand, Palmisano said in a meeting with investors in
New York today. The company also predicted sales growth that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates, sending the stock higher. 
Palmisano is signaling his pace of acquisitions may be
accelerating. He spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases in
the eight years since taking over in 2002, partly to focus on
the higher-margin businesses of services and software. He has
also bought back shares and cut jobs to make up for slowing
corporate spending amid the recession. 
IBM will keep investing in markets that help customers be
more efficient, such as software that helps analyze or predict
trends and cloud computing, which lets them store and access
information on shared servers, Palmisano said. The company is
also developing services to monitor highways, electrical grids
and other infrastructure so they can be run more efficiently.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, said first-quarter profit surged on lower
writedowns and higher life premiums. 
Net income increased to 527 million euros ($668 million)
from 104 million euros a year earlier, when the results were
affected by 1.5 billion euros of writedowns related to equity
holdings, Generali said in a statement today. That beat the
477 million-euro median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;The group expects a full-year operating profit of about
4 billion euros,&#8221; Chief Executive officer Raffaele Agrusti said
on a conference call. The insurer also forecast &#8220;stable&#8221; non-
life premiums for the year and an &#8220;improvement&#8221; in margins at
the life business. 
Cesare Geronzi, named Generali&#8217;s new chairman last month,
wants to boost growth outside Italy. The insurer is already
expanding in emerging markets, including China and the Middle
East, and in eastern Europe as it seeks to recover from the
global financial crisis. 
&#8220;Although the macroeconomic climate remained difficult,
Generali was able to close the first quarter with strong
growth,&#8221; Geronzi said. &#8220;The group can continue to set
ambitious targets.&#8221; 
Storm Claims 
The non-life business, which was affected by rising claims
including many related to Europe&#8217;s winter storm Xinthia,
recorded gross premiums in the period of 6.6 billion euros. The
combined ratio increased to 98 percent in the three months to
the end of March, showing that the company&#8217;s insurance
underwriting is less profitable. Life premiums rose 19 percent
to 14.2 billion euros. 
Generali had &#8220;better results overall&#8221; because of new
life business and improved operating results at the life unit,
Atanasio Pantarrotas, an analyst at Cheuvreux, wrote in a note
to clients today. 
Generali&#8217;s &#8220;net exposure&#8221; to Greek government bonds is
810 million euros, Agrusti said, adding that the insurer has
800 million euros and 670 million euros of &#8220;exposure&#8221; to
Spanish and Portuguese government debt, respectively. 
Generali rose 0.4 percent to 15.74 euros at 5 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 24.6 billion euros.
The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index has dropped 1 percent
in the past six months, compared with Generali&#8217;s 13 percent
decline.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer services provider, projected
operating profit will jump to $20 a share by 2015, helped by
cost savings and demand for its software. 
Software will contribute almost half of the company&#8217;s
earnings, while new growth initiatives will add $20 billion to
sales, according to presentation slides on the company&#8217;s Web
site. IBM is meeting with investors in New York today. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing the
higher-margin businesses of services and software to boost
profit. He has has spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases
since taking over in 2002. He has also bought back shares and
cut jobs to help boost earnings. 
The company plans to save $8 billion through productivity
gains by 2015, while free cash flow should reach $100 billion.
IBM said it plans to give 70 percent of the cash flow to
shareholders. 
IBM also reiterated that earnings per share will grow more
than 10 percent this year, to at least $11.20. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, climbed $1.90, or 1.5
percent, to $128.79 at 10:24 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares had fallen 3.1 percent this year

As International Business Machines
Corp. meets with investors in New York today, some shareholders
want the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider to go beyond
profit goals and pledge itself to more specific sales growth. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano used the shareholder
briefing three years ago to establish a target of $10 in
earnings per share by 2010, a goal he has already reached. Some
investors expect him to set a similar benchmark this year, and
they want him to lay out specific plans for boosting sales at
more than the current low-single digit rate. 
&#8220;I want to see revenue growth,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, a
Cincinnati-based portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Management, who helps manage $13.3 billion, including more than
$100 million of IBM shares. &#8220;Sam Palmisano has come through the
storm, but where do we go from here? What&#8217;s next, Mr. Wizard?&#8221; 
Though investors give IBM credit for reaching the $10-a-
share profit mark a year early, many have sold shares, saying
profit growth may suffer without higher revenue gains. IBM&#8217;s
sales have been little changed in the past five years, while
sales at rival Hewlett-Packard Co. have risen more than 7
percent annually on average, in part because of acquisitions.
IBM&#8217;s earnings per share have been bolstered by stock buybacks
and jobs cuts, which some investors say may not be sustainable.

tighter fiscal policy will lower U.K. growth and that the Bank

&#8220;Sterling positive factors are now being offset by the

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, lost its challenge to a patent that led to a
change in its Word program and to damages of more than $290
million. 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office affirmed a patent
owned by i4i LP of Toronto after a review requested by
Microsoft, closely held i4i said in a statement yesterday. 
&#8220;Put simply: i4i&#8217;s patent is clearly and unequivocally
valid,&#8221; i4i Chairman Loudon Owen said in the statement. &#8220;Even
though Microsoft attacked i4i&#8217;s patent claims with its full
arsenal, the Patent Office agreed with i4i and confirmed the
validity&#8221; of the patent. 
I4i&#8217;s invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. 
&#8220;We are disappointed, but there still remain important
matters of patent law at stake, and we are considering our
options to get them addressed, including a petition to the
Supreme Court,&#8221; Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, said in an e-mail. 
Microsoft lost a jury trial over the patent last year and
was ordered to alter its Word program or halt sales. A U.S.
appeals court upheld both the verdict and the court order. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it&#8217;s used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files. 
The case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is i4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). 
Court Tells Patent Holder to Stop Suing PG, Kimberly-Clark 
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that
bars a Maryland patent owner from filing any new patent-
infringement cases against Procter  Gamble Co. and Kimberly-
Clark Corp. 
The Washington-based court, which hears appeals of patent
cases, told Allegra D. Hemphill that a trial court properly
rejected her infringement claims against the two consumer-
products companies as &#8220;baseless accusations.&#8221; 
Hemphill is the named inventor on patent 4,557,720, for a
disposable vaginal applicator. She claimed that personal hygiene
products such as Cincinnati-based PG&#8217;s Always, and Dallas-based
Kimberly-Clark&#8217;s Kotex and Poise infringed her patent, issued in
December 1985, according to court papers. 
Trial courts determined that the sanitary-napkin products
made by the consumer companies didn&#8217;t constitute &#8220;vaginal
swabs&#8221; as the term is used in the patent. 
Hemphill has made &#8220;hundreds of pages of largely repetitive
filings&#8221; that failed to support her case, and engaged &#8220;in a
vexatious pattern of filing multiple duplicative lawsuits,
forum-shopping among various district and appellate courts&#8221; the
appeals court said. The court said it is &#8220;apparent&#8221; that her
claims are without merit and &#8220;baseless.&#8221; 
The patent owner represented herself in the appeal. 
The case is Hemphill v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 10-01047,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). 
SABMiller Patents Easy-to-Open Beer Can That Doubles as Cup 
SABMiller Plc said it patented an easy-to-open beer can
that doubles as a cup after the entire top has been removed. 
The can is a first in the global beer industry and will be
used at the World Cup soccer tournament that starts in South
Africa next month, Norman Adami, managing director of the
Johannesburg-based unit, told reporters in the city yesterday. 
The brewer, which said it has invested 170 million rand
($22.6 million) in support of the World Cup, said in a statement
yesterday that it expects to sell the equivalent of 30 million
more bottles of beer during the tournament than it normally
sells in June and July in South Arica. 
Pesticide Management Bill Faces Opposition Over Data Monopoly 
India&#8217;s Bjaratiya Janta Party opposes a bill for pesticide
management currently under consideration, the Economic Times
reported. 
The party&#8217;s objection is to a section on pesticide-testing
&#8220;data exclusivity,&#8221; which it claims is the result of pressure
from U.S. chemical companies, the newspaper reported. 
The bill gives researchers a 20-year monopoly over their
data, which the party claims would make it difficult for generic
versions of the product to be created, according to the Economic
Times. 
Permitting data monopoly to go ahead may lead to higher
pesticide prices, a party leader told the Economic Times. 
Prisoner-Restraint Patent Issued to Utah Inventors 
Two Utah inventors received a U.S. patent yesterday for a
method of securing a prisoner to a motor vehicle. 
Patent 7,723,300 covers a device that can be hooked to the
prisoner&#8217;s handcuffs that will keep the prisoner&#8217;s hands behind
his back and prevent his escape from a police vehicle. 
According to the patent, the device can be triggered
remotely, and can be used even if the prisoner is placed in a
vehicle&#8217;s front seat. While the prisoner is tethered to the car
seat, &#8220;the police officer can then go about his other necessary
duties which may include: dealing with other suspects, searching
or inventorying a vehicle, talking with victims and witnesses.&#8221; 
The device can be used in conjunction with an automobile
seatbelt, and, in the event of a collision, can be released by
means of a remote-control switch, or cut with a knife or
scissors. 
The application for the patent was filed in March 2006 with
assistance from the Bateman IP Law Group of Salt Lake City. The
patent was issued to Keith D. Squires of Morgan, Utah, and Omar
L. Issa of Venice, Utah. 
Copyright 
Viacom, Indian Company Accused of Infringing Runyon Rights 
Viacom Inc. was sued for copyright infringement by the
owner of the copyright for a short story by the late Damon
Runyon. 
The lawsuit related to an Indian movie, &#8220;Singh is Kinng,&#8221;
which American Rights Management Co. of New York claims is
derived from Runyon&#8217;s &#8220;Madame La Gimp.&#8221; The 2008 Bollywood
film was directed by Anees Bazmee and starred Akshay Kumar and
Katrina Kaif. 
Viacom was sued as the film&#8217;s distributor. Vipul Amrutlal
Shah, producer of &#8220;Singh is Kinng&#8221; told Agence France-Presse
that he was &#8220;truly baffled&#8221; at the infringement allegations,
and the fact that the rights holder waited two years to file a
complaint. 
The Runyon story, originally published in 1929 in Hearst
Corp.&#8217;s Cosmopolitan magazine, is &#8220;generally recognizable by
the public&#8221; through several derivative films, Frank Capra&#8217;s
&#8220;Lady for a Day&#8221; and &#8220;Pocketful of Miracles,&#8221; and Jackie
Chan&#8217;s &#8220;Miracles,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
American Rights claims that the Bollywood film also
infringes the copyright for the two Capra films. 
The short story&#8217;s copyright holder claims the Bollywood
film is similar in essence, structure, pattern and sequence,
pace, setting, characterization and mood. The defendants
&#8220;purposefully employed immaterial variations or transparent re-
phrasing to produce essentially an update&#8221; of the Runyon story,
according to the complaint. 
American Rights asked the court to order the defendants to
quit infringing the copyright, including barring future
distribution of the film. Additionally, the rights holder
requested an award of money damages, litigation costs and
attorney fees, and extra cash compensation to punish the
defendants&#8217; for their actions. 
The rights holder is represented by Steven M. Hayes, of New
York&#8217;s Hanly Conroy Bierstein Sheridan Fisher LLP, and Clay M.
Townsend and Keith R. Mitnik, of Orlando, Florida&#8217;s Morgan 
Morgan PA. 
The case is American Rights Management v. Viacom 18 US,
1:10-cv-03690-VM, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan)). 
Trademark 
EA to Take Make &#8216;Spore&#8217; Darker, Trademark Application Hints 
Electronic Arts Inc., whose &#8220;Spore&#8221; was the most pirated
game in 2008, is taking the game to the dark side, if recent
trademark applications are any indication. 
The Redwood City, California-based games company filed four
applications to register &#8220;Darkspore&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office on May 3. 
Electronic Arts seeks to register the mark for a wide range
of goods and products including film production, online computer
games, action figures, playing cards, board games, pajamas, T-
shirts, and computer and video-game software. 
Newspaper Reveals Hidden Ownership of Bafana Bafana Brand 
A month before South Africa hosts the World Cup soccer
games, the country&#8217;s Times newspaper reported that Wayne Smidt,
a Johannesburg businessman, owns 49.9 percent of Slam, a company
that controls the trademark rights to Bafana Bafana, the
country&#8217;s national team. 
The South African Football Association owns the other 50.1
percent of the company, according to the Times. 
Smidt told the Times he objected to the newspaper&#8217;s
&#8220;drawing sinister motives&#8221; from his refusal to divulge more
information about the ownership or how much money he expected to
make during the World Cup games. 
Vivian Casaletti, Slam&#8217;s chief executive, said she expected
at least 1.6 million Bafana Bafana items to be sold, and that
the team licensing program  -- under which Slam makes 15 percent
on each item sold -- is &#8220;the most successful licensing program
in Africa,&#8221; according to the Times. 
Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Makeup of Chemical Dispersant Used in Gulf a Trade Secret 
Scientists and Louisiana fishermen say they are worried
about damage chemical dispersants may cause the region&#8217;s
fisheries and their lack of knowledge of the chemicals being
used, the U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph reported. 
More than 325,000 gallons of dispersants have been used on
waters in the Gulf of Mexico in efforts to halt the spread of
the oil that has been spewing from beneath the sea since the
April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig leased
by BP Plc, according to the Telegraph. 
The product used to break up the oil is Corexit, produced
by Nalco Holding Co.&#8217;s Nalco Energy Services, the newspaper
reported. 
LuAnn White, a Tulane University toxicologist, told the
Telegraph &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; what&#8217;s in the product &#8220;because it&#8217;s
a trade secret.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman denied allegations the U.S. bank misled
investors about mortgage derivatives it sold them. 
The firm is being probed by U.S. prosecutors over whether
the bank misled clients when it sold them collateralized debt
obligations as its own traders bet that the value of the
securities would drop, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
The New York-based firm hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the Justice
Department, Gorman told reporters in Tokyo today. 
Wall Street firms are facing unprecedented scrutiny from
lawmakers and prosecutors over whether they missold CDOs linked
to the subprime mortgages that caused the credit crisis. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. is fighting a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm misled investors
about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. 
&#8220;We should expect to see a whole slew of cases appear
through the rest of the year,&#8221; said Ralph Silva, an analyst at
London-based Silva Research Network, which specializes in
financial services firms. &#8220;Because they are near-impossible to
prove, I suspect most are going to be settled on the threat of a
perp walk.&#8221; 
The bank fell to $27.72 at 12:15 p.m. in German trading
from its $28.38 close in New York yesterday. The shares have
dropped 4 percent this year, compared with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financials Index&#8217;s 10 percent gain in the period. 
No &#8216;Substance&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley arranged and sold CDOs backed by home loans,
even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their value
would fall, the Journal said, citing traders. The investigation
is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly represented its
roles, according to the report. 
&#8220;We have no reason to believe there is any substance behind
any supposed investigation that appeared in the Wall Street
Journal article,&#8221; Gorman said at the press conference, convened
to discuss the firm&#8217;s Japanese securities and investment banking
ventures with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. 
Spokesmen for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office and the
SEC declined to comment, the Journal said. 
Government officials in the U.S. are seeking to assuage
public anger over bank bailouts by tightening regulations after
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis that led
to $1.78 trillion in writedowns and losses by financial firms. 
The probe stemmed from an ongoing civil-fraud investigation

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman denied allegations the U.S. bank misled
investors about mortgage derivatives it sold them. 
The firm is being probed by U.S. prosecutors over whether
the bank misled clients when it sold them collateralized debt
obligations as its own traders bet that the value of the
securities would drop, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
The New York-based firm hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the Justice
Department, Gorman told reporters in Tokyo today. 
Wall Street firms are facing unprecedented scrutiny from
lawmakers and prosecutors over whether they improperly sold CDOs
linked to the subprime mortgages that caused the credit crisis.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is fighting a lawsuit from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm
misled investors about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. 
&#8220;We should expect to see a whole slew of cases appear
through the rest of the year,&#8221; said Ralph Silva, an analyst at
London-based Silva Research Network, which specializes in
financial services firms. &#8220;Because they are near-impossible to
prove, I suspect most are going to be settled on the threat of a
perp walk.&#8221; 
The bank fell to $27.72 at 12:15 p.m. in German trading
from its $28.38 close in New York yesterday. The shares have
dropped 4 percent this year, compared with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financials Index&#8217;s 10 percent gain in the period. 
No &#8216;Substance&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley arranged and sold CDOs backed by home loans,
even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their value
would fall, the Journal said, citing traders. The investigation
is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly represented its
roles, according to the report. 
&#8220;We have no reason to believe there is any substance behind
any supposed investigation that appeared in the Wall Street
Journal article,&#8221; Gorman said at the press conference, convened
to discuss the firm&#8217;s Japanese securities and investment banking
ventures with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. 
Spokesmen for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office and the
SEC declined to comment, the Journal said. 
Government officials in the U.S. are seeking to assuage
public anger over bank bailouts by tightening regulations after
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis that led
to $1.78 trillion in writedowns and losses by financial firms. 
The probe stemmed from an ongoing civil-fraud investigation
of more than a dozen Wall Street firms&#8217; mortgage bond businesses
by the SEC that began in 2009, the newspaper said. The Manhattan
U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office is conducting a criminal probe into some

Morgan Stanley is being probed by U.S.
federal prosecutors over allegations it misled investors about
mortgage derivatives, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter that it didn&#8217;t identify. 
Investments known as collateralized debt obligations, or
CDOs, backed by home loans, were arranged and sold by Morgan
Stanley even as its trading desk would sometimes bet that their
value would fall, the newspaper said, citing traders. The
investigation is reviewing whether Morgan Stanley clearly
represented its roles, the WSJ said. 
The probe, which is at a preliminary stage, marks deepening
scrutiny of Wall Street firms by U.S. regulators following the
global financial crisis, the Journal said. Rival Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. is contesting a fraud lawsuit from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the firm
misled investors about a mortgage-linked security in 2007. 
&#8220;We have not been contacted by the Justice Department
about the transactions being raised by the Wall Street Journal,
and we have no knowledge of a Justice Department investigation
into these transactions,&#8221; Morgan Stanley spokesman Nick Footitt
said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News. 
Spokespeople for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office and
the SEC declined to comment, the Journal said.

Bonds sold by U.S. financial firms
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. offer value after a fraud
lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused spreads
to widen, according to BT Investment Management Ltd. 
BTIM, a manager of about A$13.5 billion ($12.1 billion) of
cash and fixed-income assets, has been buying bonds of U.S.
institutions such as Goldman Sachs that mature in about a year,
and is considering buying more, head of income strategies Scott Osborne and senior portfolio manager Jean-Luc Petit said in an
interview in Sydney. 
&#8220;Short-dated U.S. financial notes offer more bang for your
buck than their global peers,&#8221; said Osborne. &#8220;While the
spreads have widened on the recent SEC probe issues, the U.S.
economic recovery will underpin the strength of the financial
system in the medium term.&#8221; 
U.S. financial debt has lost almost 1 percent since the SEC
filed its suit against the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history on April 16, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows,
after handing investors profits in 11 of the 12 months ending
March. The lawsuit sparked concern the government will crack
down on Wall Street and hurt profits, even as the U.S. economy
recovers from the worst global recession since World War II.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
Street firm facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, named E. Gerald Corrigan and J. Michael Evans to oversee a new business standards committee. 
Corrigan, 68, joined the firm in 1994 after a 25-year
career at the Federal Reserve, culminating as president of the
New York Fed. Evans, 52, arrived in 1993 after 10 years at
Salomon Brothers, now part of Citigroup Inc., and is both a vice
chairman of the company and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia. The
panel will make a final report public after a December board
meeting, Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, announced plans to create the committee at
the firm&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting on May 7. He said the
panel, formed after the SEC lawsuit and a U.S. Senate grilling
of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top executives over their treatment of
clients, would make recommendations on how the firm could
reinforce its focus on clients and ethics. 
&#8220;This initiative is consistent with our obligation to
ensure that our standards across our business activities are of
the highest quality and represent the benchmark for the industry
globally,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, said in today&#8217;s statement. 
The committee will have 17 members, the firm said. They
include Chief Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder, who will
serve as the panel&#8217;s chief operating officer, and David Greenwald, the firm&#8217;s international general counsel and deputy
general counsel, who will provide legal advice. 
Cooper, Daffey, Gnodde 
The other members are: Edith Cooper, global head of human
capital management; Michael Daffey, global head of equities
sales and securities distribution in Europe; Richard Gnodde, co-
CEO of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s European business; David Heller, global

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will buy
Nexen Inc.&#8217;s North American natural-gas trading business for an
undisclosed price, reducing volatility in Nexen&#8217;s earnings. 
Nexen Vice President Pierre Alvarez confirmed the sale in
an e-mail today. The trading assets will be sold to J. Aron 
Co., the commodity-trading division of Goldman Sachs, Alvarez
said. Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, confirmed the sale and refused further comment. 
The sale is expected to be cash-neutral, Nexen said in an
April 30 filing, and the Calgary-based company said it would
likely report a $250 million to $290 million non-cash loss
associated with the sale. The company said in the filing its
marketing business has generated about $800 million in cash
during the last 10 years. 
&#8220;They probably had contracts that were loss positions that
these guys had to take, so as a result it was cash-neutral,&#8221;
said Kristopher Zack, an analyst with Raymond James Ltd. in
Calgary. 
While the sale won&#8217;t boost Nexen&#8217;s cash flow, it will
likely remove volatility from the oil exploration and production
company&#8217;s results, Zack said. 
Nexen sold its European gas and power-marketing business
earlier this year. The company was formed by Occidental
Petroleum Corp. when it combined its Canadian units in the early
1970s.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
securities firm that makes about 10 percent of its revenue from
trades on its own behalf, is ceasing proprietary trading in one
type of structured debt, according to a person close to the
firm. 
A group of traders who were focused on making bets on
collateralized loan obligations with the New York-based firm&#8217;s
own money are now handling trades for clients, the person said,
speaking anonymously because the plans aren&#8217;t public. CLOs are
bonds backed by pools of corporate loans. Andrea Rachman, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm, merged
the proprietary trading desk with the team that handles
transactions for clients as it wound down the positions in the
proprietary trading book, the person said. Both groups were run
by Gerald Ouderkirk, who was promoted to managing director in
October 2006. 
Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported on the
changes in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s CLO trading division in its May 14
issue. 
CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation, debt
instruments that repackage loans into securities of varying risk
that pay investors different yields. The market boomed in the
first half of the last decade, helping fuel a spree of leveraged
buyouts by providing demand for loans that helped reduce the
cost of funding. The market dried up in 2007 and 2008 as the
mortgage market crisis caused investors to flee from structured
credit into simpler and safer securities. 
The fair value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s retained interests in
CDOs and CLOS dropped to $367 million at the end of November
2008 from $1.97 billion two years earlier, according to company
filings.

who fielded a call from Dimon after helping lead protests
against his selection as commencement speaker. &#8220;Otherwise, it&#8217;s

More than 1,200 Syracuse students, alumni and supporters

General Motors Co. said slowing
growth in China won&#8217;t prompt the company, the largest overseas
automaker in the nation, to revise its 2010 sales forecast. 
GM sales in China will exceed 2 million vehicles this year,
said Kevin Wale, president of the company&#8217;s China operations, in
Ningbo, China, reiterating an earlier projection. Carmakers will
sell a combined 15.5 million vehicles in China in 2010, he said. 
China&#8217;s monthly car-sales growth slowed in April to the
lowest level since March 2009 amid rising consumer and property
prices. Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles increased 33 percent to 1.11 million from a year
earlier, compared with a 63 percent jump in March, the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said on May 10. 
Slowing growth is &#8220;a natural part of the industry cycle,&#8221;
Wale said today at a conference in Ningbo, a city in the eastern
part of China. &#8220;People need to manage it so they don&#8217;t end with
excess inventory. The market is still very strong. Underlying
demand is very strong.&#8221; 
China, which overtook the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest auto
market last year, has become GM&#8217;s largest market. The carmaker
aims to sell 3 million vehicles a year in China by 2015. It
plans to introduce 25 new or updated models in the country by
the end of 2011. 
In April, Detroit-based GM sold 213,115 vehicles in China.
The company and its ventures sold 1.83 million vehicles in the
country last year. 
The Chinese car market is &#8220;stabilizing, it&#8217;s not
continuing to grow at the rapid rate&#8221; of last year, Wale said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a good year for the industry, and a good year
for General Motors&#8221; in China.

malignancy, the authors said. That data, though, was flawed, the
authors concluded, saying that more study would be needed to
establish a definitive link. 
The report by the World Health Organization&#8217;s International
Agency for Research on Cancer is the latest in a series of
conflicting studies exploring whether a connection exists
between mobile phones and cancer. Most have failed to identify a
link. The debate has turned on the fact that the phones emit
radio waves and, at higher levels than that released by phones,
the emissions heat body tissue and spur tumors, according to the
National Cancer Institute&#8217;s website. 
&#8220;An increased risk of brain cancer is not established,&#8221;
said Christopher Wild, director of the International Agency for
Research on Cancer, in a statement. More studies are needed to
definitely rule out a link in the heaviest mobile-phone users to
malignancy, the researchers said. 
Brain Tumors 
The study participants included 5,117 patients who had
either a meningioma, a slow-growing brain tumor, or glioma, a
deadly type of brain tumor. They were matched with comparison
subjects who didn&#8217;t have brain cancer, and all were questioned
on their mobile phone use. 
Researchers found &#8220;suggestions&#8221; of a 40 percent higher
risk of glioma in those who were in the top 10 percent for the
longest cumulative call time, the study authors said. That risk
was greatest in people with brain cancer who reported that they
often held their phones on the same side of their head as their
gliomas developed, the authors said. 
The higher cancer risk seen in heaviest users may not be a
reliable finding because it was based on the amount of time
people remembered talking on their phones, according to the
study. Brain tumors can confuse thinking and affect memory,
which could influence the results. Researchers said a higher
proportion of people with gliomas were judged by their
interviewers to have poor memory. 
&#8216;Too Early&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still too early to say if there is a higher risk
because cancer, particularly brain cancer, can take years to
develop,&#8221; often longer than the 10 years of phone use in some
participants of the WHO study, said Henry Lai, a bioengineering
researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, in a
telephone interview. Lai, who has studied mobile phone safety,
wasn&#8217;t involved in the WHO research. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not beyond the realm of possibility that there&#8217;s a
link&#8221; between mobile phone use and cancer, said Peter Inskip,
senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Maryland. 
More study is needed to look at a possible link between
brain cancer and growing use of mobile phones by children,
Inskip said. &#8220;What we might have considered heavy use 10 years
ago might not be considered heavy use now,&#8221; he said. 
People in the study reported spending a median time of 2 to
2.5 hours a month on their mobile phones, the study said. The
heaviest users -- about 10 percent of the total -- said they
spent 1,640 cumulative hours on the phone. Participants reported
their use for periods ranging from one year to more than 10
years, according to the research. 
FDA Statement 
The study&#8217;s findings show little or no risk of brain tumors
for most long-term users of cell phones, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said today in a statement. 
&#8220;There are still questions on the effect of long-term
exposure to radio frequency energy that are not fully answered&#8221;
by the WHO study, Abiy Desta, network leader for science at the
FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said today in
the statement. &#8220;However, this study provides information that
will be of great value in assessing the safety of cell phone
use.&#8221; 
The FDA has the authority to require manufacturers to
notify consumers and repair, replace or recall mobile phones if
they are ever found to emit radiofrequency energy at a hazardous
level, according to a fact sheet on the agency&#8217;s website. 
Young People 
&#8220;Today, mobile phone use has become much more prevalent,
and it is not unusual for young people to use mobile phones for
an hour or more a day,&#8221; the WHO researchers said in a
statement. The increased use is partially offset by younger
people&#8217;s preference for hands-free calling, texting over phone
calls and lower emissions of some newer phones, the researchers
said. 
The study&#8217;s findings &#8220;are consistent with conclusions
reached in an already large body of scientific research on this
subject,&#8221; John Walls, a spokesman for CTIA-The Wireless
Association, a Washington-based trade group for the wireless
industry, said today in a statement. 
More than one-third, or $6.8 million, of the study&#8217;s $23.7
million cost came from the mobile-phone and other industry
sources, according to a news release from the World Health
Organization. The researchers came from 13 countries, including
Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel,
Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. No one
was involved from the U.S. 
&#8216;Not Established&#8217; 
The number of wireless accounts grew to 285.6 million in
December from 109.5 million in 2000, according to CTIA. The
number of U.S. households that only have wireless phones was
almost 23 percent in December, up from 8.4 percent in 2005, the
CTIA said. 
Previous studies include a December report by investigators
from the U.S. National Cancer Institute using cancer registries
in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, covering more than 16
million adults, to track the number of people diagnosed with
brain tumors since 1974, when mobile phone use in those
countries began seeing widespread use. The researchers found no
surge in brain cancer cases. 
A study of 420,000 Danish people who used mobile phones for
an average of 8.5 years, reported in December 2006, also found
no increase in cancers. 
Ramon Llamas, a phone-industry analyst at Framingham,
Massachusetts-based International Data Corp., suggested studying
the use of mobile phones going forward was a moving target. 
&#8220;No one wants to do something that endangers their health,
but consumer behavior on mobile phones is changing dramatically
already,&#8221; Llamas said in an interview. &#8220;Every carrier has seen
a dramatic change toward people texting and using data more,
which brings the phone away from the ear.&#8221; 
The newest study &#8220;illustrates how difficult it is to
identify and corroborate, or definitively rule out, any possible
association,&#8221; said John E. Niederhuber, director of the U.S.
National Cancer Institute.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
ended talks to hire Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP
to bolster its legal team. 
The discussions, which started earlier this month, were
terminated last week and Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t plan to hire
another law firm instead, a person briefed on the matter said,
speaking anonymously because the talks were private. 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
that the firm isn&#8217;t hiring Paul, Weiss. Madelaine Miller, a
spokeswoman for Paul Weiss, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking
comment. 
Goldman Sachs, which generated a record $13.4 billion
profit last year, was seeking additional legal advice as it
faces issues tied to its sale of mortgage-linked securities that
include the SEC suit and a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing last
month. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the firm&#8217;s
activities in the area, people familiar with the matter said
last month. 
The plan was to supplement, not replace, the company&#8217;s
current legal advisers including Sullivan  Cromwell LLP. 
Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of the Senate
hearing from K. Lee Blalack II of O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has
previously worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s chief counsel and staff
director. Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White
House counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. 
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 59 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$142.64 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
has dropped 15.5 percent this year, the most of the biggest six
banks in the U.S. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. reverse-
convertible note paying 64 percent annualized interest plunged
in value on May 14, three days after being sold, showing the
risks of these products usually bought by individual investors. 
The structured notes offered 10.7 percent in interest
payments over their two-month term and a return of principal, as
long as shares of TiVo Inc. didn&#8217;t fall more than 25 percent,
according to a prospectus. TiVo dropped 42 percent on May 14
after an adverse court ruling, triggering a provision that will
leave investors holding the possibly depressed stock at
maturity. 
Banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc
sold $656 million of reverse convertibles in the U.S. last
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities,
which combine features of bonds and stock options, are often
sold to individuals who don&#8217;t understand the risks, said Jake Zamansky, a New York-based attorney who represents investors. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s being sold as a bond, an income-generating product,
and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s being explained to people that you can
get stuck with the stock,&#8221; the securities lawyer at Zamansky 
Associates said in a telephone interview on May 14. He has
represented investors in lawsuits related to the products. 
Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
The prospectus&#8217;s listing of risk considerations includes the
statements &#8220;your investment in the notes may result in a loss&#8221;
and &#8220;your protection may terminate on any day.&#8221; &#8220;Protection&#8221;
refers to the feature where the principal is returned unless, on
any day, the stock closes 25 percent below its initial price. 
Receiving Stock 
Because that level was breached, noteholders will receive
at maturity as many shares of the stock as their investment
would have bought at the initial price, hence the name &#8220;reverse
convertible.&#8221; 
&#8220;Individuals should be buying reverse convertibles on
stocks that they otherwise would consider owning outright,&#8221;
said Keith Styrcula, chairman of the New York-based Structured
Products Association, in a telephone interview today. 
Investors in JPMorgan&#8217;s notes could make money if TiVo&#8217;s
share price recovers. The stock was up 5.8 percent, to $10.75,
at 1:09 p.m. today in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange,
compared with $16.88 when the notes were issued. 
JPMorgan sold $800,000 of the TiVo-linked products, it said
in the prospectus. The 64 percent interest rate was the highest
offered on any reverse convertible in months, according to Craig McCann, a Fairfax, Virginia-based litigation consultant who&#8217;s
preparing a study of the market. 
&#8216;Ridiculous&#8217; Commission 
The price of the securities included a 1.75 percent sales
commission, of which JPMorgan received 0.75 percentage point,
according to the prospectus. That&#8217;s 10.5 percent on an
annualized basis, which is much higher than the commission
charged on comparable investments, according to Seth Lipner, a
Garden City, New York-based attorney. 
&#8220;A 10.5 percent commission is ridiculous,&#8221; Lipner said in
a telephone interview on May 14. &#8220;The cost would be much
lower&#8221; for investors to make the same kind of market bet using
various options rather than reverse convertibles, he said. 
Structured notes generally include other costs, such as to
offset risks related to the security, as well as a profit for
the issuer. The built-in costs of the TiVo-linked note were
limited to the 1.75 percent commission, according to the
prospectus. 
Each $1,000 TiVo note was worth $945 on the day it was
offered, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s reverse-convertible pricing
model. McCann said his model came up with an initial value of
$960. Prices generated by the models vary based on the source of
market data and assumptions about liquidity and volatility. 
Court Case 
TiVo&#8217;s decline came after an appeals court said on May 14
it would reconsider the company&#8217;s victory over Dish Network
Corp. and EchoStar Corp. in a digital-video recording patent
case. Dish and EchoStar had asked on April 5 for the full panel
of the appeals court to rehear the case. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think something with a major development about to
take place, positive or negative, should be put into a reverse
convertible,&#8221; Zamansky said. &#8220;There&#8217;s just too much
volatility.&#8221; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s prospectus states that TiVo&#8217;s stock &#8220;has
experienced significant fluctuations.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mention the
pending patent case. 
Many investors who lost money on reverse convertibles have
filed arbitration claims against their brokers, according to
Zamansky. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a trade
group, said in a February letter to its members that reverse
convertibles can be &#8220;difficult for retail investors and
registered representatives to evaluate.&#8221; Brokers&#8217; sales pitches
must be &#8220;fair and balanced,&#8221; it said. 
Brokers often market reverse convertibles as a way for
individuals to take advantage of the sophisticated derivatives
trading that banks use, according to Chris Vernon, a Naples,
Florida-based attorney who represents structured-note investors. 
&#8220;The pitch with these complex structured products is that
this is what the big boys are doing and now you can do it too,&#8221;
Vernon said in a telephone interview on May 14. &#8220;But the big
boys aren&#8217;t paying 10 percent-plus commission per year.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. agreed to settle a
wrongful-death lawsuit alleging its Neurontin epilepsy medicine
caused a retired minister to commit suicide two months after he
started taking the drug. 
Lawyers for New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, told a judge in Nashville, Tennessee, they resolved
claims by the family of Richard Smith, which were set to go to
trial today. It&#8217;s the second settlement of claims that officials
of a Pfizer unit knew the epilepsy drug posed a suicide risk and
failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased the case has been resolved,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Aleta Trauger told lawyers for Smith&#8217;s family and
the company today. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Smith, 79, was a
retired Church of Christ minister, according to court papers. He
was taking the drug to deal with chronic pain, not epilepsy, the
filings show. 
Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. In March, a Boston jury ordered
Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to an insurer
over its marketing practices in connection with the drug. Pfizer
has denied any wrongdoing in connection with its handling of
Neurontin. 
&#8216;Great Sympathy&#8217; 
Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a $430
million fine. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. 
&#8220;We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the
Smith family to resolve this case as it avoids the time and
expense of a trial,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We have great sympathy for the Smith
family and respect their desire for privacy regarding the
outcome of the case.&#8221; 
By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Smith&#8217;s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. 
As part of the guilty plea, Warner-Lambert officials
acknowledged the company engaged in &#8220;deceptive off-label
marketing&#8221; of Neurontin, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said in 2004. 
&#8216;Snake-Oil List&#8217; 
A former Warner-Lambert medical liaison testified in an
earlier Neurontin suit he was trained to market the drug to
doctors for uses beyond those approved by regulators. Dr. David
Franklin, who won a $25 million whistleblower suit against the
drugmaker over the medicine, said he was given a &#8220;snake-oil
list&#8221; of unapproved uses to help pump up Neurontin&#8217;s sales.
Franklin had been set to testify in Smith&#8217;s case. 
Smith, who worked part-time as a service manager at a
Nashville office-machines store, began taking Neurontin in March
2004 to deal with chronic pain tied to back and neck surgeries,
according to court filings. Lawyers for his family say in the
filings that Warner-Lambert officials didn&#8217;t properly warn
Smith&#8217;s doctors the drug had been found to cause depression and
suicidal thoughts in some users. 
&#8216;Forgive Me&#8217; 
In May, Smith killed himself with a gunshot to the head,
according to the filings. In a note he left to his family, Smith
indicated he was tired of being in pain. 
&#8220;Forgive me; I cannot go on like this, I cannot have my
body, the temple of the Holy Spirit, cut on anymore,&#8221; Smith
said in the note. &#8220;I have talked to God all night and he
understands.&#8221; 
Lawyers for Smith&#8217;s family said he&#8217;d told relatives prior
to his suicide that the Neurontin &#8220;was making him feel not
himself,&#8221; according to court filings. &#8220;Mr. Smith&#8217;s death was
inexplicable to family members because Mr. Smith was a godly man
and he knew suicide was wrong,&#8221; they added in the filing. 
Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers countered in their filings Smith suffered
through &#8220;numerous surgeries&#8221; which left him dealing with
&#8220;increasing pain.&#8221; The retired minister told his family he
&#8220;wished he could die because of the pain and the depression,&#8221;
the filing added. 
The case is Ruby Smith v. Pfizer Inc., 05-cv-11515-PBS,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville).

Supertanker shipping rates may more
than double to $50,000 a day as the premium the third-month
futures contract holds over the front month encourages traders
to use the tankers to store crude, Morgan Stanley said. 
&#8220;With the forward price of crude oil surging, the amount
of vessels used for floating storage should coincidentally
increase, cutting available supply to the market and driving
freight rates up,&#8221; Ole Slorer, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said
in a report yesterday. 
The premium the third-month Brent crude contract holds over
the front month, a formation known as a contango, rose to $2.31
a barrel on May 13 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest level since Oct. 15, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s up from 55 cents on March 17. The contango was
$1.84 today. 
&#8220;At current contango levels, we calculate that the current
spread justifies VLCC rates above $50,000 per day,&#8221; Slorer
said. 
The average shipping rates for very-large crude carriers,
or VLCCs, was $22,281 a day as of May 14, according to the
London-based Baltic Exchange. The rate to ship oil to Japan from
the Middle East using VLCCs was $30,225. 
VLCCs can haul about 2 million barrels of oil.

of units.&#8221; 
The units were &#8220;getting back to normal&#8221; by midmorning

&#8220;It took some time for the power to be restored and then
it took us a little while to get the plant up and running
again,&#8221; Bailey said. &#8220;It does have a short-term impact, but
we&#8217;re not anticipating any measurable supply impacts out in the

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, is upgrading Hotmail to make it easier to manage
the flow of photos, videos and social-networking updates to a
user&#8217;s inbox. 
The new version, scheduled to be released in July or
August, is designed to allow easier document sharing and provide
a quick view of photos and videos at the top of e-mails. The
upgrade also helps users easily send photos, videos and other
media, along with Web links, to their contacts. 
Microsoft, which sells ads next to Hotmail inboxes, is
updating the service to attract users from rivals such as Yahoo!
Inc. and Google Inc. While Hotmail is the leading e-mail service
worldwide, it&#8217;s No. 2 in the U.S. behind Yahoo Mail, according
to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google&#8217;s Gmail, the
fastest-growing of the leaders, was third. 
&#8220;This update, I think, is the most significant one we&#8217;ve
ever done,&#8221; said Chris Jones, a corporate vice president at
Microsoft. &#8220;We are already second. We hope this is a product
that can take us to first.&#8221; 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 21 cents to
$28.60 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The shares have fallen 6.2 percent this year. 
With the Hotmail upgrade, users can quickly see whether
they have e-mails from friends and social networks, along with
messages about package shipments or appointments, without
sorting through the inbox. Another feature, called &#8220;sweep,&#8221;
lets users clean out or move a block of similar e-mails with a
few clicks of the mouse.

Morgan Stanley shareholders voted
against a proposal that would have required the chairman be an
independent director who hasn&#8217;t previously served as an
executive officer of the company. 
Shareholders rejected the plan today at the company&#8217;s
annual meeting in Purchase, New York, where they approved all of
management&#8217;s proposals and voted against all of the measures
proposed by shareholders, Chief Legal Officer Gary Lynch said. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s board of directors unanimously opposed the
idea, saying in the proxy that investors are best served by
&#8220;maintaining the flexibility to have any individual serve as
chairman of the board.&#8221; The proposal was submitted by the
Laborers National Pension Fund. Current Chairman John Mack, 65,
was also chief executive officer until this year, when James Gorman, 51, took over. 
In response to a shareholder at the meeting who said it
appeared Mack was still running the company, Mack said he would
quit if Gorman ever told him he was an obstacle. 
&#8220;I made it very clear to James Gorman that at any point if
I&#8217;m in his way, he needs to let me know and I&#8217;ll resign,&#8221; Mack
said. 
The meeting was held at the headquarters of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s wealth-management unit. Fewer than 75 outside
shareholders attended the one-hour meeting, including one woman
who was knitting throughout the proceedings. 
Board Re-Elected 
Shareholders voted to re-elect board members, and approved
38 million additional shares to be used for equity-based
compensation during the next year. Morgan Stanley said in the
proxy that the shares are needed to address calls from
regulators that a greater proportion of pay be comprised of
stock. 
Morgan Stanley executives have sent letters to shareholders
in the past month asking them to vote in favor of the proposal
on approving new shares. Two proxy advisory groups have come out
in opposition and four institutional shareholders have sent in
their votes against it, according to the website Proxy
Democracy. 
Shareholders approved 25 million shares at last year&#8217;s
meeting as the firm added thousands of employees from Smith
Barney, and Morgan Stanley said in a letter that it will likely
be back to request more shares in 2011. 
U.S. Rescue 
Morgan Stanley last month reported its largest quarterly
profit since 2007, as it recovers from the financial crisis that
included a $10 billion bailout from the government in 2008 and
the bank&#8217;s first annual per-share loss in 2009. Last year, it
repaid the taxpayer funds and took a controlling stake in a
joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage. 
The firm and competitors remain embroiled in a Securities
and Exchange Commission probe, started at least a year ago,
that&#8217;s examining whether Wall Street misled investors when
selling mortgage-linked securities. 
Gorman said today in an interview after the meeting that
the company hasn&#8217;t received any Wells notices or recent
subpoenas from the SEC and hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the
Department of Justice. Wells notices are issued by regulators to
inform companies of completed investigations that may have
discovered infractions. 
&#8216;Across the Spectrum&#8217; 
The agency has been looking for abuse &#8220;across the
spectrum,&#8221; enforcement chief Robert Khuzami said April 16, when
the SEC sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accusing the company of
fraud in the sale of a collateralized debt obligation. While
federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the market, Morgan Stanley
isn&#8217;t the subject of a formal criminal investigation, a person
familiar with the government&#8217;s review said last week. Goldman
Sachs is contesting the lawsuit. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s operating environment is &#8220;extremely
fluid&#8221; because of regulatory reform legislation being debated
in Congress and &#8220;various industrywide&#8221; regulatory probes,
Gorman said. He said regulators looking into practices from
several years ago is a &#8220;necessary consequence&#8221; of the
financial crisis and is &#8220;appropriate.&#8221; 
The financial industry needs to &#8220;acknowledge the mistakes
that were made in recent years&#8221; and work to regain trust of the
public, Gorman said. 
&#8220;We need to understand why people are so angry at Wall
Street,&#8221; he said. 
Morgan Stanley fell 38 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $26.73 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. The
shares have declined 9.7 percent this year, compared with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index&#8217;s 3.6 percent gain.

Pfizer Inc. will close eight
manufacturing plants and scale back operations at six other
sites worldwide, eliminating 6,000 jobs as part of a previously
announced plan to trim its workforce. 
The drugmaker plans to shut manufacturing operations over
the next five years at plants in Puerto Rico, Ireland, and
Rouses Point, New York. Operations at plants in Germany,
Ireland, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and U.S. will be cut back, the
New York-based company said in a statement today. 
The cuts are part of the more than 19,000 jobs Pfizer said
it would eliminate after its $68 billion acquisition last year
of Wyeth. Pfizer said it has spent the past six months reviewing
how to reduce the combined company&#8217;s manufacturing operations. 
Pfizer is slashing costs as it braces to lose patent
protection next year on the company&#8217;s top-selling Lipitor
cholesterol pill, which generated about a quarter of Pfizer&#8217;s
sales last year. The drugmaker has eliminated 48,000 positions,
or 38 percent of its total workforce, over the past six years. 
Pfizer fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $15.81 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its lowest price
since Aug. 14. 
The plants that will be closed include those in Caguas,
Puerto Rico; Carolina, Puerto Rico; Dublin; Loughbeg, Ireland;
Shanbally, Ireland; Rouses Point, New York; Richmond, Virginia;
and Pearl River, New York. 
Wyeth said in 2005 that it would sell the Rouses Point,
site. Research operations in Pearl River and Richmond won&#8217;t be
affected by the manufacturing cuts, Pfizer said. 
Operations will be downsized in Guayama, Puerto Rico;
Newbridge, Ireland; Andover, Massachusetts; Sanford, North
Carolina; Havant, U.K.; and Illertissen, Germany. 
&#8220;The restructuring of our global plant network is critical
to our efforts to remain competitive so that we can continue to
meet patient needs and expand the access and affordability of
our medicines,&#8221; said Pfizer&#8217;s head of manufacturing Nat Ricciardi in the statement.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, said its plan to drill a deep-water oil
well in the Gulf of Mexico called Hadrian has been delayed by a
U.S. moratorium on offshore drilling permits. 
Exxon moved a rig to a site in 6,941 feet (2,116 meters) of
water in anticipation of drilling the well before the moratorium
was imposed earlier this month, halting any additional work on
the project, said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based company. 
A U.S. Interior Department report issued today that
included Hadrian in a list of deep-water projects that began in
the week ended May 17 may have been referring to Exxon&#8217;s
preparatory work, Jeffers said. The moratorium on new permits
was declared after an April 20 explosion and fire aboard a
Transocean Ltd. rig that killed 11 workers and triggered subsea
oil leaks. 
Caryl Fagot, a spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s Minerals
Management Service, which produced today&#8217;s report, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a telephone message seeking comment. 
The agency&#8217;s weekly deep-water activity report also showed
Newfield Exploration Co. and ATP Oil  Gas Corp. began drilling
deep-water oil wells in the Gulf in the past week. 
Pyranees Drilling 
Keith Schmidt, a spokesman for Newfield, confirmed drilling
has begun on a well at the company&#8217;s Pyranees project in 2,095
feet of water. Isabel Plume, an ATP spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment on
the deep-water report. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Exxon dropped 48 cents to $62.79 as of 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Newfield fell
$1.07, or 2 percent, to $51.44. ATP declined 42 cents to $14.71
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
There are at least 37 deep-water drilling projects
operating in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico, the report
showed. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled
explorer, is overseeing the deepest, Chinook, in 8,850 feet of
water. 
BP Plc, the London-based company that was leasing the rig
that exploded, burned and sank last month, is drilling a relief
well to halt leaks in the one damaged in the disaster that
claimed 11 lives. It&#8217;s BP&#8217;s only active deep-water project,
according to the report.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. shareholders
rejected a proposal to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer currently held by Jamie Dimon, who gave
investors an upbeat outlook on the U.S. economy. 
The resolution to separate the positions failed to pass
with about 34 percent of the vote, according to a preliminary
tally given to investors at today&#8217;s annual meeting in New York.
All members of the board standing for election received at least
89 percent of the vote, said General Counsel Stephen Cutler.
More than a dozen homeowners with Chase mortgages and consumer
advocates, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson appealed to Dimon to
do more for borrowers seeking loan modifications. 
Dimon, 54, who has led the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets and its board for more than four years, told shareholders
&#8220;there&#8217;s a chance down the road&#8221; that the lender would
reinstate a stock-buyback program. When asked whether the firm
would consider repurchasing shares, he said &#8220;not quite yet.&#8221;
He said he hoped to reinstate the quarterly dividend, which was
cut to 5 cents in 2009, at 30 percent to 40 percent of earnings. 
&#8220;The economy is growing as we speak,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think
it&#8217;s better to wait when things are stable so we can pay a
dividend you can count on.&#8221; It was the company&#8217;s first public
meeting since posting a 55 percent increase in net income for
the first quarter to $3.33 billion. 
Votes on Proposals 
Shareholders also approved a resolution for an advisory
vote on executive compensation by more than 95 percent. They
backed by 54 percent a measure allowing investors to take
actions outside of the public-meeting process if they have the
written consent of a majority of shares outstanding. 
A proposal allowing anyone with at least 10 percent of
outstanding common stock to call shareholder meetings lost while
attracting 44 percent of the vote. Another proposal seeking more
detailed derivatives disclosures and stricter collateral
requirements won about 34 percent of the vote. 
&#8220;We already do substantially some of the things you&#8217;re
talking about, not all of them, but some of them,&#8221; Dimon told
Sister Barbara Aires, who spoke on behalf of the groups of nuns
and priests who submitted the derivatives proposal. Aires said
in an interview that the same proposal received similar support
from shareholders at Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Bank of America Corp. 
About two dozen borrowers came to the meeting and appealed
for help on their home loans. Dimon referred them to mortgage
specialists sitting outside to answer questions about specific
foreclosure cases and pending modifications. 
&#8220;This is a government program, so it&#8217;s not always up to
JPMorgan&#8221; in deciding who qualifies and who doesn&#8217;t for the
Home Affordable Modification Program, Dimon said.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., fighting a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the company of
misleading investors, is trying to persuade more Americans to
trust the firm with their retirement funds. 
The New York-based company is promoting alternative asset
funds and designing target-date funds that provide guaranteed
income to grab a bigger piece of the $2.7 trillion 401(k)
market, said Bill McDermott, a managing director at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management and head of its defined-contribution
business. 
&#8220;We understand risk and we understand asset allocation,&#8221;
said McDermott, who joined the firm in February to strengthen
its retirement-plan products and marketing. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking to
leverage that for the 401(k) market.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s 401(k) plan assets totaled $17.5 billion as of
March 31, according to the company. Fidelity Investments, the
largest 401(k) asset manager, had $347.8 billion as of December
31. Assets in 401(k) plans are estimated to increase 41 percent,
to $3.8 trillion, by the end of 2014, according to data from
Cerulli Associates in Boston. 
Goldman and BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s largest asset
manager, don&#8217;t administer retirement plans and have been seeking
more 401(k) business. The business has been dominated by firms
such as Boston-based Fidelity and Vanguard Group, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, which administer plans as well as
manage assets.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, agreed to pay VirnetX Holding Corp. $200 million
and license technology to communicate privately over the
Internet, ending a patent dispute. 
&#8220;We believe that this successful resolution of our
litigation with Microsoft will allow us to focus on the upcoming
pilot system&#8221; for a virtual private network, Chief Executive
Officer Kendall Larsen said yesterday in a statement. 
VirnetX, which won a $105.8 million jury verdict in its
patent-infringement lawsuit in March, was seeking a court order
to block Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft from continuing to
use the technology in its Windows operating system and
Communications Server. The jury award also could have been
tripled by the court&#8217;s judge. 
Microsoft argued at trial that the patents were valued at
no more than $15 million. Investors bet the patents were worth
more, driving Scotts Valley, California-based VirnetX&#8217;s share
price up almost 300 percent in the past 12 months. VirnetX had a
market value of $267.9 million, based on the May 14 price. 
VirnetX had been public in its desire to be bought to
resolve the dispute. The agreement in which it obtained the
patents from defense contractor SAIC Inc. included a provision
that SAIC would get 10 percent of any proceeds if VirnetX were
acquired by Microsoft, according to a company regulatory filing. 
The patents relate to use of a domain-name service to set
up virtual private networks, through which a website owner can
interact with a customer in a secure way or an employee can work
at home and access a company&#8217;s files. The technology stemmed
from work performed for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to
develop secure communications, VirnetX said. 
After winning the trial, VirnetX filed another lawsuit
against Microsoft in the same court, arguing that Windows 7 also
infringed the patent. 
The Windows 7 case is VirnetX v. Microsoft Corp., 10cv94,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). The
older case is VirnetX Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 07cv80, in the
same court. 
Hyundai Motor Wins Reversal of $34 Million Patent Verdict 
Hyundai Motor Co. won its appeal of a $34 million verdict
that said South Korea&#8217;s largest automaker infringed a Texas
company&#8217;s patent for computerizing the sale of car parts. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit yesterday
said Orion IP LLC&#8217;s patent was invalid and vacated the verdict.
The opinion was posted on the court&#8217;s website. 
&#8220;There is insufficient evidence to support the jury&#8217;s
verdict&#8221; in Orion&#8217;s favor on the question of validity, the
three-judge court panel ruled. 
Orion, a patent-licensing firm based in Longview, Texas,
had sued 20 automakers, claiming infringement of a patent for a
way to help a salesperson select auto parts without relying on
catalogs or order forms. The other auto companies settled before
the 2007 trial in Tyler, Texas. 
Hyundai argued that companies other than Orion had come up
with the idea of electronic parts catalogs in 1987, and the
patented computer-assisted system a year later wasn&#8217;t different
enough to be considered a new invention. The Federal Circuit
agreed. 
Following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Leonard Davis
ordered Seoul-based Hyundai to pay a 2 percent royalty on parts
revenue generated through its website or dealer communication
system after June 19, 2007. 
The case is Orion IP LLC V. Hyundai Motor America, 2009-
1130, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Orion IP LLC v. Mercedes-
Benz USA LLC, 05cv322, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas (Tyler). 
Sanofi-Aventis Wins Patent Case Against Mylan in Delaware Ruling 
Mylan Pharmaceutical Inc. extended-release bladder tablets
will infringe on asserted claims of a patent held by Sanofi-
Aventis known as the 491 patent, according to May 14 decision by
a federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. 
The May 14 decision concerned Mylan&#8217;s proposed 10 mg
extended release alfuzosin hydrochloride tablets. The drug is an
alpha1-blocker that relaxes the smooth muscle in the lower
urinary tract, including bladder neck and prostate, to treat
illnesses of the prostate. 
The 491 patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
office April 28, 1987, to Synthelabo, a predecessor of Sanofi-
Aventis, the court wrote in the decision. 
Mylan filed its application in 2007. The court found that
Sanofi-Aventis showed by weight of the evidence that Mylan
&#8220;literally infringes&#8221; the asserted claims of the 491 patent. 
The case is In re Alfuzosin Hydrochloride Patent
Litigation, 08-md-1941, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). 
Chrysler Seeks to Block Imports of China&#8217;s Jeepzter Knockoff 
Chrysler Group, the U.S. automaker run by Fiat Spa, filed a
trade complaint to block U.S. imports of the Jeepzter, a car it
calls a knockoff of its Jeep off-road vehicle. 
Chrysler filed a complaint May 14 with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington against Xingyue
Group Co., claiming the Chinese company is making a vehicle that
copies a patented design for the Jeep Hurricane. The Hurricane,
shown as a concept car by Chrysler at the 2005 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit, was never mass produced. 
The Jeepzter &#8220;is the same or substantially the same to the
eye of the ordinary observer as the ornamental design&#8221; covered
by the patent, Chrysler said in the complaint. 
Chrysler, whose U.S. sales plummeted 36 percent last year,
is refreshing models including the Jeep Grand Cherokee as part
of a turnaround of its Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands. 
Chrysler also filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit in
federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 11 against
three companies selling Jeepzters in the U.S. That case claims
the companies are selling vehicles that copy the grille design
of the Jeep Wrangler. 
Noel Farbman, president of USA Wholesale Scooters in
Florida, said he took ads for the Jeepzter off his website as
soon as he heard of the lawsuit. He said he sold three of the
vehicles before learning of Chrysler&#8217;s complaint. 
Wade Liu, manager of Excalibur Motor Sports in Chino,
California, one of the companies named in the ITC complaint,
said he hadn&#8217;t yet received any of the Jeepzters and planned to
pull ads off his company&#8217;s website. 
Also named in the ITC case were three other businesses in
Tennessee, Texas and North Carolina that advertised the
vehicles, as well as importers connected to Xingyue. Efforts to
reach Xingyue&#8217;s U.S. offices in California were unsuccessful. 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Automotive
Vehicles and Designs Thereof, 2734. The civil suit is Chrysler
Group LLC v. USA Wholesale Scooters Inc., 10cv60774, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).

Coach Reaches Settlement in Suit on Alleged Design Infringement 
Coach Inc. said it settled a copyright infringement suit

defendant, was filed in federal court in New York. Terms of the
settlement are confidential, according to a statement released

Cable Companies Lose at High Court on Must-Carry Rule 
The U.S. Supreme Court, refusing to reconsider a
longstanding cable industry complaint, left intact a federal
requirement that providers include local broadcast stations in
their channel lineups. 
The high court yesterday rejected an appeal from New York-
area cable provider Cablevision Systems Corp., which objected on
free-speech grounds to a requirement that it make a local
station available to customers on Long Island. 
The appeal sought to overturn 1994 and 1997 Supreme Court
decisions that upheld the must-carry rule, which Congress
enacted in 1992 to protect the broadcasting industry from the
growing power of cable TV networks. Cablevision, backed by Time
Warner Cable Inc. and an industry trade group, said the
rationale behind the must-carry rule no longer exists, in part
because satellite services have captured more of the TV market. 
The issue is pitting the cable industry and some program
providers against broadcasters and the Obama administration,
which is defending the must-carry requirements. 
In urging the high court not to hear the case, U.S.
Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued that cable systems now have
far greater channel capacity than they did in the 1990s. 
The case is Cablevision Systems v. FCC, 09-901, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington).

Morgan Stanley co-chief global
economist Joachim Fels said there&#8217;s a risk of some nations
eventually breaking away from the 16-member euro region should
the response to the debt crisis lead to &#8220;fiscal instability&#8221;
and sustained pressure on the currency. 
If there&#8217;s &#8220;further weakness and a rise in inflation
pressures, then some of the more stability-minded European
countries might decide to break away,&#8221; Fels told Bloomberg
Television in an interview from London today. &#8220;Clearly that&#8217;s a
long-term story, not a story for now.&#8221; 
The euro remained close to a four-year low against the
dollar today, partly on concern that the almost $1 trillion aid
package European Union ministers agreed to last week won&#8217;t keep
the fiscal crisis from spreading. The EU today transferred 14.5
billion euros ($18 billion) to Greece, the first installment to
help restore investor confidence and prevent a sovereign
default. 
The euro fell as much as 0.7 percent today to $1.2315 and
was little changed at $1.2420 at 12:16 p.m. in London. 
Greece has pledged to implement austerity measures of
almost 14 percent of gross domestic product in exchange for the
rescue funds that EU officials hoped would stem declines in the
euro and stop the crisis from spreading to other countries such
as Spain and Portugal. Luxembourg&#8217;s Jean-Claude Juncker, who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said today that
there are &#8220;good reasons to believe&#8221; Greece is on the right
path. 
Still, Fels said that the rescue package may &#8220;create more
emergencies&#8221; over the medium term. If governments know that
there&#8217;s a &#8220;fund to bail them out eventually,&#8221; they&#8217;ll &#8220;pursue
a more expansionary fiscal policy,&#8221; he said. 
Europe is on a &#8220;slippery slope now toward more fiscal
instability,&#8221; he said. 
Spain and Portugal this month announced additional budget
cuts to tame the region&#8217;s third- and fourth-biggest deficits
after their bonds plunged. 
&#8220;What I am worried about is that those countries that are
tightening fiscal policy account for less than 20 percent of
euro-area GDP,&#8221; Fels said. &#8220;I think we have to look at the
large countries in the core, especially France and Germany,
where I see no signs whatsoever of fiscal tightening and these
countries account for more than half of euro-area GDP.&#8221;

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks to sell
its Australian service stations after a proposed A$300 million
($262 million) deal with Caltex Australia Ltd. was blocked by a
regulator. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not our business model,&#8221; Exxon Mobil Australia
Chairman John Dashwood said in an interview in Brisbane today.
&#8220;I guess the distinction I make is, are you an oil and gas
company or are you a groceries company? The industry has changed
to the point where the two meld, and some have used the shop to
move fuel. We&#8217;re not in the business of being a shop.&#8221; 
The deal to buy 300 filling stations would have increased
Caltex&#8217; ability to compete for fuel sales with BP Plc and
supermarket chains Woolworths Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd.&#8217;s Coles.
Exxon Mobil Australia wants to focus on natural-gas projects,
with plans to spend &#8220;many billions of dollars&#8221; in Australia
and Papua New Guinea in three to five years, Dashwood said. 
The biggest U.S. energy company is operator of a $15
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea and is
a partner in the $38 billion Gorgon venture in Australia led by
Chevron Corp. Exxon is also developing the Turrum and Kipper gas
ventures, which it estimates will cost A$3 billion. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a substantial amount relative to what we&#8217;ve been
investing here&#8221; over the past five years, Dashwood said,
declining to give a specific figure for the company&#8217;s spending
in Australia. &#8220;It&#8217;s a re-energizing of the organization.&#8221; 
Kipper, Turrum 
Exxon aims to decide in 2010 how to develop the Scarborough
gas field 300 kilometers (185 miles) off the coast of Western
Australia, he said. The project is a joint venture with BHP
Billiton Ltd. 
The budgets and schedules for Turrum and Kipper off
southeastern Australia are &#8220;under review,&#8221; partner BHP
Billiton said in April. Santos Ltd., which owns 35 percent of
Kipper, said this month that first gas from the project has been
delayed until the second half of 2011 due to &#8220;design issues.&#8221; 
While the timeline has &#8220;probably shifted a little bit,&#8221;
Exxon has not strayed from its 2011 target, Dashwood said today
on the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and
Exploration Association conference. 
Caltex Australia, the nation&#8217;s biggest oil refiner,
scrapped plans to buy Exxon Mobil&#8217;s filling stations after the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission opposed a
transaction that would have given the company an estimated 22
percent of the country&#8217;s branded fuel market. The regulator said
in December it was concerned the deal would lead to higher
prices. 
&#8220;We jointly decided we wouldn&#8217;t proceed with that deal,&#8221;
Dashwood said. &#8220;In the meantime we&#8217;ve got to operate those
facilities. We&#8217;ll see where commercial discussions take us.&#8221; 
He declined to reveal the potential buyers.

Microsoft Corp. filed two lawsuits to
combat what it says is a previously unknown form of pay-per-
click fraud on its adCenter network that has cost advertisers
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
The company alleged that RedOrbit Inc., a Texas operator of
a website about science-related topics, its president and
unidentified defendants have used technical measures to make
invalid ad clicks appear to have originated from legitimate
sources, according to a Microsoft statement. 
With click fraud, a company inflates the number of times an
ad is clicked on, often boosting advertising costs for a
competitor. In some cases, a website operator uses the technique
to increase its own revenue. Microsoft said RedOrbit&#8217;s actions
represent &#8220;click laundering,&#8221; a form of the practice designed
to evade fraud detection systems. 
&#8220;These are indications of the increasing sophistication&#8221;
of click fraud, said Jim Jansen, an associate professor of
information sciences at Penn State in University Park,
Pennsylvania. &#8220;It highlights that the ad platforms cannot get
complacent.&#8221; 
In the past, advertisers have sued companies, such as
Google Inc., that make money based on the number of times Web
users interact with online advertisements. Google, the most-used
Internet search engine, agreed in 2006 to pay $90 million to
settle a lawsuit with companies that said they paid for clicks
on ads that had no chance of generating sales. 
&#8216;Best Defense&#8217; 
Microsoft&#8217;s legal moves suggest Internet companies are
taking a more proactive role in cracking down on click fraud,
said Laurence Pulgram, a lawyer at Fenwick  West in San
Francisco. 
&#8220;This is a case of the search engine deciding the best
defense is a good offense, so the advertisers won&#8217;t be blaming
them,&#8221; Pulgram said. 
Microsoft said investigators uncovered the fraud following
&#8220;dramatic and irregular growth in click traffic&#8221; on two sites
within its adCenter network. 
RedOrbit.com click traffic increased from 75 clicks a day
to 10,000 clicks over a three-month period, according to one of
two complaints filed in federal court in Seattle by the Redmond,
Washington-based company, the world&#8217;s largest software maker. 
&#8220;It is RedOrbit&#8217;s policy not to comment on pending
litigation,&#8221; said Eric Ralls, founder of RedOrbit, listed as
the defendant in one of the lawsuits. &#8220;However, we do not, nor
have we ever, engaged, assisted in, or condoned click fraud. We
are disappointed that Microsoft has made these completely
baseless allegations, and intend to defend against them
vigorously.&#8221; 
Mask the Masking? 
Richard Boscovich, a senior attorney with Microsoft, says
Ralls figured out how to trick adCenter into making clicks that
weren&#8217;t valid look as though they had come from a legitimate
site. 
&#8220;We found that he&#8217;d done something that was thought to be
technically unfeasible,&#8221; Boscovich said. While many websites
have used methods to mask the true source of traffic, &#8220;he was
able to mask the fact that he was masking.&#8221; 
Google said it has taken steps to root out click fraud,
including in cases where the traffic is automated. 
&#8220;We design our systems to catch bot-related attacks,&#8221;
said Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
based Google. &#8220;Because a significant amount of malicious
traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds
of attacks.&#8221; 
The cases are Microsoft v. Eric Ralls, 10-818, and
Microsoft v. John Does, 10-820, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington (Seattle).

The move by General Electric Co. and
several Wall Street banks to salvage a Chicago lender with White
House ties prompted Republicans to demand that the Obama
administration answer questions about any role it may have
played in the rescue. 
ShoreBank Corp., which needs about $200 million in
additional capital to stave off regulators, also is receiving
help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., the Chicago Tribune
reported. Representative Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican
on the House Financial Services Committee, said they were doing
so to gain favor with the administration. 
&#8220;Some believe that ShoreBank was really saved because of an
assumption that high-ranking officials in the Obama
administration favored a bailout of this failing institution
with deep political ties,&#8221; Bachus, an Alabama lawmaker, said in
a letter he sent to President Barack Obama. 
General Electric said yesterday it&#8217;s investing $20 million
in the community bank, which is based on Chicago&#8217;s South Side
and has long-standing ties to the president. After Obama was
elected, former ShoreBank executive Robert Weissbourd served on
the president-elect&#8217;s transition team. 
&#8220;There is no way a bank without ShoreBank&#8217;s political
connections would receive this kind of attention,&#8221; Bachus said
in a statement. 
White House Question 
Administration officials haven&#8217;t met with ShoreBank about
its efforts to raise capital nor asked other lenders to provide
it with &#8220;financial assistance,&#8221; Amy Brundage, a White House
spokeswoman, said in a statement. 
The bank, a 1970s-era pioneer in lending to low-income
neighborhoods, has raised more than its target of $125 million
in private capital, said Brian Berg, a ShoreBank spokesman. The
remaining money may come from government funds, he said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re still looking into what Bachus is asking for,&#8221;
Berg said. 
Bachus&#8217;s letter to the president also was signed by
Republican Representative Judy Biggert of Illinois. They said it
is unfair for a &#8220;politically connected hometown bank&#8221; to get
assistance as others are closed by regulators. 
The Republicans urged the White House to release all
communication records that may exist between the administration
and financial executives involved in helping ShoreBank. 
&#8220;The investment is consistent with our focus on small- and
medium-sized businesses, and it is a valuable community bank,&#8221;
GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson said yesterday. GE Capital, the
Stamford, Connecticut-based unit of GE, makes loans to
businesses through its commercial lending and leasing division. 
Goldman&#8217;s Role 
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment. 
Goldman has agreed to invest $20 million in ShoreBank and
never had contact from the White House on the matter, said a
person familiar with Goldman&#8217;s involvement. The firm&#8217;s
connections were through Ellen Seidman, who is on ShoreBank&#8217;s
board and is a founding member of the advisory council of a
Goldman small-business initiative, as well as former U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and Sheila Bair,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the person
said.

Roy Bostock, the Morgan Stanley
director whose re-election was opposed by proxy advisory groups,
received the highest percentage of negative shareholder votes
among directors elected at the annual meeting. 
Bostock, the chairman of Yahoo! Inc., faced opposition from
35 percent of shareholders&#8217; votes yesterday, the New York-based
firm said today in a regulatory filing. Last year, about 29
percent of shares were voted against his re-election. 
About 27 percent of shareholders&#8217; votes supported a
proposal that would have required the company&#8217;s chairman be an
independent director who hasn&#8217;t previously served as an
executive officer of the company, the bank said. Current
Chairman John Mack, 65, was also chief executive officer until
this year, when James Gorman, 51, took over. 
Shareholders approved all management proposals and rejected
all measures proposed by shareholders at the meeting in
Purchase, New York. 
Bostock&#8217;s re-election was opposed by Glass Lewis and
RiskMetrics because he serves on the nominating and governance
committee even though his son-in-law, Daniel Waters, is co-CEO
of FrontPoint Partners, an asset-management division of Morgan
Stanley. Bostock has served on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s board since
2005. 
About 35 percent of shares were voted against approving 38
million additional shares to be used for equity-based
compensation during the next year. That compares with 36 percent
that were voted against approving 25 million shares at last
year&#8217;s meeting.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Global
Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said that while Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has
eased the euro&#8217;s &#8220;overvaluation,&#8221; policy makers may have to
take coordinated steps to shore up the currency. 
&#8220;People need to remember that for the past couple of years
the euro&#8217;s been very expensive,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill told Bloomberg Radio
from London today. Still, the euro&#8217;s recent slide indicates
expectations that monetary union could unravel, &#8220;so, there
needs to be something done by European policy makers to
stabilize the euro in the near future,&#8221; he said. 
The euro has shed 15 percent against the dollar this year
on concern a Greek fiscal crisis will spread across the 16-
member currency region. While European leaders last week pledged
a rescue package worth almost $1 trillion and the European
Central Bank started purchasing government bonds, investors
remain concerned about nations&#8217; ability to push down deficits. 
The euro remained near a four-year low against the dollar
today, trading at $1.2292 at 1:45 p.m. in London. It dropped as
low as $1.2144 today, the lowest level since April 17, 2006. 
Greece on May 18 received the first installment of a
European Union aid package allowing it pay back 8.5 billion
euros of bond maturing today and avoid default. The government
pledged 30 billion euros of budget cuts to secure the aid and
pledged to reduce the budget gap to 8.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 13.6 percent in 2009.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. racked up
trading profits for itself every day last quarter. Clients who
followed the firm&#8217;s investment advice fared far worse. 
Seven of the investment bank&#8217;s nine &#8220;recommended top
trades for 2010&#8221; have been money losers for investors who
adopted the New York-based firm&#8217;s advice, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from a Goldman Sachs research note sent
yesterday. Clients who used the tips lost 14 percent buying the
Polish zloty versus the Japanese yen, 9.4 percent buying
Chinese stocks in Hong Kong and 9.8 percent trading the British
pound against the New Zealand dollar. 
The struggles for analysts at Goldman Sachs, which is 
fighting a fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators who accuse the
company of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked security, 
show the difficulty of predicting market movements as widening 
budget deficits, a fragile global economic recovery and tighter
financial regulations increase volatility. Stock and currency
fluctuations rose to the highest in a year this month as Europe
pledged about $1 trillion to stop a debt crisis in the region. 
&#8220;This says that Goldman&#8217;s guys are only human,&#8221; said Axel Merk, who oversees $500 million as president and chief
investment officer of Merk Investments LLC in Palo Alto,
California. &#8220;No one is always right. There are a lot of cross
currents in this market.&#8221; 
Gia Moron, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
China&#8217;s Bear Market 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading profits come from capturing bid-
offer spreads when its traders act as intermediaries for
clients, Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s president and chief operating
officer, said last week in New York. Proprietary trading isn&#8217;t a
main driver of earnings, he said. 
The trade advice for customers is distributed by Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s global markets economic research group. It tracks the
performance of the trades in a daily research note. The time
period of the recommendations is 12 months. 
The performance this year is a reversal from 2009, when
nine of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 11 trading recommendations made money.
Investors saw a 22 percent return owning Chinese stocks and a 12
percent gain buying the British pound versus the dollar,
according to a Goldman Sachs note on Dec. 1. 
Goldman Sachs analysts made eight trade recommendations for
this year in December, including telling clients to buy the
British pound against the New Zealand dollar. On April 1,
Goldman Sachs added a ninth &#8220;top&#8221; trade, telling clients to
buy Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong and predicting the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index would rise 19 percent to 15,000. 
Tough Analysis 
Since then, the gauge has slid 9.4 percent to 11,426.18.
The Shanghai Composite index has entered a bear market, losing
about 21 percent this year. That&#8217;s the third biggest decline in
the world after Greece and Cyprus. The decline accelerated this
month on concern Greece, Spain and Portugal will struggle to
finance their budget deficits and dismantle the euro. 
The Chinese stock recommendation was made by a group led by
Dominic Wilson, a senior Goldman Sachs economist in New York.
Wilson cited inexpensive valuations and &#8220;robust&#8221; economic
growth. He also said investors have already factored in the risk
of higher interest rates in China. 
Wilson wasn&#8217;t available to comment because he was out of
the office traveling, according to an e-mail. 
Exit Calls 
&#8220;Emerging markets appear superior to the developed world,
but the market isn&#8217;t trading that relationship,&#8221; said Eric Fine, who manages Van Eck Associates Corp.&#8217;s G-175 Strategies
emerging-market hedge fund. &#8220;It may be that some assets are
mispriced, but if the market starts to discount the end point of
the game, such as the collapse of the euro, it&#8217;s not that
mispriced.&#8221; 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs recommended investors exit two
trades in February, one involving interest-rate swap rates in
the U.K. and another advising clients to buy credit-default
swaps in Spain and sell similar contracts in Ireland. The first
trade had a potential loss of 24 basis points and the other had
a return of 2.9 percent, according to figures issued in the
appendix of the research note in February. 
Owning currencies that are tied to growth is the only
remaining trade that has increased in value this year, according
to Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs FX Growth Index
has climbed 3.4 percent since the firm made the recommendation
in December. 
Betting on Markets 
Goldman Sachs makes more money from trading than any other
Wall Street firm. In the first quarter, the bank&#8217;s $7.39 billion
in revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities
dwarfed the $5.52 billion made by its closest rival, Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. In equities, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s $2.35 billion in revenue was about 50 percent higher
than its nearest competitor. 
Cohn told investors at a May 11 conference in New York that
the firm lost money on only 11 days in the last 12 months. He
said that uncanny streak of success refutes suspicions that the
bank depends on proprietary bets with its own money. 
&#8220;It is implausible that a proprietary-driven business
model could be right 96 percent of the time,&#8221; Cohn said.
Instead, he said the &#8220;simple answer&#8221; is that the firm makes
money by capturing bid-offer spreads when acting as an
intermediary for client trades. 
Goldman Sachs executives have grappled before with
questions about whether they&#8217;re better at making money for the
firm than for their clients, according to an internal e-mail
dated Sept. 26, 2007, that was released by a U.S. Senate
subcommittee last month. 
U.S. Lawsuit 
The e-mail to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein from
Peter Kraus, who was then co-head of the company&#8217;s investment-
management division, explains that individual investors, unlike
institutional clients, occasionally make &#8220;comments like ur good
at making money for urself but not us.&#8221; 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit
against Goldman on April 16 accusing the company of misleading
investors in a mortgage-linked asset. Goldman denies those
allegations and said it will fight the charges.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit
Suisse Group Inc. cut profit and share-price estimates for
Chinese property companies, citing a government clampdown on
speculation to avoid asset bubbles. 
Goldman Sachs, ranked second for Asian property coverage by
Institutional Investor magazine, lowered its 2010 net income
estimates by an average 13 percent and reduced earnings
forecasts for the next two years by 25 percent, analysts led by
Yi Wang wrote in a report today. Credit Suisse pared earnings-
per-share estimates by as much as 15 percent for 2010 and 20
percent for 2011. 
The MSCI China Real Estate Index&#8217;s 16 companies have
slumped an average 23 percent this year as the central bank
raised bank reserve requirements three times, while the
government raised down payment requirements for second homes and
banned loans for third homes. The slump in property stocks
outpaced the 9.5 percent drop in the broader MSCI China Index
that tracks mostly Hong Kong-traded stocks. The brokerages also
slashed share-price targets by as much as 57 percent. 
&#8220;In view of the revised tightening measures since mid-
April, we turn more cautious on the property sector,
particularly on transaction volumes for the remainder of the
year,&#8221; Credit Suisse analysts led by Jinsong Du wrote in a
report yesterday. 
Falling Transactions 
Property transaction volumes will tumble by about 15
percent on average this year from 2009, the brokerage estimated,
keeping an earlier forecast that prices will slump 30 percent
from current levels. There are signs the government may &#8220;adopt
a more cautious stance on tightening&#8221; amid the European
sovereign-debt crisis, according to the report. 
China&#8217;s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has slid 21
percent this year, Asia&#8217;s worst performer. 
Goldman Sachs predicted volumes will fall 40 percent
between May and December from a year earlier, while home prices
will fall as much as 30 percent from current levels, according
to a note today. 
&#8220;A number of developers with funding gaps may face
refinancing issues if banks tighten credit to developers
further,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &#8220;We suggest
investors avoid such secondary real estate brokers due to their
high leverage to transaction volumes.&#8221; 
Guangzhou RF, Sino-Ocean 
Sales of new homes in Shanghai fell to a five-year low last
week as tightening measures took effect, property consultant
Shanghai UWin Real Estate Information Services Co. said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Sales from May 10 to May 16
fell 16 percent to 60,000 square meters from the week before,
the lowest level for the same period since 2005. 
Goldman Sachs cut its ratings for Guangzhou RF Properties
Co., Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., Sino-Ocean Land Holdings
Ltd. and Yanlord Land Group Ltd. to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; It
downgraded IFM Investments Ltd., Shanghai Forte Land Co. and
Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Holdings Co. to &#8220;sell&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; while upgrading China Resources Land Ltd. to
&#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;sell.&#8221; 
Credit Suisse lowered its recommendation for Greentown
China Holdings Ltd. to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
downgraded Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. and Hopson
Development Holdings Ltd. to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
Standard Chartered Bank also downgraded Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. and Sino Land Co. today to &#8220;in-line&#8221; from
&#8220;outperform,&#8221; citing a &#8220;less visible outlook&#8221; for Hong
Kong&#8217;s residential prices, according to an e-mailed note by
analyst John Chan. 
Guangzhou RF, the largest developer in the southern
Chinese city, fell 1.9 percent in Hong Kong trading, pacing a
retreat among property stocks. Shimao declined 1.2 percent while
Sino-Ocean Land lost 2.3 percent. Greentown China fell 2.2
percent while Hopson dropped 2.3 percent. Evergrande, China&#8217;s
second-biggest developer by first-quarter sales, tumbled 6.6
percent.

Pfizer Inc. and Celldex Therapeutics
Inc.&#8217;s said 70 percent of patients getting their experimental
brain tumor vaccine were alive without their cancer worsening
about eight months after diagnosis, a study found. 
Cancer typically progresses in about 50 percent of patients
during that time period, said Tom Davis, Celldex&#8217;s chief medical
officer. The finding, involving 40 patients, is from an interim
analysis of a study reported today by the American Society for
Clinical Oncology. The full results will be presented June 5 at
the group&#8217;s annual meeting in Chicago. 
New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
licensed rights to the drug last year from Needham,
Massachusetts-based Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus
royalties. If approved for brain cancer, the vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, said Joseph Pantginis, an analyst with Roth Capital
Partners LLC. 
Some investors may be disappointed because previous,
smaller studies appeared to show a greater benefit with about 90
percent of patients alive without their cancer worsening after
the treatment, called CDX-110, Pantginis said. That may be a
misinterpretation of the data because the studies aren&#8217;t
&#8220;apples-to-apples&#8221; comparisons, he said. 
Celldex fell 8.9 percent to $6.99 at 7:06 p.m. New York
time in extended trading after the close of the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Pfizer fell 13 cents to $15.10 in extended New York
trading. 
More Data Needed 
Further data on the vaccine&#8217;s survival benefit will be
needed to draw definitive conclusions on the treatment, said
Pantginis, who has a &#8216;buy&#8217; rating on Celldex shares. 
&#8220;There might be some disappointment out there because you
have erosion to the progression rate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is still
a positive progression number, but the data are immature.&#8221; 
The treatment is designed to ramp up the body&#8217;s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well, though none of
those indications are in human testing, Celldex said. 
The drug is in the second of three stages of testing
required to get U.S. regulatory approval. Pfizer hasn&#8217;t
announced plans to start final-stage testing. The next step
likely will be a placebo-controlled study looking at about 200
patients worldwide, Davis said. 
In the research, newly diagnosed patients received
injections of CDX-110 along with radiation therapy and Merck 
Co.&#8217;s Temodar until their tumor progressed. All patients
received the experimental treatment, rather than giving the
medicine to half of the participants while the other half
received placebos. 
Final results from 65 patients enrolled in the trial should
be available by year&#8217;s end, Davis said.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall operator, finished restructuring its
$15 billion secured-debt load, clearing an obstacle from its
path out of bankruptcy. 
Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan today approved
a restructuring agreement on a $95 million loan tied to a
Louisiana mall. It&#8217;s the last of the Chicago company&#8217;s secured
debt that needed to be restructured in bankruptcy, Anup Sathy, a
lawyer for General Growth, said in court. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to report, your honor, that our last loan is
done,&#8221; Sathy, an attorney with law firm Kirkland  Ellis, told
the judge. 
Today&#8217;s ruling by Gropper marks a milestone in General
Growth&#8217;s bankruptcy case. The mall operator has spent months
obtaining court approvals for restructuring deals on its secured
debt. 
Gropper said he was &#8220;delighted&#8221; that General Growth and
creditors reached a deal. A unit of Citigroup Inc. represents
holders of the loan, according to court documents. 
&#8220;I think everyone has benefited from the restructurings of
all the loans,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;The company is now on an
entirely different economic footing than when the case
started.&#8221; 
Extended Maturity 
General Growth reached agreements with lenders on a total
of 108 loans worth $15 billion, Sathy said. The debt is tied to
144 properties. The deal approved today, on the Oakwood Center
mall in Gretna, Louisiana, extends the maturity of the loan to
June 1, 2014, according to court papers. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
With agreements on its secured debt in place, General
Growth can now turn its attention to the final phase of its
reorganization: cementing an agreement for new financing
commitments that will fund the company&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy
protection. 
Earlier this month, the company won court approval to move
forward with an investment proposal from Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management LLC, and Pershing
Square Capital Management LP. They have agreed to invest $6.5
billion into the company, subject to higher bids from other
investors. The company plans to seek court approval of the
financing commitments in September, according to court
documents. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Chevron Corp., the energy producer
fighting lawsuits over drilling in Ecuador, must wait until
May 31 before proceeding with a subpoena seeking outtakes from a
movie about oil exploration, a judge ruled. 
Chevron won a court ruling May 6 ordering filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the
San Ramon, California-based company&#8217;s drilling in Ecuador. The
company argued that footage shot for &#8220;Crude: The Real Price of
Oil&#8221; may be relevant in a lawsuit brought by Ecuadorians, in
Chevron&#8217;s arbitration against Ecuador, and in criminal
proceedings in the South American country. 
A Chevron subpoena required Berlinger to surrender his
outtakes by tomorrow. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New
York today granted a 10-day postponement so that Berlinger may
appeal the judge&#8217;s May 6 ruling to the Court of Appeals in New
York. 
Berlinger&#8217;s lawyer, Maura Wogan, argued yesterday that
Kaplan&#8217;s earlier ruling will compromise the rights of other
documentary makers not to disclose unpublished material. 
Also today, lawyers for Berlinger filed an appeal of
Kaplan&#8217;s May 6 order.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s contract
to serve as financial adviser to New York&#8217;s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority won&#8217;t be renewed, according to a person
familiar with the matter. 
The decision to drop Goldman wasn&#8217;t related to a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the firm last
month, accusing it of misleading investors in a mortgage-linked
security, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the decision wasn&#8217;t public. The agency, which carries
8.5 million passengers a day, went through its normal process of
requesting proposals and found a better deal, said the person,
declining to be more specific. 
The advisory assignment with the MTA, one of the biggest
issuers of U.S. municipal debt, is among the market&#8217;s most
lucrative. The MTA, the largest mass-transit system in the U.S.,
plans to sell about $9 billion in bonds for capital projects in
the four years through 2013. 
Goldman became the MTA&#8217;s financial adviser in 2000, and its
contract was renewed in 2004. The firm earned about $21 million
advising the agency on bond issues, based on its fee of 65 cents
per each $1,000 unit sold since early 2002. The agency has
issued more than $31 billion in debt since March 2002, according
to audited financial statements. 
The MTA&#8217;s finance committee will recommend the board change
advisers on May 24, the person said. 
The MTA&#8217;s decision not to renew Goldman&#8217;s contract was
reported earlier by the New York Post and New York Times. 
Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the MTA, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
mall operator reorganizing in bankruptcy, clashed with lenders
on a $400 million loan over whether the company must disclose
now any plan to convert the debt to equity. 
General Growth said in court papers filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the lenders are improperly
demanding to be told if the loan will be converted as part of
the company&#8217;s plan to restructure its debt. 
The Chicago-based mall owner said the request constitutes
&#8220;an attempt to extinguish General Growth&#8217;s bargained-for
contractual rights&#8221; under the loan, which allows the company to
convert some or all of the debt to common stock when it exits
bankruptcy. 
David Feldman, an attorney for Law Debenture Trust Co. of
New York, which represents the lenders, declined to comment. 
In a court filing today, Law Debenture said General
Growth&#8217;s obligation to provide notice was triggered when the
company won approval earlier this month for new financing
commitments from a group of investors. General Growth loses the
option to convert the debt if it doesn&#8217;t provide notice within
one day, the Law Debenture said. 
The lenders specifically negotiated the right to know
whether they will be repaid in cash or stock, Law Debenture said
in its court filing. The lenders will incur &#8220;significant
risks&#8221; if they don&#8217;t know for certain how their debt will be
treated, it said. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper is scheduled to hold a
May 27 hearing on the dispute. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt

Johnson Controls Inc.&#8217;s unsolicited
$1.25 billion offer for bankrupt Visteon Corp.&#8217;s interiors and
electronics businesses may delay the company&#8217;s emergence from
creditor protection, an analyst said. 
Visteon said today in a statement that Johnson Controls,
the largest publicly traded U.S. auto-parts maker, is a
competitor and stands to benefit from introducing &#8220;delay and
complexity&#8221; into its reorganization. The cash offer for the
former Ford Motor Co. unit was made yesterday in a letter,
Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said in a separate statement. 
&#8220;This creates competition for these assets in the court,&#8221;
David Leiker, an analyst with Robert W. Baird, said in e-mailed
comments today. &#8220;At the end of the day, the creditors want to
maximize how much they get from the assets.&#8221; 
Johnson Controls&#8217; offer lacks &#8220;important information and
remains highly conditional and vaguely defined,&#8221; Visteon said.
The two companies have had &#8220;extensive and difficult
experiences&#8221; in prior transactions, Visteon said. 
&#8220;Although Visteon anticipates further dialogue with
Johnson Controls, the company will continue on its path toward
emerging from Chapter 11,&#8221; Visteon said. 
Johnson Controls rose 32 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $28 at
3:09 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 48 percent in the past year. 
Visteon is proposing to give 95 percent of its equity to
company bondholders in return for a $1.25 billion investment.
The arrangement would cancel Visteon&#8217;s current stock, the
company said May 7. 
Bondholder Investment 
Visteon is scheduled to ask the judge overseeing its
bankruptcy to approve the bondholders&#8217; investment on May 24.
That deal is opposed by shareholders, who say Visteon is solvent
enough to pay its debts and return the company to them. 
The company&#8217;s secured lenders also oppose the plan, saying
it would require Visteon to pay about $100 million in
unnecessary fees. 
The combination of the interior and electronics business of
both companies may mean revenue in China exceeding $7 billion,
Johnson Controls said. 
&#8220;Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics businesses would be
an excellent strategic fit with our Automotive Experience
business,&#8221; Johnson Controls Chief Executive Officer Stephen A. Roell said in the statement. &#8220;This acquisition would
significantly expand our automotive interior technologies and
capabilities.&#8221; 
China Presence 
The purchase would give Johnson Controls a larger presence
in China and more offerings in vehicle audio, Leiker wrote in a
report today. Johnson Controls reported $28.5 billion in revenue
with a net loss of $338 million in the fiscal year that ended in
September. About $12 billion of the sales came from its
automotive unit. 
Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics business generated
revenue of $4.1 billion in 2009 and an estimated $230 million in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
said Leiker, who rates Johnson Controls shares &#8220;buy.&#8221; 
The offer represents less than five times the Visteon
businesses&#8217; estimated 2010 Ebitda, he said. 
Johnson Controls said it has approached Van Buren Township,
Michigan-based Visteon twice before about the businesses.
Johnson Controls hired Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz and
JPMorgan Securities to assist in a transaction. 
Visteon, spun off from Ford in 2000, filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, listing assets of $4.58 billion and debt of $5.32
billion in Chapter 11 documents. 
Visteon&#8217;s 7 percent bonds due in 2014 were unchanged today
at 106 cents on the dollar after falling 6.2 percent yesterday,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Johnson Controls Inc., the largest
publicly traded U.S. auto-parts maker, made an unsolicited offer
of $1.25 billion in cash for bankrupt rival Visteon Corp.&#8217;s
interiors and electronics businesses. 
Johnson Controls made the offer yesterday in a letter to
the former Ford Motor Co. unit, the Milwaukee-based parts
company said today in a statement. The combination of the
interior and electronics business of both companies may mean
revenue in China exceeding $7 billion, Johnson Controls said. 
&#8220;We believe that Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics
businesses would be an excellent strategic fit with our
Automotive Experience business,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Stephen A. Roell said in the statement. &#8220;This acquisition would
significantly expand our automotive interior technologies and

The purchase would give JCI a larger presence in China and
more offerings in vehicle audio, David Leiker, an analyst with
Robert W. Baird, wrote in a report today. Johnson Controls

$338 million in the fiscal year that ended in September. About
$12 billion of the sales came from its automotive unit. 
Visteon&#8217;s interiors and electronics business generated
revenue of $4.1 billion in 2009 and an estimated $230 million in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
said Leiker, who rates Johnson Controls a buy. 
Visteon Responds 
The offer lacks &#8220;important information and remains highly
conditional and vaguely defined,&#8221; Visteon said in a statement
today on PR Newswire. Visteon has had &#8220;extensive and difficult
experiences with Johnson Controls in prior transactions,&#8221; the
company said in the statement. 
&#8220;Although Visteon anticipates further dialogue with
Johnson Controls, the company will continue on its path toward
emerging from Chapter 11,&#8221; Visteon said. 
Visteon is proposing to give 95 percent of its equity to
company bondholders in return for a $1.25 billion investment.
The arrangement would cancel Visteon&#8217;s current stock, the
company said May 7. 
Visteon is scheduled to ask the judge overseeing the
company&#8217;s bankruptcy on May 24 to approve the equity investment
by bondholders. That deal is opposed by shareholders, who say
Visteon is solvent enough to pay off all its debts and return
the company to them. 
The company&#8217;s secured lenders also oppose the bondholder
investment, saying it would require Visteon to pay about
$100 million in unnecessary fees. 
Past Offers 
Johnson Controls said it has approached Van Buren Township,
Michigan-based Visteon twice before about the businesses.
Johnson Controls hired Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz and
JPMorgan Securities to assist in a transaction. 
Visteon, spun off from Ford in 2000, filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, listing assets of $4.58 billion and debt of
$5.32 billion in Chapter 11 documents. 
Johnson Controls rose 88 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $28.56
at 12:38 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 48 percent in the past year. 
Visteon&#8217;s 7 percent bonds due in 2014 were unchanged today
at 106 cents on the dollar after falling 6.2 percent yesterday,

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a southern
Appalachia coal producer, led miners higher on speculation a
sell-off prompted by the European debt crisis was overdone. 
Walter climbed $5.81, or 8.8 percent, to $71.91 as of 11:47

Co., the sixth-biggest U.S. coal producer, jumped $2.07, or 6.9

Each of the coal companies has fallen at least 17 percent

Analysts predict Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. will pay $1 billion or more to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission fraud suit that triggered a 26 percent drop
in the firm&#8217;s stock. Extracting such a record-setting penalty
may be easier said than done. 
When it comes to presenting a settlement for court
approval, the SEC will have to &#8220;have a good explanation and
justification for the number,&#8221; said Donald Langevoort, a former
SEC attorney who teaches securities law at Georgetown University
in Washington. 
Looming over negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street&#8217;s
most profitable investment bank is a reminder from Judge Jed Rakoff that courts can reject settlements -- even when the SEC&#8217;s
adversary is willing and able to pay. Rakoff, a U.S. district
court judge in Manhattan, refused to sign off on a $33 million
accord with Bank of America Corp. in September, noting that the
SEC didn&#8217;t adequately explain how it came up with the dollar
amount. 
A sanction in the range of $1 billion would be hard to
support based on the allegations in the Goldman Sachs complaint,
according to James Coffman, a former SEC enforcement official
who retired in 2007. That figure would be more than double what
any Wall Street firm has agreed to pay as part of a civil
settlement with authorities. 
Under one formula outlined in securities laws, the SEC
could impose a maximum $15 million penalty on the bank to
resolve fraud allegations that it misled buyers of mortgage-
backed investments. That formula has been routinely ignored in
enforcement cases and the SEC will seek more from a firm
depicted as an icon of Wall Street greed at congressional
hearings, Coffman said. 
$1 Billion &#8216;Goalpost&#8217; 
The SEC&#8217;s April 16 complaint accused Goldman Sachs of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation linked
to home loans. The firm concealed the fact that Paulson  Co., a
New York-based hedge fund, picked components of the CDO and bet
it would collapse, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, which
underwrote and marketed the product in 2007, collected about $15
million in fees and Paulson reaped a $1 billion profit. The
remaining investors lost more than $1 billion, according to the
complaint. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has denied wrongdoing. Paulson hasn&#8217;t been
accused of any impropriety and the firm&#8217;s founder, John Paulson,
has said it didn&#8217;t market the transaction or have authority to
select securities in the CDO. 
The $1 billion loss for investors has become the minimum
&#8220;goalpost&#8221; that the public expects the SEC to reach, according
to James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in
Durham, North Carolina. 
&#8216;Whatever it Takes&#8217; 
A settlement would cost the firm &#8220;at least $1 billion, if
not more, which they can easily pay,&#8221; Matt McCormick, an
analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about
$2.8 billion, said in an April 30 Bloomberg Television
interview. The firm &#8220;will do whatever it takes to get this
away, or at least they should.&#8221; 
As the agency&#8217;s first effort to punish a bank for creating
and selling securities tied to subprime mortgages, the Goldman
Sachs case will be dissected by the industry, in Congress and in
the media, Coffman said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of attention paid to this on Capitol
Hill and in the press,&#8221; said Coffman, who predicts Goldman
Sachs will pay about $100 million. The SEC will consider &#8220;how
much public interest there is in sending a strong message and
coming up with a settlement that shows the cops are on the
beat.&#8221; 
SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment. 
Softening Its Tone 
Public statements from Goldman Sachs have softened in the
month since the SEC announced its case as the firm&#8217;s image and
stock price have taken a beating. 
In an April 16 press release, Goldman Sachs called the suit
&#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; and pledged to &#8220;vigorously&#8221; defend
its reputation. Four days later, co-General Counsel Greg Palm
broached the idea of resolving the case, saying on a conference
call with investors that &#8220;you always have the option&#8221; of
settling if both sides forge an agreement. 
In the days following an April 27 Senate hearing where
Goldman Sachs managers were accused of putting the firm&#8217;s
interest ahead of clients, two executives at the firm who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the company was eager to settle
the SEC case in an attempt to contain the reputational damage. 
Ramifications of Accord 
The subject of how much money the firm may pay hasn&#8217;t been
raised during early discussions between the SEC and Goldman 
Sachs, according to a person briefed on the matter, speaking
anonymously because the talks were private. 
Negotiations are more likely to stall over the way the SEC
ultimately describes the firm&#8217;s conduct, rather than the size 
of any fine, said two people familiar with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
thinking. Goldman would resist agreeing to a settlement that
includes an allegation of fraud, because doing so could hurt
the firm&#8217;s business, they said. 
Settling a fraud case would restrict Goldman Sachs and its
employees from managing investment companies registered with the
SEC, unless the bank got an exemption from the agency. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset management unit currently oversees
mutual funds, money-market funds and bond funds, according to
its website. Goldman Sachs would also risk losing its ability to
raise money quickly through securities sales without meeting
certain regulatory burdens. 
The SEC and New York-based Goldman Sachs will have to
litigate if they can&#8217;t agree on an accord. 
&#8216;Pecuniary Gain&#8217; 
The SEC suit cites the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both laws limit their most
severe fines to either $650,000 per violation or the &#8220;pecuniary
gain&#8221; reaped by the defendant. 
SEC investigators don&#8217;t have to follow those limitations if
they can persuade companies to pay more, a majority of agency
commissioners vote to approve the settlement and a judge signs
off on the accord, said former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s basically what the two sides hammer out,&#8221; he said. 
Goldman Sachs argues the $15 million in commissions it
received for putting the CDO together were offset by more than
$90 million the firm lost on its own stake in the transaction. 
ABN Amro Bank NV lost more than $840 million and
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost
most of its $150 million investment, according to the SEC. 
The SEC typically requires defendants in a settlement to
pay a fine and return ill-gotten profits to victims. 
Citigroup&#8217;s 2003 Settlement 
Citigroup Inc. paid $400 million in 2003 to settle SEC and
state allegations that its analysts hyped telecommunications
stocks that its researchers privately thought were
underperformers. 
The SEC said in its complaint that Citigroup made $790
million in revenue from underwriting telecom securities from
1999 through 2001, relying on analysts to &#8220;generate substantial
profits&#8221; for the company&#8217;s investment bankers. 
Citigroup agreed to a $150 million fine, returned $150
million of ill-gotten gains, and paid $100 million to provide
clients with independent research and investor education. 
Bank of America, in the second-biggest agreement between
the SEC and a bank in the past decade, paid $375 million in 2004
to settle claims the company didn&#8217;t disclose that some of its
mutual funds allowed clients to make trades detrimental to other
investors. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America paid a $125
million fine and $250 million in disgorgement. Its fine was 10
times the $12.5 million in revenue the SEC said it received from
one of the hedge funds making improper trades. 
Prudential&#8217;s Choice 
Prudential Securities Inc. agreed in a 1993 settlement
with the SEC and state regulators to pay $371 million in
restitution and fines, and to fully compensate all investors who
lost money in oil, gas and real estate partnerships it sold
without disclosing the risks. Over time the company paid more
than $1 billion to resolve claims dating back to the 1980s. 
Goldman Sachs remains the most profitable firm in Wall
Street history. It earned $13.4 billion in 2009 and an
additional $3.5 billion in the first three months of 2010. 
&#8220;Money hurts but limitations on business can hurt in a lot
more ways and that can be the hurt that keeps on giving,&#8221;
Coffman said.

Coda Automotive, which makes
batteries in China for its electric cars, plans to open a
factory in Ohio as a hedge against a possible rise in the yuan,
Senior Vice President Mark Atkeson said. 
Coda of Santa Monica, California, paired with Tianjin
Lishen Battery Co., majority owned by Chinese energy producer
Cnooc Ltd., to make batteries in Tianjin. Coda also gets auto
parts from a plant in northern China, to be assembled in
California for sale in the U.S. later this year. 
&#8220;We feel in the long-run there is a need for a global
manufacturing base,&#8221; Atkeson told reporters on May 22. One
reason is that &#8220;the renminbi will go up,&#8221; he said, using
another name for the Chinese currency. That would increase the
costs of goods exported to the U.S., he said 
The yuan&#8217;s value has been fixed to about 6.83 to one U.S.
dollar for almost two years, and China is being pressed by
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to let the value of the
currency appreciate to boost domestic demand and control
inflation. Geithner met with Chinese officials in Beijing
yesterday as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. 
Closely held Coda, which has former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson on its advisory board, aims to sell 14,000
electric cars by the end of next year, Atkeson said in an e-mail
exchange on May 23.

Microsoft Corp. is less optimistic
about China as a market than India or Indonesia because of the
country&#8217;s lack of progress in stamping out software piracy,
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. 
&#8220;India is not perfect but the intellectual property
protection in India is far, far better than it would be in
China,&#8221; the head of the world&#8217;s largest software maker said in
an interview in Hanoi, Vietnam, yesterday. &#8220;China is a less
interesting market to us than India, than Indonesia.&#8221; 
Ballmer&#8217;s concerns underscore growing dismay among U.S.
companies toward operating in the world&#8217;s third-largest economy.
Google Inc. in March moved its Chinese service out of the
mainland to avoid censorship rules, and the American Chamber of
Commerce in Beijing said last month its members face an
increasingly difficult regulatory environment. 
China has implemented more than 1,000 measures related to
the protection of intellectual property and the government will
continue such efforts, said Chen Rongkai, a media officer at the
nation&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s effort at strengthening protection of
intellectual property is universally recognized,&#8221; Chen said. 
Lack of progress in protecting intellectual property has
led China, which may overtake the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest
personal-computer market in a year, to generate less revenue for
Microsoft than India and South Korea, Ballmer said. China&#8217;s
gross domestic product is twice the two economies combined.

Morgan Stanley hired Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s David Heaton, an investment banker to fund managers
including Legg Mason Inc., said a person with direct knowledge
of the matter. 
Heaton, 43, will join in August and run investment banking
for asset-management companies, said the person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because Heaton hasn&#8217;t joined the firm
yet. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. 
Heaton has worked on some of the biggest asset-management
deals, helping Merrill Lynch  Co. sell its investment
management unit to BlackRock Inc. in 2006 and helping Legg
Mason, the Baltimore-based money manager, raise capital from
investors including KKR  Co. in 2008. 
Heaton will be offering merger and financing advice to fund
management companies, many of whom rely on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
18,000-strong retail brokerage venture to distribute their
investment products. Before joining Deutsche Bank, Heaton spent
almost two decades at Merrill Lynch, formerly the largest retail
brokerage. 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney eclipsed Merrill Lynch last
year when it was created as a joint venture of Morgan Stanley
and Citigroup Inc. 
Heaton was part of a group of 12 Merrill Lynch bankers who
defected to the German bank last year after Merrill Lynch was
sold to Bank of America Corp. New York-based Merrill Lynch filed
a lawsuit over their departures that was later resolved with a

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy Sterling Commerce for $1.4 billion in cash, gaining software
that helps businesses conduct transactions. 
IBM will buy Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling from ATT Inc.,
the biggest U.S. phone carrier, according to a statement from
the companies today. Its software helps businesses share
information and transfer files to other companies. 
IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano plans to spend
$20 billion on takeovers in the next five years as he bolsters
the software business, IBM&#8217;s most profitable. Sterling&#8217;s
programs allow companies to manage and create their networks on
external servers, a business known as cloud computing -- which
IBM expects to reach $3 billion by 2015. 
&#8220;Plugging this gap was crucial for IBM,&#8221; said Ken
Vollmer, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Syracuse, New
York. &#8220;IBM will be able to take the technology and meld it
together with theirs.&#8221; 
The transaction will likely close in the second half of
2010, the companies said. ATT probably will record a pretax
gain of $750 million on the deal once it&#8217;s completed. About
2,500 Sterling employees will join IBM&#8217;s software division.

General Electric Co., the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, won its first order for a
U.S. offshore project, to be built in Lake Erie near Cleveland. 
GE will supply five direct-drive turbines that can generate
as much as 4 megawatts each in a project with the Lake Erie
Energy Development Corp. that they expect to complete in 2012,
the company said today in a statement. GE will also provide
maintenance services. 
&#8220;Offshore wind has the potential to create thousands of
new jobs in Ohio and become a major source of economic growth,&#8221;
Victor Abate, who runs GE&#8217;s renewable energy businesses, said in
the statement. 
GE will work with Lake Erie Energy to identify additional
locations for offshore wind projects, with the goal of
developing 1,000 megawatts by 2020, he said. 
Ohio Governor Ted Strickland said the project will help
reduce the state&#8217;s reliance on generating electricity from coal.
The state gets about 90 percent of its power from burning the
fossil fuel, which contributes the largest single man-made
source of greenhouse gases. 
Governor Praises Move 
&#8220;There are associated costs with coal that don&#8217;t make it
into the cost of electricity,&#8221; Strickland said today in a media
briefing at a wind energy conference in Dallas. &#8220;We want to use
this project to find ways to produce wind power cheaper.&#8221; 
GE bolstered its access to offshore-turbine technology last
year with its purchase of the ScanWind unit of Morphic
Technologies AB in Sweden for 130 million kronor ($18 million).
ScanWind&#8217;s gearless conversion box is designed to cut
maintenance costs, helping GE compete with offshore leader
Siemens AG. 
The U.K., the nation with the most offshore wind capacity,
has about 8 gigawatts (8,000 megawatts) operating or planned and
is targeting an additional 25 gigawatts, its government said in
June. Growth will also be driven as designs improve for large
offshore turbines, which are costlier and more difficult to
repair than land-based versions, Abate said. 
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE slipped 23 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $16.19 a share as of 1:22 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 7.1 percent
this year.

Walt Disney Co. ended negotiations to
sell its Miramax film studio to Los Angeles billionaire Ron Burkle, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, resumed talks
with Los Angeles investors Alec and Tom Gores, who had earlier
made an offer, said a third person. The people asked not to be
identified because the talks aren&#8217;t public. 
Burkle remains interested, one of the people said. He is
working with Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax founders who
sold the studio to Disney in 1993. The group is talking with the
board of the Weinstein Co. to resolve legal issues that caused
delays, the person said. If a settlement is reached, a deal
could be revived, two people said. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Disney ended
talks. Burkle had offered $625 million, two of the people said.
The Weinstein brothers, who weren&#8217;t expected to hold an equity
stake, were to receive pay and performance bonuses for
overseeing the studio and library. 
Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Weinstein Co., had no immediate comment.
Burkle didn&#8217;t respond to a request for an interview. 
Weinstein Co. investor Mark Cuban said on April 21 that he
may try to stop the Weinstein brothers from joining Burkle&#8217;s
bid. The Cuban dispute involves the 2009 release &#8220;The Road,&#8221;
Dani Weinstein said at the time. The film, produced for $25
million, took in $23.9 million in worldwide ticket sales,
according to researcher Box Office Mojo. 
Disney fell 55 cents to $31.93 at 2:16 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had climbed less
than 1 percent this year before today.

other investors, the people said. 
Alliance  Leicester, a U.K. unit of Banco Santander SA,
Spain&#8217;s largest bank, will issue the notes in dollars, pounds

International Business Machines Corp.
and trade groups for major U.S. companies are pressing Congress
to defeat a jobs bill containing billions of dollars in taxes on
their global operations. 
The effort is led in part by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and an alliance of companies including IBM, Microsoft Corp. and
General Electric Co. They are targeting a measure that extends
aid to unemployed workers, promotes bonds for infrastructure
projects and renews more than three-dozen business tax breaks,
including a credit for experimental research that many of the
companies support. 
In a letter to lawmakers yesterday, Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, told
lawmakers it &#8220;strongly opposes&#8221; the legislation and would
rather do without the research credit than face new taxes on
overseas profits. 
&#8220;Although our company has been a long-time supporter of
the RD tax credit that has enjoyed bipartisan support in
Congress over many years, the pending legislation would impose
significant new tax increases that will completely overwhelm any
positive economic effect&#8221; of the tax credit, wrote Christopher Padilla, vice president of governmental programs for IBM. 
No &#8216;Meaningful Benefit&#8217; 
IBM reduced its effective tax rate by 9 percentage points
in 2009 because it was able to defer U.S. taxes on money earned
in lower-tax countries, according to filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The value of its research tax credits
wasn&#8217;t specified. IBM, in a June 2008 policy document, said it
has been &#8220;unable to derive meaningful benefit&#8221; from the
research credit for &#8220;many years.&#8221; 
Opposition from major U.S.-based multinational corporations
injects a new lobbying front into an effort to defeat the bill,
which has been opposed most prominently by private-equity firms
such as New York-based Blackstone Group LP and Washington-based
Carlyle Group, the National Venture Capital Association and the
Real Estate Roundtable. 
Those groups are trying to block a proposed tax increase on
carried interest, the share of profits that fund executives earn
as part of their compensation. Carried interest is taxed at the
lower capital-gains rate when it involves long-term gains. That
rate is currently 15 percent and is scheduled to rise to 20
percent in 2011. 
Ordinary Rates 
The bill would begin taxing half of carried interest at
ordinary rates as high as 35 percent this year. By 2013, three-
quarters of carried interest would be subject to ordinary rates,
which are scheduled to be more than 40 percent. 
IBM and the business groups are protesting eight provisions
in the bill projected to raise about $14.5 billion by making it
harder for U.S.-based companies to claim credits for taxes they
pay to other governments. The tax credits are intended to
prevent double taxation and can only be claimed when those
foreign profits are repatriated to the U.S. 
U.S. lawmakers, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, say companies are
using a variety of techniques to reduce their U.S. tax bills
without ever bringing their profits to the country. 
Some &#8220;have used techniques to maximize the amount of money
they leave overseas at the same time they&#8217;re claiming&#8221; the
foreign tax credit &#8220;to avoid U.S. taxes on other income
sources,&#8221; Levin told reporters on a conference call today. He
called the technique a &#8220;manipulation of the tax code&#8221; that is
&#8220;tilting the playing field in favor of investment overseas.&#8221; 
Government Spending 
The bill also faces some opposition in the Senate because
it would add to the deficit. It would spend $63 billion to
postpone cuts in Medicare fees to doctors, $55 billion to extend
unemployment benefits and $24 billion to aid state governments.
Lawyers, oil companies and businesses that use offshore tax
havens would see their taxes go up. 
The House is scheduled to debate the broader tax measure
this week, and the Senate is poised to act too. Lawmakers are
under pressure to adopt the bill because the unemployment aid
expires May 31. 
Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, on
the conference call with Levin, wouldn&#8217;t say how soon the bill
will come to the floor. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident that we will have the
votes&#8221; to pass it, he said. 
Opposition to international tax provisions are complicating
the effort to pass more than three-dozen tax breaks that have
been popular with lawmakers in the past, even as they were
criticized for bestowing narrow benefits on special interests
including race track owners, makers of toy bows and arrows,
restaurant operators, and tuna canners. 
Build America Bonds 
The package would also extend the Build America Bonds
program and renew a provision that benefits companies such as
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. that sell financial products in overseas markets. 
The tax breaks, which generally expired Dec. 31 and must be
renewed to be available this year, also include benefits for
individuals, such as a $250 deduction for teachers who buy their
own classroom supplies and a write-off for state and local sales
taxes that primarily benefits residents of states like Texas,
Alaska and Florida, which have no income taxes to deduct on
federal forms. 
&#8220;While the economy needs an extension of expiring
provisions, the chamber cannot support legislation which imposes
onerous, permanent tax increases to pay for the temporary
extension of these provisions,&#8221; wrote Bruce Josten, executive
vice president of government affairs for the Chamber of
Commerce. 
&#8216;Principles of Fairness&#8217; 
A separate coalition, Promote America&#8217;s Competitive Edge,
which counts GE; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft; Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., and Cincinnati-based Procter 
Gamble Co. among its members, also protested the bill, saying
the international tax changes &#8220;run contrary to the principles
of fairness and due process.&#8221; 
The National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington
trade group, today urged lawmakers to strip the international
tax provisions from the bill. It said the way companies use the
foreign tax credit has been &#8220;mischaracterized as loopholes.&#8221; 
&#8220;NAM strongly urges policymakers to advance legislation
that includes much-needed tax relief without anti-growth, anti-
competitiveness revenue raisers,&#8221; the group wrote to House
members.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Achintya Mangla and Aloke Gupte back from Merrill Lynch  Co., about a
month after they departed for the U.S. rival, said two people
with knowledge of the matter. 
Mangla will become co-head of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia outside Japan and Australia
together with Arjun Khullar, one of the people said, declining
to be identified as no public announcement has been made. Gupte
will run convertible bond underwriting for the Asia-Pacific
region, the position Mangla previously held, the person said. 
Investment banks have stepped up hiring in Asia in the past
year as the region led the global economy out of a recession.
Investment-banking fees in Asia jumped 68 percent in the first
four months from a year earlier to a record $5.6 billion,
according to New York-based research firm Freeman  Co. 
Mangla and Khullar will report to Doug Howland and Kester Ng, who were promoted to joint heads of equity capital and
derivatives markets for Asia-Pacific, the person said. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Marie Cheung
declined to comment, as did Rob Stewart of Merrill Lynch, the
investment-banking division of Bank of America Corp. Mangla and
Gupte weren&#8217;t available, said a person who answered the phone at
JPMorgan&#8217;s Hong Kong offices. 
Merrill Lynch hired Mangla in late April to run its
convertible bond underwriting business in the Asia-Pacific
outside Japan, people with knowledge of the matter said at the
time. Gupte joined Merrill Lynch at the same time. Both bankers
were on so-called gardening leave and hadn&#8217;t yet started work at
Merrill Lynch when JPMorgan rehired them, one person said. They
will be based in Hong Kong.

Johnson Controls Inc. said it may be

bankrupt Visteon Corp.&#8217;s interiors and electronics businesses as
it completes its due diligence. 
&#8220;To the extent that we are able to find additional value
through the due diligence process, we may be able to increase
our price for the two businesses,&#8221; JCI Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Roell said in a May 20 letter to Visteon CEO Don Stebbins that was released yesterday in a regulatory filing. 
Due diligence could be completed as quickly as 30 days,
Roell said, without giving an amount by which the bid might be
increased. The cash offer for the former Ford Motor Co. unit was
made in a May 20 letter, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said
in a separate statement last week. It didn&#8217;t release the letter
at that time. 
Visteon said May 21 in a statement that Johnson Controls,
the largest publicly traded U.S. auto-parts maker, is a
competitor and stands to benefit from introducing &#8220;delay and
complexity&#8221; into its reorganization. 
Jacqueline Strayer, a JCI spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call seeking comment. 
Johnson Controls fell 51 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $27.68
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 48 percent in the past year. 
Visteon, spun off from Ford in 2000, filed for bankruptcy
in May 2009, listing assets of $4.58 billion and debt of
$5.32 billion in Chapter 11 documents.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, sold $1.25 billion of 10-year
senior notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The 6 percent fixed-rate debt priced to yield 280 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage points. 
The sale came as companies sold $6 billion in debt today,
the most in five weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Issuance of corporate bonds has fallen 59 percent this month
from April amid growing concerns that European countries will
struggle to manage their debts, slowing the global economic
recovery, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;Goldman is pretty good at timing the market when these
chances open up,&#8221; said Charles Sanford, who helps manage $129
billion at Babson Capital Management LLC in Springfield,
Massachusetts. &#8220;It was an opportunistic deal on Goldman&#8217;s
part.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs paid more to tap the corporate debt market
than it did two months ago, when it sold $750 million of 10-
year, 5.375 percent notes at a spread of 175 basis points on
March 19 in a reopening of an issue from earlier that month,
Bloomberg data show. It paid a 190 basis-point spread when it
sold $2 billion of the notes on March 1, the data show. 
Those notes traded at 95.862 cents on the dollar at 3:53
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
yields 5.94 percent, or 273.6 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Trace data show. On May 25, the bonds ended
trading at a 276.1 basis-point spread, the data show. 
&#8216;Buying Opportunity&#8217; 
&#8220;We think it&#8217;s a buying opportunity now,&#8221; said Michael Donelan, director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan
Labs Inc., who yesterday bought 10-year Goldman Sachs notes. 
Spreads on all investment-grade corporate bonds fell 2
basis points to 204 basis points, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Corporate Master Index. Bonds issued by
banks fell 7 basis points to 276 basis points. 
Investors have demanded higher yields from the world&#8217;s
biggest financial institutions than other corporate bond issuers
because of concern that Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis will
reduce lenders&#8217; creditworthiness and that regulatory efforts to
control risk taking will crimp their profits. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $1.5 billion of 10-year notes sold
on March 25 rose 0.409 cent on the dollar to 100.263 cents at
3:30 p.m. in New York, according to Trace data. The notes yield
4.915 percent, or 171.6 basis points more than benchmarks, Trace
data show. 
Companies selling bonds today included TransCanada
Pipelines Ltd., which offered $1.25 billion of 5- and 30-year
notes, and Discovery Communications Inc., which issued $3
billion of debt in a three-part offering, according to Bloomberg
data. Today&#8217;s total is the most since $12.3 billion on April 21,
Bloomberg data show.

The U.S. economy will expand up to 4
percent annually for a &#8220;couple of years&#8221; and then settle into
a predicted &#8220;new normal&#8221; of slow growth, according to Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
New York-based Kasman said that while he agrees with
Pacific Investment Management Co.&#8217;s new-normal concept, the
economy may be initially buoyant. Pimco Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed A. El-Erian has forecast the worst slump since the Great
Depression will be followed by an environment of below-average
economic expansion, increased regulation and lower consumption
amid higher unemployment. 
&#8220;We are buyers of the idea that there is a new normal in
terms of where unemployment rates are going to be, what the
supply side of the U.S. economy&#8217;s going to deliver,&#8221; Kasman
said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;Our
distinction is we can see a lot of reasons to be pessimistic
about structural performance here in medium-term trends and
still see a couple of years of pretty good growth, 3 to 4
percent.&#8221; 
Newport Beach, California-based El-Erian wrote in a
Bloomberg News column in February that the U.S. economy faces a
&#8220;protracted post-crisis resetting&#8221; as high unemployment
persists. 
Kasman, a former researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, correctly predicted January&#8217;s unexpectedly strong 5.7
percent gain in GDP. JPMorgan forecasts GDP growth for the
second and third quarters to be 4 percent, slowing to 3.5
percent in the fourth quarter and to 3.2 percent for 2011. 
&#8220;The new-normal thesis makes sense in terms of what&#8217;s
happening underneath the surface, but I don&#8217;t think you want to
apply it to GDP and production and labor income data in a world
in which there&#8217;s going to be a cyclical lift that carries us for
a while,&#8221; Kasman said.

One in six U.S. mobile-phone
customers has faced unexpected monthly fees, according to a
survey released by the Federal Communications Commission as part
of a drive to wrest clearer information from wireless carriers. 
Almost half of consumers subscribing to plans with fees for
dropping service before the end of a contract didn&#8217;t know the
amount they would be charged, the agency said today in an e-
mailed statement, citing the survey. 
&#8220;There is still more that can be done to help customers
navigate what is sometimes a confusing marketplace,&#8221; FCC
Chairman Julius Genachowski said in the statement. Consumers
would be helped by &#8220;simple and easy to understand&#8221; purchase
and billing procedures, he said. 
Verizon Wireless, ATT Inc. and other service providers may
face rules similar to those in Europe, where carriers must send
text messages to subscribers who are close to plan limits, the
FCC said May 11. The agency said it is talking with wireless
industry groups about steps to improve bills. 
&#8220;We really can&#8217;t say at this point whether this all will
result in a rulemaking or voluntary standards,&#8221; Joel Gurin,
chief of the FCC Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, said
on a conference call with reporters. 
Of the 30 million Americans who said they were surprised by
their bills, 88 percent weren&#8217;t contacted by their carriers when
charges increased, the agency said today. About 84 percent
weren&#8217;t contacted when they were about to exceed their allowed
minutes, text messages, or data downloads, the agency said. 
FCC &#8216;Micromanage&#8217; 
&#8220;It seems the commission is going to attempt to
micromanage what is an incredible array of choices for
consumers,&#8221; said Steve Largent, president of the Washington-
based CTIA - The Wireless Association, in an e-mailed statement. 
The wireless industry &#8220;does provide &#8216;simple and easy to
understand&#8217; plans for every type of American consumer,&#8221; Largent
said. 
&#8220;Only 36 percent&#8221; of mobile-phone customers who are
familiar with their bills said that they include &#8220;very clear&#8221;
information on early termination fees, the agency said. 
More than a third of people surprised by a bill said
charges jumped by at least $50, and 23 percent said the increase
was $100 or more, the FCC said. 
The telephone survey of 3,005 adults was conducted from
April 19 to May 2 by Abt/SRBI and Princeton Survey Research
Associates International, the FCC said. For responses based on
those with personal cell phones, or about 80 percent of
respondents, the margin of error was plus or minus two
percentage points, the agency said. 
ATT, Verizon 
ATT on May 21 said that beginning June 1, it will increase
early termination fees to $325 from $175 for users of the Apple
Inc. iPhone and other devices used for computing on the go. 
Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. and
U.K.-based Vodafone Group PLC, told the FCC Dec. 18 that
consumers are protected by &#8220;detailed disclosure practices&#8221;
about early termination fees, which doubled in November to $350
for advanced phones. 
Increases in charges for ending a service contract is &#8220;just
not an area we&#8217;re getting into, at least at this point,&#8221; Gurin
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re focused on clarity, disclosure, consumer
information.&#8221;

PTC India Financial Services Ltd., a
company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group
Ltd., is planning a share sale to tap growing investor interest
in the South Asian nation&#8217;s power projects, the chairman said. 
PFS, which invests in electricity generation plants and
assets, needs to raise as much as 10 billion rupees ($211
million) and may make an initial public offering by end
September, said Tantra Narayan Thakur, who is also chairman of
parent company PTC India Ltd. 
&#8220;Today is the best time to invest in the Indian power
market,&#8221; Thakur said in an interview in New Delhi. &#8220;More and
more people want electricity.&#8221; 
India plans to double its installed electricity capacity in
the next seven years to meet energy demand and reduce blackouts
in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. The federal
government has raised at least 102 billion rupees from selling
shares in three state-owned power-related companies since
January. 
PFS may sell a stake to a private equity investor before
the IPO, said Thakur. JM Financial Ltd., SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
and ICICI Securities Ltd. will advise the sale, he said. 
PTC, India&#8217;s largest power trader, has a 77 percent stake
in PFS and plans to retain a 51 percent holding after the sale,
Thakur said. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie currently hold 11.5
percent each, he said. 
Ashmore Fund 
The banks paid 16 rupees a share for their holdings in 2008,
he said. Macquarie spokesman Paul Scanlon said in an e-mail the
company had no comment. Deepa Jayaraman, a New Delhi-based
spokeswoman at IPAN Hill  Knowlton, which handles public
relations for Goldman Sachs, was unable to respond immediately
to an e-mail requesting comment. 
PTC India is setting up a $1 billion fund with the U.K.-
based Ashmore Group Plc to finance electricity generation
projects in India, he said. 
PTC and Ashmore aim to raise $500 million in the first
round by the end of September that will be invested in eight to
10 thermal and hydropower projects in the pipeline, he said. 
The fund plans to make minimum investments of $25 million
each, mostly in power projects and potentially in energy assets
such as gas import terminals and pipelines, Thakur said. 
PTC may spend up to 3 billion rupees to acquire coal assets
abroad as part of an effort to diversify into fuel sources,
Thakur said. The power trader raised $400 million by selling
shares to institutional investors in January 2008 and May 2009. 
The government sold stakes in Rural Electrification Corp.,
a state-owned lender for power projects, NTPC Ltd., the
country&#8217;s biggest power generator, and SJVN Ltd., operator of
India&#8217;s largest hydropower plant.

Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for the dollar&#8217;s value against the euro to $1.16 from $1.24 by
the end of the year after the Greek debt crisis &#8220;undermined&#8221;
the European Central Bank. 
The 16-nation currency touched a four-year low of $1.2144
on May 19 as Germany&#8217;s ban on some speculative trades against
bank and government credit quality added to concern Greece&#8217;s
funding crisis would spread through the region. The ECB had said
on May 10 it would start buying public- and private-sector debt
as part of a bid to halt the fiscal crisis and rescue the euro. 
&#8220;The initial fiscal problem in the periphery (Greece) has
now become a fiscal problem for core Europe,&#8221; Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
Stephen Hull in London wrote in a report today. &#8220;More
importantly for the euro, it has also undermined the credibility
of the ECB.&#8221; 
The shared currency will reach a low around $1.12 in the
first quarter of 2011 before recovering later in the year, the
research note said. It will probably rise against the pound,
buying 90 pence by the end of the year from 84.77 pence today,
Morgan Stanley predicted. The U.K. currency will probably fall
to $1.29 in December from $1.4582 today. 
&#8220;We see the dollar being well supported for the remainder
of 2010,&#8221; Hull wrote in the report. &#8220;U.S. growth is still
surprising on the upside.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for the dollar versus the
yen, citing data showing a larger flow of funds into Japanese
equities from investors outside the island nation. The New York-
based financial institution predicts gains in the U.S. currency
to 98 yen by the end of the year, less than its previous
estimate of 109 yen. One dollar bought 91.04 yen as of the U.S.
close today. 
The greenback will probably reach the 109 level versus the
yen by the end of 2011, Hull predicted.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit lost a bid
at Canada&#8217;s highest court to block a lawsuit that alleges the
menopause drug Premarin caused breast cancer. 
The Supreme Court of Canada today declined to hear Wyeth&#8217;s
appeal of a British Columbia decision denying the company&#8217;s
claim that its U.S. units couldn&#8217;t be sued in the province. The
high court gave no reason for its decision. 
The ruling clears the way for the suit to proceed to a
certification hearing in December, where plaintiff Dianna
Stanway will ask a judge to let all Canadian women who took
Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement medicines sue as a group, said David
Klein, Stanway&#8217;s lawyer at Klein Lyons in Vancouver. 
&#8220;About nine out of 10 pharmaceutical lawsuits in Canada
are certified,&#8221; Klein said in a phone interview. 
Wyeth&#8217;s U.S. and Canadian units were sued in 2006 by
Stanway, of Sechelt, British Columbia. Stanway claimed she
developed breast cancer as a result of taking estrogen-based
Premarin in combination with the drug progestin. Wyeth&#8217;s U.S.
units urged the appeals court to throw out the suit, claiming
British Columbia courts lacked jurisdiction to try the case. 
Wyeth sold and promoted the drug in Canada and its
&#8220;conduct amounts to personal subjection to the jurisdiction,&#8221;
Judge Kenneth Smith wrote on behalf of the appeals panel. &#8220;It
was therefore reasonable for them to contemplate they might be
sued in British Columbia.&#8221; 
&#8216;Acted Responsibly&#8217; 
The Supreme Court ruling was procedural and not a decision
on the merits of the case, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. 
&#8220;We continue to believe Wyeth acted responsibly by
conducting or supporting more than 180 studies on hormone
therapy&#8217;s benefits and risks,&#8221; Loder said. The company
&#8220;provided proper, accurate and science-based information to
patients and doctors.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker,
completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year. 
The Canadian suit won&#8217;t include women who took menopause
drugs that weren&#8217;t made by Wyeth, which had the biggest market
share in the country, or who suffered from other side effects,
Klein said. 
&#8220;This case is about breast cancer,&#8221; he said. 
The case is Wyeth Pharmaceuticals v. Dianna Louise Stanway,
33580, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa). The appeals court case
is Between Dianna Louise Stanway and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
CA036317, Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Vancouver).

Microsoft Corp. fell too far in a
selloff that pushed the software maker&#8217;s market value below
Apple Inc., according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, slumped 18 percent
in May through yesterday, when Apple of Cupertino, California,
was worth $2.94 billion more. Microsoft lost 4.1 percent
yesterday after Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said that
the effects of the European debt crisis will spread. 
&#8220;While European contagion is a concern, Ballmer&#8217;s comments
were not Microsoft specific,&#8221; Sarah Friar, an analyst at New
York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report to clients dated
yesterday. &#8220;The shares underperformed large-cap tech despite
having relatively lower exposure outside of the U.S. Given
significant underperformance and attractive valuation levels, we
are buyers of the shares.&#8221; 
Technology companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index had
retreated 11 percent this month through yesterday. Today,
Microsoft jumped 4 percent, the most since Oct. 23, to $26. 
Goldman&#8217;s Friar said that Microsoft&#8217;s fourth-quarter
earnings, scheduled for July 22, will show signs of improving
corporate demand for personal computers. On average, analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimate sales of $15.2 billion at the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, compared with $13.1 billion a
year earlier. 
Missing Estimates 
Microsoft reported third-quarter revenue last month that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions. Sales rose 6.3
percent to $14.5 billion, compared with analysts&#8217; estimates that
were as high as $14.8 billion for the quarter. 
While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have avoided purchases of machines and long-term contracts.
Investors held out for evidence of a spending resurgence after
chipmaker Intel Corp. forecast record profit margins for 2010. 
FBR Capital Markets Corp. today raised its rating for
Microsoft to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; also citing
the outlook for increased demand from corporations. 
Microsoft&#8217;s stock market value exceeded $400 billion in
2000 before falling to $227.9 billion today. Apple&#8217;s worth has
surged to $230.5 billion from less than $5 billion in 2003. 
&#8220;The stock market will take care of itself,&#8221; Ballmer said
in New Delhi today. &#8220;What&#8217;s the expression? On any given day
the stock market is a voting machine, in the long run only is it
a weighing machine. So let&#8217;s see what happens.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. lost a bid to have a
judge throw out a $9.4 million jury award to an Alabama woman
who developed breast cancer after taking the company&#8217;s menopause
drugs. 
A state-court judge in Philadelphia denied requests by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit to set aside the award to Audrey Singleton
or reduce the $6 million in punitive damages jurors awarded over
her use of the drugmaker&#8217;s hormone-replacement medicines.
Singleton&#8217;s lawyers alleged the company hid the drugs&#8217; health
risks. 
The judge&#8217;s ruling &#8220;validates the jury system and confirms
that this community is outraged by Wyeth&#8217;s conduct,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of Singleton&#8217;s lawyers, said in an interview
today. 
More than 6 million women have taken hormone-replacement
medicines to treat menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night
sweats and mood swings. Until 1995, many patients combined
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, with progestin-
laden Provera, made by another Pfizer unit. Wyeth combined the
two hormones in its Prempro medicine. 
&#8220;While we are disappointed in the trial court&#8217;s ruling, it
clears the way for the company to appeal this decision,&#8221; Pfizer
spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
stand by our belief that there is no basis in fact or law for
the jury&#8217;s verdict.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the menopause
medicines, which are still on the market. New York-based Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth last year. 
Litigation Record 
Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by jurors since the cases began going to trial in
2006. The company has persuaded judges to throw out some of
those verdicts at the post-trial stage and reduce awards in
others. 
Singleton, a retired school-bus driver from Chatom,
Alabama, began taking Prempro in August 1997. A mammogram at
that time was normal, her lawyers said during the trial. She
stopped taking the drug in January 2004 after her breast cancer
diagnosis. 
The woman&#8217;s lawyers argued in the case that Wyeth
executives hid or downplayed Prempro&#8217;s health risks as part of a
marketing campaign designed boost sales and put profits over
women&#8217;s health. 
Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before the 2002 Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggested
women using the medicines had a higher breast-cancer risk. 
No New Trial 
Jurors in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas concluded in
February Singleton deserved $3.45 million in compensatory
damages and $6 million in punishment damages over Wyeth&#8217;s
failure to properly warn about the drug&#8217;s risks. 
The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers asked Judge Mark Bernstein to throw
out the verdict and grant Wyeth a new trial or to cut
Singleton&#8217;s damage award. Bernstein denied the company&#8217;s request
in a May 20 order that was made public yesterday, according to
court records. 
Canada&#8217;s highest court today declined to hear Wyeth&#8217;s
appeal of a judge&#8217;s decision to allow a class-action case over
Premarin to proceed in that country&#8217;s courts. A group of
Canadian women are pressing claims that the drug helped cause
their breast cancers. 
The Philadelphia case is Singleton v. Wyeth Inc.,
050102885, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,
Pennsylvania.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, may cut the monthly fee it charges for streaming
music on its Zune portable player, senior product manager Terry
Farrell said in an interview. 
Zune Pass, which features unlimited music streaming and 10
song downloads a month, now costs $14.99. Farrell didn&#8217;t say by
how much Microsoft may cut the service&#8217;s price. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a challenging business,&#8221; Farrell said,
referring to competition in online music. 
Microsoft is contending with rivals that offer music at
little or no charge, while striving to erode Apple Inc.&#8217;s lead
in the market for digital music players and downloadable songs.
RealNetworks Inc.&#8217;s Rhapsody service in April slashed the
monthly price of a premium music service to $10 from $14.99. 
Zune had 2 percent of the U.S. digital music player market
in the first quarter, compared with 76 percent for Apple
products, according to NPD Group Inc., a Port Washington, New
York-based researcher. 
Users can access Microsoft&#8217;s download service on personal
computers and the company&#8217;s Zune players and Kin phones. The
company plans to offer the service on smartphones running its
Windows Phone 7 software later this year, Farrell said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may spend
$621 million to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
fraud suit that triggered a 13 percent one-day drop in the
firm&#8217;s stock, analyst Brad Hintz said. 
Negotiations between the SEC and Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable investment bank may end with Goldman Sachs paying a
fine of about $250 million, plus $371 million to reimburse
investors in the disputed trades, Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients today. 
&#8220;While this would be painful to Goldman, we believe it
would allow both Goldman Sachs and the SEC to walk away
declaring &#8216;victory&#8217;,&#8221; said Hintz, who has had an &#8220;outperform&#8221;
rating on the stock since June 2009. &#8220;Certainly Goldman wants
this case settled. Its management has stated that it wants a
&#8217;normal&#8217; relationship with its regulators.&#8221; 
The amount could reduce the New York-based firm&#8217;s earnings
per share by $1.05, or 5.4 percent of 2010 earnings, which are
estimated to be $19.55, according to the average estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. 
Goldman Sachs slumped on April 16 when the SEC accused
Goldman Sachs of defrauding investors in a collateralized debt
obligation linked to home loans. The firm concealed the fact
that Paulson  Co., a New York-based hedge fund, picked
components of the CDO and bet it would collapse, the agency
said. The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
55, has denied wrongdoing. 
SEC spokesman John Nester and Goldman Sachs spokesman
Michael Duvally declined to comment.

General Motors Corp.&#8217;s bankruptcy
estate won four more months to wind down under court protection,
an extension that a judge said was warranted because the company
must resolve asbestos and environmental liability claims. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in New York today gave
the bankrupt part of the automaker the exclusive right to
control its liquidation until this fall. The company has until
Sept. 27 to file a Chapter 11 plan and until Nov. 29 to solicit
creditor support. 
&#8220;Its obvious to anyone that, despite what&#8217;s been
accomplished so far, this is still a very, very large case with
some major issues,&#8221; Gerber said. 
The company, Motors Liquidation Co., is liquidating assets
of the former General Motors Corp. The still-operating Detroit-
based automaker is General Motors Co. 
Joseph H. Smolinsky, a lawyer for the company, told Gerber
that the uncertain size of asbestos claims and resolution of
environmental liabilities were holding back formulation of a
consensual plan. 
Progress has been made on environmental issues since
President Obama allocated $800 million last week to clean up and
develop 90 General Motors properties, Smolinsky said. 
&#8220;We can finally report some tangible, meaningful
progress,&#8221; the lawyer said, noting that the money would be put
into a trust for properties in 14 states that covers thousands
of acres around the U.S. 
U.S. Government 
&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time the federal government has spoken
with one voice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not only the Auto Task Force but
also the Environmental Protection Agency has worked with
materials we&#8217;ve provided to them.&#8221; 
Dean Trafalet, legal representative for holders of future
asbestos personal-injury claims, filed a court statement in
support of the extension, saying that due to the latency periods
for asbestos-related diseases, some victims may not be in a
position to assert claims yet. 
&#8220;The investigation of the debtors&#8217; current and future
asbestos-related liabilities is in its infancy,&#8221; Trafalet said,
noting that his group needed time to investigate all asbestos-
related liabilities. 
Unsecured creditors said they supported the extension, and
asked in court documents that the company outline its timeline
to exit Chapter 11 given &#8220;tens of thousands of unsecured
creditors&#8221; awaiting a distribution on their claims. 
Under GM&#8217;s transfer of its assets to new General Motors,
the debtor received 10 percent of stock in the new company and
15 percent of the warrants. Unsecured creditors say they expect
the stock and warrants will be distributed to them. 
The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia is
seeing growth in its swaps business that lets international
investors buy into the kingdom&#8217;s stock market and is looking
&#8220;closely&#8221; at exchange-traded funds. 
&#8220;Not only has the volume of trade been growing, but the
client base has been growing as well both in size and
diversification,&#8221; Habib Achkar, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s managing
director and regional manager for the Middle East and north
Africa, said in an interview in Dubai on May 25. 
Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia was set up three years ago when
it started a joint venture with the Capital Group, a Saudi-based
investment bank. In August 2008, Morgan Stanley began executing
swap transactions on behalf of non-resident foreign investors.
The Persian Gulf&#8217;s first exchange-traded fund opened March 25 on
the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
&#8220;We can execute ETF trades for Saudi, Gulf Cooperation
Council and international investors,&#8221; Chairman Fahad Almubarak
said in the joint interview on May 25. &#8220;At this stage we are
not a market maker, but it is certainly something we are looking
at very closely.&#8221; 
The world&#8217;s largest oil supplier is spending $400 billion
over five years, starting from 2008, to strengthen the economy
and help finance infrastructure projects. Saudi banks tightened
lending after Saad Group, the business owned by billionaire Maan al-Sanea, and Ahmad Hamad Al-Gosaibi  Brothers Co. defaulted on
loans last year. April bank claims on the private sector
increased an annual 3.2 percent compared with 2.4 percent in
March, according to central bank data. 
&#8216;Appetite&#8217; for Lending 
&#8220;We are definitely seeing an increase in bank lending,&#8221;
Almubarak said. &#8220;There&#8217;s appetite and competition to lend to
higher-quality corporates, but the banks have taken a much more
rigorous approach to their lending criteria.&#8221; 
Oil prices are down about 16 percent from a 19-month high
of $87.15 reached on May 3. Futures touched a record $147.27 on
July 11, 2008. 
Sabic Capital, a unit of Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,
delayed the sale of a bond because of unfavorable spreads, Saudi
Basic&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Mutlaq Al-Morished said
yesterday. 
&#8220;We are working on a number of bond mandates which we may
see as early as the second half of the year,&#8221; Almubarak said.

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the
world&#8217;s largest brokerage, cut about 200 jobs as the joint
venture moves closer to full integration, according to a person
with knowledge of the reductions. 
The cuts were mostly from product support areas and didn&#8217;t
involve brokers, said the person, who declined to be named
because the reductions aren&#8217;t public. The brokerage also plans
to hire about 150 private bankers and 35 employees for the
unit&#8217;s capital markets operations, the person said. 
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who led the unit
before succeeding John Mack in January, said earlier this year
that the joint venture expects to realize $1.1 billion of cost
savings by the end of 2011. The division reported pretax income
of $278 million for the first quarter, compared with $119
million in same period a year earlier, before the deal was
completed. 
The brokerage, which has $1.6 trillion in client assets,
was formed last year when Morgan Stanley purchased a controlling
stake in the joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. 
The joint venture will probably close about 120 additional
U.S. offices to eliminate overlapping locations, Charles Johnston, the unit&#8217;s president, said last month. Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney had 18,140 advisers as of March 31, and Johnston
said that figure will likely stay around 18,000. 
&#8220;As we near our one-year anniversary, we are well along in
the integration of the two firms,&#8221; Morgan Stanley spokesman Jim Wiggins said. 
The brokerage&#8217;s pretax profit margin was 9 percent in the
first quarter, up from 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Gorman
has said the firm expects to increase that margin to 15 percent
by the end of this year and more than 20 percent by the end of
2011. 
Fox Business Network reported the job cuts earlier today.

Morgan Stanley more than doubled
Chairman John Mack&#8217;s annual base salary to $2 million effective
June 1, according to a regulatory filing by the bank. 
Mack&#8217;s base salary had been $800,000, and he had opted to
forgo a bonus for the last three years. His salary hadn&#8217;t
increased since he rejoined the New York-based firm in 2005 as
chairman and chief executive officer, according to today&#8217;s
filing. 
Mack, 65, stepped down as CEO at the end of last year,
having led the company through its first quarterly loss in 2007
and the financial crisis in 2008. Mack told shareholders at a
meeting earlier this month that he would resign as chairman if
current CEO James Gorman ever told him he was in the way. 
The raise followed the firm&#8217;s strategy &#8220;to move away from
a compensation program focused largely on annual incentive
awards toward one that is balanced between fixed, short-term and
long-term compensation and to be in line with his new role and
responsibilities as executive chairman of the company&#8217;s Board of
Directors,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said in the filing.

International Business Machines Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano will probably cede the
post next year, raising the possibility of the first female or
first black CEO in the 99-year-old company&#8217;s history. 
Three of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives have stepped down
at 60, with the exception being John Akers, who was forced out
by IBM&#8217;s board before he reached that age. Palmisano, who has
led the company for more than eight years, will hit that mark
next July. IBM&#8217;s tradition of CEOs stepping aside at 60 helps
retain top executives, said Val Rahmani, former general manager
of an IBM security software business. 
&#8220;People need to see that there&#8217;s the opportunity to
progress,&#8221; said Rahmani, who left IBM last year and is now CEO
of the Atlanta-based security software firm Damballa Inc. She
said Palmisano will probably retire next year. &#8220;There&#8217;s loads
of speculation going on at the moment.&#8221; 
IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, has
brought in a CEO from outside the company only once, when it
named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed Akers in 1993. The likely
candidates this time are internal, including the senior vice
presidents who oversee sales, hardware, consulting and
technology services. Steve Mills, the well-respected senior vice
president for software, may be unlikely to take over the top
post since he also turns 60 next year.

Morgan Stanley more than doubled
Chairman John Mack&#8217;s annual base salary to $2 million, the first
increase since he rejoined the firm in 2005. 
Mack&#8217;s raise is effective June 1, the New York-based firm
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Mack&#8217;s base salary as
chairman and chief executive officer had been $800,000, and he
has opted to forgo a year-end bonus for the last three years. 
Mack, 65, stepped down as CEO at the end of last year,
having led the company through its first quarterly loss in 2007
and the financial crisis in 2008. Mack told shareholders at a
meeting earlier this month that he would resign as chairman if
current CEO James Gorman ever told him he was in the way. 
Mack&#8217;s raise is &#8220;in line with his new role and
responsibilities as executive chairman of the company&#8217;s Board of
Directors,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said in the filing. It follows the
firm&#8217;s strategy &#8220;to move away from a compensation program
focused largely on annual incentive awards.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley last month reported its largest quarterly
profit since 2007, as it recovers from the crisis that included
a $10 billion bailout from the government in 2008 and the bank&#8217;s
first annual per-share loss in 2009. Last year, it repaid the
taxpayer funds and took a controlling stake in a joint venture
with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage. 
Shareholders voted against a proposal earlier this month
that would have required the chairman be an independent director
who hasn&#8217;t previously served as an executive officer of the
company. 
200 Jobs Cut 
Mack said earlier this year that compensation on Wall
Street was too high and proposed an &#8220;open discussion&#8221; between
major investment banks and regulators to address the issue. Mack
hasn&#8217;t taken a cash bonus since he took the helm of the firm in
2005. He received a $40 million stock bonus in 2006. 
The firm also cut about 200 jobs in Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney brokerage, a person with knowledge of the reductions said
yesterday. The cuts were mostly from product support areas and
didn&#8217;t involve brokers, said the person, who declined to be
named because the reductions aren&#8217;t public. 
The brokerage also plans to hire about 150 private bankers
and 35 employees for the unit&#8217;s capital markets operations, the
person said.

The acquisitions will most likely be abroad because of

Morgan Stanley hired Kazunobu Ezawa,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director, for its
fixed-income business in Japan, according to an internal company
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Ezawa, 42, this month joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities
Co., a joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
to help boost fixed-income sales to listed Japanese companies
and add new clients, the Morgan Stanley memo said. 
New York-based Morgan Stanley in April posted earnings that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue more
than doubled from a year earlier. The bank follows UBS AG and
other overseas banks in luring executives away from rivals in
Japan after the value of domestic bond transactions in the
country rose 12 percent to 16 trillion yen ($174 billion) last
year. 
Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
confirmed the hiring, without commenting further. Ezawa wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for comment. 
Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ started two joint
ventures this month for investment banking and trading. Teaming
up with Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in the Wall
Street firm in 2008, may help Morgan Stanley bolster its ranking
in advising on Japanese mergers and securities underwriting. 
Mitsubishi UFJ ranked second in Japanese domestic bond
underwriting last year and Morgan Stanley ranked eighth,
according to Bloomberg data. 
First-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading
at Morgan Stanley jumped to $2.7 billion last quarter from $1.29
billion a year earlier helping it return to a net income of
$1.78 billion in the period, it said in a statement on April 21. 
Ezawa will be a managing director at the bank, according to
the internal memo. 
UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, earlier this month hired
former Nomura Holdings Inc. executive Zenji Nakamura to run its
fixed income, currencies and commodities unit in Japan. Bank of
America Corp. last month recruited Tomomi Kikuchi from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to head sales of mortgage-backed securities in Japan.
Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of Bank of America,
in April appointed Kikuchi as a managing director.

China&#8217;s stocks may &#8220;meander&#8221; at
current levels for the next few months on concern that policy
tightening and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will derail global growth,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Jing Ulrich. 
&#8220;In the near term, we still remain quite cautious on both
A shares and H shares because you still have a lot of
uncertainty in China,&#8221; Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities and
commodities at JPMorgan, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview, referring to yuan-denominated Chinese stocks and
those traded in Hong Kong. &#8220;Globally, in Europe, people are
beginning to question the global economic recovery, whether
that&#8217;s intact,&#8221; she said. 
The Shanghai Composite Index lost 9.7 percent last month,
the most since August, and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
retreated 5.6 percent as the government raised bank reserve
requirements for a third time this year and Europe stepped up
measures to cut budget deficits. Europe is China&#8217;s biggest
export destination, making up 20 percent of total overseas sales. 
Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in May,
data showed today, adding to signs that growth may moderate in
the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy. 
Real estate closings in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in
May plunged as contract numbers dropped by as much as 70 percent
from April, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
data from a local property website, a property agent and the
government. 
Property Curbs 
&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly seeing momentum slowing. Back in mid
April, the Chinese government introduced a series of measures to
tighten control of the property sector,&#8221; Ulrich said. &#8220;Since
then we&#8217;ve seen transaction volumes fall, we&#8217;ve seen the stock
market correcting and in the meantime, I think the sentiment is
spilling over to the industrial sector as well.&#8221; 
Stocks will only rally when government policy stabilizes
and &#8220;uncertainties&#8221; removed, she said. 
In the last two weeks of April, the government raised
mortgage rates and down payment ratios, barred lending for
third-home purchases and ordered tighter scrutiny of developers&#8217;
financing to restrain property prices that surged 11.7 percent
in March. 
The Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index fell to 53.9 from 55.7 in
April, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
That was less than the median 54.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News
economist survey. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion. A
separate purchasing managers&#8217; index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics fell to 52.7 in May from 55.2 in April.

Walt Disney Co. aims to almost double
annual retail sales of licensed merchandise in five to seven
years after buying comic-book and film maker Marvel
Entertainment in December. 
Products licensed by Disney may reach $50 billion in sales,
compared with $27 billion in fiscal 2009, Andrew Mooney, head of
the Burbank, California-based company&#8217;s consumer-products
division, said today on a webcast presentation. 
The company plans to open a redesigned store in New York&#8217;s
Times Square this fall as the U.S. continues to recover from the
recession, Mooney said. Disney&#8217;s media networks, the biggest
division, contributed 71 percent of operating income last year,
compared with 9 percent from consumer products. 
Products tied to &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; in theaters June 18, will
sell $2.4 billion in related merchandise, Mooney said. &#8220;Cars&#8221;
has averaged $2 billion annually in retail sales of branded
products since its 2006 release. A &#8220;Cars&#8221; sequel, due in
theaters next year, may set a record for merchandise sales, he
said. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, climbed $1.41,
or 4.2 percent, to $34.74 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year.

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s largest
media company, went on trial over claims it cheated the U.K.
creator of the &#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; game show
through self-dealing. 
Celador International Ltd. sued Disney six years ago,
alleging Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied
promise by failing to negotiate a higher license fee with
Disney&#8217;s ABC television network after the show proved a hit.
Celador says that prevented Buena Vista from making a bigger
profit it would have had to share with the creators. 
&#8220;They agreed that BVT would only be paid enough money to
cover the cost of making the show and BVT would never make a
profit,&#8221; Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for Celador, said today
during his opening statement in federal court in Riverside,
California. &#8220;When they got through making their secret deal,
the ad revenue was shielded, no one could ever get to it.&#8221; 
The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift ABC to first place from third in audience ratings in
2000, prompting the network to run the program four times a
week. &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998
and has been carried in 106 countries, including Australia,
India, Japan, Germany and Russia, Celador said. 
Share of Profit 
Closely held Celador entered into an agreement with Buena
Vista, a production and distribution unit of Disney, and ABC in
1998 that entitled the creators to a share of the profit from
the show in North America, according to a 2006 amended
complaint. Silberfeld said Buena Vista made an &#8220;implied promise&#8221;
in the agreement to &#8220;act in good faith&#8221; to obtain the highest
possible price for the show. 
Instead, Celador said in its lawsuit, ABC paid below-market
value for &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; because Buena Vista, at Disney&#8217;s
behest, didn&#8217;t seek a higher fee after the show became a
success. The creators also claim Disney, using an affiliated
production company, inflated production costs. 
The creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the
network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; as well as $16 million for
merchandising, Silberfeld said today. 
Disney&#8217;s lawyer Martin Katz responded in his opening
statement that Buena Vista has shopped the show to other
networks who weren&#8217;t interested. 
&#8220;Buena Vista took the financial risk and there was no
secret deal between Buena Vista and ABC,&#8221; Katz said. &#8220;The
division of rights between ABC and BTV is just how one would
expect division of rights to be,&#8221; Katz said. 
Celador so far has received $19.2 million in production
fees for the shows, $13 million for the network broadcasts, $6.2
million for syndicated shows, Katz said. 
The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.,
04-3541, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Riverside.)

Walt Disney Co. isn&#8217;t considering
delaying sales of its DVDs to video-rental kiosk operator Redbox
as other studios have, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said. 
Iger, speaking at a conference sponsored by Sanford C.
Bernstein today, said Disney hasn&#8217;t seen any cannibalization of
new DVD sales from Coinstar Inc.&#8217;s Redbox, which rents movies
for $1 a day. 
Disney has a higher ratio between box-office and home
entertainment sales than rivals who are delaying titles to
Redbox, Iger said. Redbox agreed to begin carrying discs 28 days
after DVDs from Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros. and Universal
Studios go on sale. In return, Redbox receives discounts that
are unacceptable to Disney, Iger said. 
&#8220;We would not have made as much money,&#8221; Iger said.
&#8220;Selling them units at a 50 percent reduction in cost, or
whatever the proposition, even for the 28-day window was not an
equation that made sense to us.&#8221; 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained $1.09 to
$34.42 at 12:20 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares climbed 3.4 percent this year before today. 
Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York,
criticized Iger today in a report for allowing &#8220;Alice in
Wonderland&#8221; to be available in Redbox kiosks. 
&#8220;A key thesis behind our buy rating on Disney is the
dramatic improvement we expect in studio&#160;entertainment&#160;over the
coming year,&#8221; Greenfield wrote. &#8220;Disney should want us to buy,
not rent for $1/day.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Ian Henderson,
manager of $7 billion in natural-resource assets, sold about a
quarter of his combined Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd.
holdings on concern a proposed Australian tax will curb growth. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say we&#8217;ve reduced our Australian exposure,&#8221;
Henderson said in a phone interview today. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a wake-up
call frankly. I had not thought that the changes in Australia
would be quite as drastic as they are proposed to be.&#8221; 
Australia last month said it planned to impose a 40 percent
tax on mining company profits from 2012 to raise A$12 billion
($10 billion) in the first two years of the changes. Rio, BHP
and Xstrata Plc are reviewing the viability of some projects in
the country and are pressing for changes to the plan. 
&#8220;It clearly does reduce the attractions of developing new
projects in Australia and indeed investing in Australian-based
mining ventures,&#8221; Henderson, who has been a fund manager with
JPMorgan since 1991, said from London. &#8220;It has made people
aware of the potential for these industries to be used as milk
cows by governments. That has altered the risk profile for the
mining industry probably for quite a long time.&#8221; 
Rio, the third-largest mining company, had been Henderson&#8217;s
top holding, comprising about 4.5 percent of his funds,
including the Global Natural Resources Fund. The stake in the
company &#8220;has been reduced by about $100 million,&#8221; he said. The
fund returned 111 percent in 2009, according to Bloomberg data. 
While Henderson cut stakes in companies with Australian
assets shortly after the tax plan was announced, he has raised
holdings of gold miners. Prices of the metal are up 11 percent
this year and reached a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14. 
Buying Gold 
&#8220;Our gold exposure has gone up over the past couple of
months,&#8221; Henderson said. 
Among the companies likely to be affected by the taxation
plan, Henderson also made a &#8220;reasonably significant&#8221; reduction
in his holdings of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. 
Fortescue, Australia&#8217;s third-largest iron ore exporter, put
about $15 billion of projects on hold because of the plan, the
Perth-based company said May 19. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the
world&#8217;s third-largest gold producer, will also cut exploration
spending in the country if the tax is approved, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Cutifani said today by phone from Canberra. 
Rio, based in London, fell 1.4 percent to 3,107.5 pence by
12:31 p.m. in the city and has dropped 7.9 percent since the
plan was announced on May 2. Melbourne-based BHP declined 1.7
percent and is down 8.9 percent from May 2. 
Rio yesterday said it was paying its &#8220;fair share&#8221; of
taxes after contributing more than $20 billion in the past
decade. Xstrata Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said the
proposed levy may prompt companies to cancel investments. 
Immovable Feast 
&#8220;Resources are immovable but diversified mining companies
have a choice of countries in which to invest,&#8221; Davis wrote in
a letter today in the Financial Times. &#8220;Investments in
Australian resources are at risk of being delayed or
cancelled.&#8221; Xstrata is based in Zug, Switzerland. 
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday vowed to push ahead
with his proposals, which will apply to profits on resource
projects above the long-term bond rate, currently about 6
percent. Australia is the biggest exporter of coal and iron ore.

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney fired
George Friedlander, a municipal bond strategist for more than
three decades, as it integrates two formerly separate firms,
according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Friedlander, 62, worked at Citigroup Inc. and its
predecessors for 34 years, publishing weekly analysis of the
U.S. municipal market. He joined the Morgan Stanley unit in
2009. The world&#8217;s largest brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in
client assets, was formed last year as a joint venture when
Morgan Stanley bought control of the Smith Barney broker unit of
Citigroup. 
Friedlander was among 200 employees let go, mostly from
product support areas, according to a person with knowledge of
the reductions. Friedlander declined to comment, citing a
confidentiality agreement. Jim Wiggins, a Morgan Stanley
spokesman, declined to comment. 
Friedlander, who provided market and portfolio ideas to
rich investors and institutional clients, was named to
Institutional Investor&#8217;s &#8220;All-American Research Team&#8221; for 14
years, according to his biography. He was a member of the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association&#8217;s
municipal division executive committee for 29 years. In 1997,
Friedlander received the association&#8217;s Chairman&#8217;s Contribution
Award, for service to the industry. 
Friedlander graduated from the State University of New York
at Stony Brook with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in mathematics. He
received a master&#8217;s degree in business administration from Pace
University in New York. 
The Bond Buyer newspaper reported Friedlander&#8217;s firing
earlier today.

Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s new motion-
detecting video gaming device, being shown at an electronics
conference this month, may help revive slowing sales of its Xbox
console. 
Code-named Natal, the device will be an add-on to the Xbox
360, which has shipped 40&#160;million units in five years and trails
only Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii. Natal sits in front of the TV and has
built-in sensors, letting users play games without a controller.
Natal picks up the motion while gamers drive a pretend car or
swing a virtual baseball bat, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in
its June 7 issue. 
Reinvigorating Xbox&#160;360 sales may help Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft delay having to field a new machine, which would
lose hundreds of millions of dollars for a few years. Xbox sales
have slowed since Sony Corp. cut the price of the PlayStation 3
console last summer. Natal&#8217;s technology is another step in
Microsoft&#8217;s decade-long push to move beyond PCs and into game
consoles, music players and smartphones. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a bunch of third party games to take
advantage of the Natal technology,&#8221; says Katherine Egbert, an
analyst with Jeffries  Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;This will create
a product cycle for the gaming division without a new console.&#8221;

technology conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. He
didn&#8217;t give a timeframe. At the same time, Apple has &#8220;done a
good job&#8221; and Google&#8217;s Android has become a &#8220;real
competitor,&#8221; the executive said. 
Microsoft last week announced the resignation of Robbie Bach as head of the division that sells software for mobile
devices, following the company&#8217;s share losses to Apple and other
new entrants. Microsoft aims to revive growth with its own
mobile phone -- a first for the Redmond, Washington-based
company -- and a new Windows mobile program later this year. 
Another competitor, Research In Motion Ltd., has done well
expanding the audience for its BlackBerry among consumers,
Ballmer said at the conference. 
Earlier during his on-stage interview, the executive said
technology spending by businesses is rebounding. 
&#8220;At least for now, we continue to see developed countries&#8217;
business coming back,&#8221; he said. 
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in April
that the company is seeing signs of improvement in demand and
businesses had started spending on personal computers again. 
Still, Ballmer said last week on a trip to Singapore that
any economic problems in Europe will have a &#8220;ripple impact&#8221;
elsewhere. 
Microsoft rose 40 cents to $26.86 as of 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have fallen 12
percent this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s London unit
was fined a record 33.3 million pounds ($48.6 million) by
Britain&#8217;s financial regulator for not properly separating client
money from the firm&#8217;s accounts. 
An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement today. As much as $23 billion of client money held by
the bank&#8217;s futures and options business wasn&#8217;t put in separate
overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the FSA said. 
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman&#8217;s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. 
&#8220;The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected,&#8221; said
Margaret Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement director. &#8220;This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline.&#8221; 
Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. 
Reduced Fine 
JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA&#8217;s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients&#8217; money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts. 
The breach was &#8220;regretful,&#8221; according to an internal memo
by JPMorgan Securities Chief Executive Officer Daniel Pinto and
obtained by Bloomberg News. 
&#8220;The settlement involves us paying a fine based on a fixed
formula of 1 percent of the average amount of client money held
by our FO business,&#8221; Pinto said in the memo. &#8220;As the FSA
acknowledges, JPMorgan Securities Ltd. is one of the largest
holders of client money in the U.K., and the size of the fine
reflects that.&#8221; 
&#8216;Patently Inconsistent&#8217; 
The error stemmed from the 2000 merger of JPMorgan  Co.
with the Chase Manhattan Corp., according to the FSA&#8217;s
investigative report. After the merger the combined treasury
function didn&#8217;t recognize client money from the futures and
options business, according to the report. 
The regulator said in January that two firms that it didn&#8217;t
identify faced a penalty after the FSA started investigations
into how they held client money. Those inquiries were started at
the same time as a London judge ruled that the FSA&#8217;s client-
money rules were &#8220;patently inconsistent and flawed&#8221; in a case
over the administration of Lehman&#8217;s European unit. 
The regulator said at the time that it would consult on
changes to parts of its rulebook, specifically over transfer
arrangements and on firms keeping buffers that could top up
client-money accounts. Proposals are scheduled later this year. 
&#8220;The client-money regime was neglected by the FSA prior to
the financial crisis,&#8221; said Darren Fox, a regulatory lawyer at
Simmons  Simmons advising a hedge fund in the Lehman case. &#8220;I
wonder whether today&#8217;s fine is symptomatic of the FSA&#8217;s guilty
conscience in relation to the Lehman client-money failings, for
which the FSA received a fair bit of flak.&#8221; 
Tougher Approach 
Today&#8217;s fine is nearly twice as much the then-record 17
million-pound fine levied against Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2004
for market abuse. 
The agency has said fines will increase as part of its new
tougher approach following the financial crisis. In some cases,
penalty size will triple. 
The U.K.&#8217;s coalition government has said it will merge some
of the FSA&#8217;s enforcement powers with other prosecutors to form a
white-collar crime agency even in the wake of increased
penalties and criminal cases filed by the FSA. 
The FSA may also lose its independence to the Bank of
England and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is
considering scrapping it, the Guardian newspaper reported today,
citing government sources. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see they&#8217;re doing their job; they&#8217;ve got to
crack down on abuses,&#8221; Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat
lawmaker who is the coalition government&#8217;s business secretary,
said of today&#8217;s fine in a Bloomberg TV interview. &#8220;The basic
point, which I know the chancellor is trying to ensure, is that
the Bank of England has proper oversight of systemic risk. How
you do it administratively is not an easy task.&#8221; 
Amid the uncertainty, the FSA enforcement team separately
suffered a defeat today with its first loss of an insider-
trading trial. Two lawyers and a former chief financial officer
were cleared today by a London court in the regulator&#8217;s fourth
criminal case of insider dealing to reach jury trial.

Ian Henderson, who manages about $7
billion in natural-resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
added to his holdings in gold mining companies in the last two
months as the metal advanced to a record. 
Shares of precious-metal and diamond mining companies now
account for 39 percent of holdings, Henderson said in an
interview from London yesterday. His funds reduced holdings in
companies with links to Australia after the government announced
a mining tax, freeing up cash for the gold purchases, he said. 
Gold climbed to a record $1,249.40 an ounce on May 14 and
is set for a 10th consecutive annual advance, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920. Fund managers including
George Soros and John Paulson bought bullion as investors sought
to protect themselves from plunging stock markets after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 and this
year&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. 
&#8220;Gold mining stocks are as cheap as they&#8217;ve been for a
long time because for the first time in years they are making
proper profits,&#8221; Henderson said. Gold and precious metals
accounted for 34.1 percent of holdings at the end of April, he
said at a conference in London today. 
Barrick Gold Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest gold mining
company, is trading at 18.9 times earnings, down from as much as
26.6 times in December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Toronto-based company in April reported first-quarter profit
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. Newmont Mining Corp., the largest
U.S. gold producer, trades at 16.4 times earnings, down from
26.7 times in December. 
&#8216;Strongest Since 1970s&#8217; 
&#8220;Gold in portfolios is the strongest it&#8217;s been since the
1970s,&#8221; Henderson said today. 
Henderson&#8217;s 1.9 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) Gl obal Natural
Resources fund and 1.95 billion-pound ($2.9 billion) U.K.
Natural Resources own shares in both Barrick and Newmont.
Barrick has climbed 8.1 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange
this year and Newmont is up 18 percent in New York trading. 
Henderson also reduced holdings in uranium mining
companies on expectations that supply will continue to outpace
demand, he said. 
Uranium was at $40.75 a pound this week, according to
Roswell, Georgia-based Ux Consulting Co. The metal, used in
nuclear reactors, reached a record $136 a pound in 2007. 
Investments in energy companies account for about 27
percent of the assets in Henderson&#8217;s funds, with about 29
percent in iron ore and industrial metals and the rest in
fertilizers and agriculture.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for U.S. payrolls in May to 600,000 from a prior
estimate of 500,000, the company&#8217;s chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note today to clients. 
The government probably hired 450,000 temporary workers to
conduct the census, 100,000 more than the firm&#8217;s previous
estimate, Hatzius said. Goldman&#8217;s estimate for private sector
hiring held at 150,000. It also forecasts the unemployment rate
will fall to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent. 
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the Labor
Department will report tomorrow that payrolls climbed by 523,000
in May, boosted by census hiring. Estimates ranged from 220,000
to 750,000. 
Private payrolls probably rose 178,000 after a gain of
231,000 in April, according to the survey median. The
unemployment rate fell to 9.8 percent, the survey showed.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may be interested in buying parts of
American International Group Inc.&#8217;s operations in Asia, two
people familiar with the matter said. 
The Italian insurer would consider an acquisition if AIG
decides to sell units rather than pursue an initial public
offering for AIA Group Ltd., the holding company controlling the
Asian businesses, said the people, who asked not be identified
because the matter is confidential. 
Generali, which weighed a bid for AIG&#8217;s Chinese business at
the end of 2008, is expanding in emerging markets, including
China and the Middle East, to offset the impact of the worst
recession in more than 30 years in Italy last year. 
Generali would have to sell shares to finance a purchase,
Alberto Villa, an analyst at Milan-based brokerage Intermonte
Sim SpA, wrote in a note yesterday. The failure of talks to sell
AIA Group to London-based Prudential Plc &#8220;may open the interest
of Generali for some activities in case of a break up,&#8221; he
said. 
A Generali spokesman said it&#8217;s premature to discuss the
matter given that AIG hasn&#8217;t decided how to proceed. The Italian
insurer&#8217;s interest in AIG assets was reported by newspaper MF
earlier today. 
AIG, which is selling assets to repay its $182.3 billion
U.S. bailout, is revisiting plans for a Hong Kong offering of
AIA Group after the collapse of the Prudential deal. The U.K.
insurer said yesterday it terminated an agreement to buy the AIG
unit for $35.5 billion and cancelled a rights offering linked to
the acquisition.

Johnson Matthey Plc, producer of a
third of all autocatalysts, posted a 5.6 percent decline in
full-year profit and said first-half earnings will be
&#8220;significantly&#8221; higher than a year earlier. 
Net income slipped to 164.2 million pounds ($241.9 million)
in the year through March from 173.9 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Profit trailed the 173.3 million-pound average estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;Whilst considerable short-term uncertainties about the
global economy remain, the group is expected to make good
progress in the first half,&#8221; the company said in the statement.
&#8220;Underlying profit before tax should be significantly higher&#8221;
than a year earlier. 
Johnson Matthey rose as much as 2.3 percent to 1,591 pence
in London trading, and was at 1,575 pence as of 8:04 a.m. local
time. 
The company&#8217;s autocatalyst division will &#8220;perform well&#8221;
in the first half as the withdrawal of government incentives for
consumers to replace older cars takes time to feed through to
the business, Johnson Matthey said. The performance of the
platinum refining unit is &#8220;much stronger&#8221; than a year earlier,
it said. 
Sales were little changed at 7.84 billion pounds.

General Motors Co., the best selling
overseas automaker in China, said sales in the nation rose at
the weakest pace last month since March 2009, as growth slowed
at its SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co. joint venture. 
GM and its partners in China sold 196,004 vehicles in May,
an increase of 25.4 percent from a year earlier, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. Its rate of growth was in
line with the wider passenger-car market, which grew 25 percent
to 885,000 vehicles in May, the China Automotive Technology 
Research Center said on June 1. 
Falling stock prices and rising inflation are eroding
wealth in the world&#8217;s largest automobile market. Meanwhile,
buyers are becoming cautious after the government introduced
measures to clamp down on a property market bubble, said Yale Zhang, a Shanghai-based director at CSM Asia, an automotive
consulting company. 
&#8220;This is not a single carmaker&#8217;s problem, it&#8217;s the
market&#8217;s problem,&#8221; Zhang said in a phone interview today.
After record-high sales last year demand growth is getting
weaker each month, he said 
Liuzhou-based SAIC-GM-Wuling, which accounts for over half
of GM&#8217;s China volume, increased sales by 5.2 percent to 105,395
units in May, GM said. That&#8217;s down from an 18.9 percent increase
in April, 42.6 percent in March and a gain of 37.7 percent in
February, according to GM&#8217;s website. 
$4,000 Mini Vehicles 
The partnership, which sells mini vehicles including
Sunshine vans for as little as $4,000 each, is 34 percent-owned
by the U.S. automaker. SAIC Motor Corp., China&#8217;s largest
domestic car company, owns 50.1 percent and Liuzhou Wuling
Automotive Co. owns 15.9 percent. 
The unit&#8217;s relatively low growth is explained by strong
sales in the month a year earlier, CSM Asia&#8217;s Zhang said. New
models may help GM may do better than other carmakers this year,
he said. 
Sales at Shanghai General Motors Co., a venture with SAIC
Motor, which makes Buicks in China, rose 48.7 percent from a
year earlier to 83,302 units, according to the statement. 
The 25 percent growth rate for Chinese passenger car sales
in May compares with April&#8217;s 34 percent advance, according to
the automotive center. 
GM China President Kevin Wale said last month that while
the country&#8217;s car sales growth will slow this year, the
automaker is keeping a forecast to sell than 2 million cars this
year. 
&#8216;Industry Cycle&#8217; 
Weaker growth is &#8220;a natural part of the industry cycle,&#8221;
Wale said at a conference in Ningbo, a city in the eastern part
of China, on May 16. &#8220;Underlying demand is very strong.&#8221; 
GM and its partners in the nation sold 1.03 million units
in the first five months of the year, an increase of 53.9
percent from a year earlier, the Detroit-based company said
today. 
China, which overtook the U.S. as the world&#8217;s biggest auto
market last year, is GM&#8217;s largest market. The carmaker aims to
sell 3 million vehicles a year in China by 2015. It plans to
introduce 25 new or updated models in the country by the end of
2011.

Inside an industrial warehouse in
South San Francisco, California, Harrison Dillon, chief
technology officer of startup Solazyme Inc., examines a beaker
filled with a brown paste made of sugar cane waste. While the
smell brings to mind molasses, this goo, called bagasse, won&#8217;t
find its way into people-pleasing confections. 
Instead, scientists will empty it into 5-gallon metal
flasks of algae and water. The algae will gorge on the treat --
filling themselves with fatty oils as they double in size every
six hours, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its July issue. 
Down the hall, past a rainbow of algae strains arrayed in
Petri dishes, Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Wolfson shows off
a gallon-size bottle of slightly viscous liquid. After drying
the algae, wringing out the oil and shipping it to a refinery,
this is the prize: diesel fuel that Wolfson says is chemically
indistinguishable from its petroleum-based equivalent and which
has already powered a Jeep Liberty and a Mercedes Benz sedan. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve produced tens of thousands of gallons, and by the
end of 2010, I hope I can say we&#8217;ve produced hundreds of
thousands,&#8221; Wolfson, 39, says. &#8220;In the next two years, we
should get the cost down to the $60 to $80-a-barrel range.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is facing a
tough operating environment that could affect earnings,
according to two analysts who released notes to investors today. 
Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners analysts led by Jeff Harte said
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told them in
a recent meeting that market participants are in a state of
paralysis because of fear and uncertainty regarding economic
challenges in Europe and regulatory changes. 
Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities cut his estimates for
Goldman&#8217;s earnings and stock price because of the debt crisis in
Europe and because &#8220;the current business environment is weak,&#8221;
according to a note he sent investors. Bove cut his estimate for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2010 earnings to $17.17 a share from an earlier
estimate of $18.72 and slashed his share price target to $182
from $200. 
Goldman Sachs, the bank facing a fraud lawsuit from the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, reported record
earnings in 2009 and its second-best quarter ever in the first
three months of the year. The stock is down $1.09 to $142.95 at
3 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading today and
has dropped 15 percent so far this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged a
$450 million collateralized loan obligation, according to people
familiar with the transaction, making it the third widely
syndicated transaction of the year. 
Last week&#8217;s deal marks a reversal for CLO issuance, which
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, fell to $26.5 billion in
2009, its lowest level in more than a decade as the credit
crisis and subsequent drop in loan prices made it economically
difficult to arrange new funds. Loan prices on the SP/LSTA US
Leveraged Loan 100 Index ended at 89.07 cents on the dollar
yesterday, gaining 50 percent since Dec. 17, 2008, and helping
lure investors back to these types of investments. 
&#8220;There are still a lot of challenges for the new-issue
market to emerge in a robust form, but it&#8217;s certainly the case
that it has begun to thaw a bit,&#8221; said Vishwanath Tirupattur,
an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. &#8220;The signs are
positive.&#8221; 
Citigroup Inc. priced a $525 million CLO overseen by WCAS
Fraser Sullivan Investment Management LLC in March, the first
new issue backed by widely syndicated loans in a year. The bank
also arranged a $325 million loan package last month for Apollo
Management LP, the first deal of the year backed by new-issue
debt. Both deals were increased from initial plans, bringing
total issuance this year to $1.3 billion.

Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Asia Chairman
Stephen Roach will return to New York from Hong Kong, ending a
three-year stay in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing region, to take a
teaching post at Yale University. 
Roach, formerly the firm&#8217;s chief economist, will remain
with Morgan Stanley and assume the role of non-executive
chairman for Asia from July 1, the New York-based company said
in a statement today. 
The 64-year-old economist, who has predicted China will
overtake the U.S. as the dominant economy by 2025, relocated to
Hong Kong in 2007 to lead a push to arrange more takeovers and
stock sales in the region. Roach, who joined Morgan Stanley in
1982, said he wants to rejoin his family after three years
&#8220;living out of a suitcase&#8221; in Asia and plans to use the
teaching post to correct &#8220;misperceptions&#8221; of China. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not walking away from Morgan Stanley,&#8221; Roach said in
a telephone interview today. &#8220;I have a lot of our clients and
will continue to spend as much time with them in the future as I
have in the past.&#8221; 
Roach will travel regularly for Morgan Stanley and &#8220;stay
connected to clients, governments and regulators in Asia and
other parts of the world,&#8221; the firm said in today&#8217;s statement. 
He is also accepting a joint appointment at the Jackson
Institute for Global Affairs and the School of Management,
according to the statement.

Attorney Olivier Metzner says
thousands of Societe Generale SA&#8217;s own computer records will
clear his client, Jerome Kerviel, of responsibility for the
bank&#8217;s record 4.9 billion-euro ($6 billion) trading loss,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Alan Katz and Heather Smith report. 
Riding through Paris in his chauffeur-driven Jaguar XF,
Metzner, 60, chuckles. He suspects that his success in getting
that data -- more than a year after French investigators had
completed their probe without digging into them -- unnerved
prosecutors. 
&#8220;Ah, yes, I irritate the powers that be,&#8221; said Metzner. 
Metzner took over Kerviel&#8217;s defense more than a year after
the 33-year-old former trader was blamed for Societe Generale&#8217;s
loss. Kerviel goes on trial June 8 for abuse of trust, faking
documents and computer hacking. He faces as many as five years
in jail if found guilty. 
The trial pits him against France&#8217;s second-biggest bank by
market value. The bank&#8217;s former chairman, Daniel Bouton,
described Kerviel as a &#8220;fraudster&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; the day
he announced the loss on Jan. 24, 2008. 
The disclosure came months before Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy and the revelation of the Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC Ponzi scheme. It also turned Kerviel
into a local hero, seen by 77 percent of France as a victim of
the system, according to a poll taken two weeks after the loss
was announced. 
Metzner has made a career mining case files and legal
technicalities to spring clients from jail and get companies and
executives out of trouble. 
While he speaks passionately of defending the underdog,
Metzner&#8217;s clients include a lot of big names. About 80 percent
of his practice is corporate. He&#8217;s on retainer for Bouygues SA,
France&#8217;s second-biggest construction company. And he defended
Houston-based Continental Airlines Inc. against manslaughter
charges after a French investigation concluded debris from a
Continental plane brought down the Concorde supersonic jet in
2000. A verdict in the four-month trial, which ended May 28, is
due in December. 
Metzner &#8220;can grasp things quickly, keep them all in mind,
and distill them,&#8221; said Carson Seeligson, head of Continental&#8217;s
Concorde crash legal team. &#8220;And he always keeps the bigger
picture in mind.&#8221;

Verdicts/Settlements 
Wells Fargo Wins Minnesota Verdict on Punitive Damages 
Wells Fargo  Co. won a jury decision yesterday rejecting
punitive damages above the $30.1 million awarded to four
Minnesota nonprofits that claimed the bank marketed a risky
securities-lending program it portrayed as safe. 
The nonprofits asked the jury to impose at least $100
million in punitive damages in the second phase of the trial
yesterday. Wells Fargo argued that no punitives were warranted
in the case. 
A state court jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, found Wells
Fargo liable for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of
Minnesota&#8217;s consumer fraud act on June 2. 
The Minnesota Workers&#8217; Compensation Reinsurance Association
and three charitable foundations sued in 2008, claiming the bank
failed to disclose the deteriorating value of the investments
until it was too late and blocked them from getting out of the
program. 
The case is Workers Compensation Reinsurance Association v.
Wells Fargo Bank, 62-cv-08-10825, District Court, Ramsey County,
Minnesota (St. Paul).

JPMorgan London Unit Gets Record Fine From U.K.&#8217;s FSA 
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s London unit was fined a record 33.3
million pounds ($48.8 million) by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator
for not properly separating client money from the firm&#8217;s
accounts. 
An average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t properly segregated by
JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that went undetected for
seven years, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement yesterday. As much as $23 billion of client money held
by the bank&#8217;s futures and options business wasn&#8217;t put in
separate overnight customer accounts between 2002 and 2009, the
FSA said. 
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, forced the FSA to
put financial companies on notice that they must properly
separate client funds. New York-based Lehman&#8217;s creditors filed
more than $830 billion of claims and regulators worldwide are
trying to unravel how money moved through its global units. 
&#8220;The FSA has repeatedly emphasized the importance of
ensuring that client money is adequately protected,&#8221; said
Margaret Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement director. &#8220;This penalty
sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must
ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.
Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action -- we have
several more cases in the pipeline.&#8221; 
Had the company gone bankrupt, clients could have lost all
their money because they would have been unsecured creditors
rather than having the right to claim back money from ring-
fenced accounts, according to the regulator. 
JPMorgan spokesman David Wells declined to comment. The New
York-based bank escaped a 47.6 million-pound fine by cooperating
with the regulator, according to the FSA&#8217;s statement. No clients
lost money, and the mistake didn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s financial
reporting, the FSA said. JPMorgan said in August that it may
have mixed 8.5 billion pounds of clients&#8217; money with its own
funds, and that it hired KPMG LLP to review its accounts.

Ex-NeuTec Executive, Two Lawyers Cleared in FSA Case 
NeuTec Pharma Ltd.&#8217;s former chief financial officer and two
lawyers were cleared of insider-trading charges yesterday by a
London court, handing the U.K. financial regulator its first
defeat in a criminal case. 
Andrew King, the former CFO of Novartis AG&#8217;s NeuTec unit,
and Michael McFall, a former mergers lawyer at McDermott Will 
Emery LLP were cleared by a London jury. The judge told the jury
to find Andrew Rimmington, another lawyer whose case was halted
last month after his brother was killed, not guilty after they
gave their verdicts on the other two men. 
Wallace said she was &#8220;delighted&#8221; with the verdict. 
&#8220;We always believed the FSA&#8217;s case against him was flawed
but Mr. King has faced a long fight to clear his name and he and
his family have faced years of worry,&#8221; Wallace, a partner at
Irwin Mitchell LLP in London, said in a statement. &#8220;Having
worked with them throughout this, we are very pleased that they
can now move on with their lives.&#8221; 
McFall declined to comment outside the courtroom. 
&#8220;Insider dealing cases are challenging to prove, but these
were serious charges and we considered that the evidence
provided a proper basis to put the case before a jury for them
to decide,&#8221; Margaret Cole, the FSA enforcement director, said
in a statement. &#8220;Criminal prosecutions are integral to the
FSA&#8217;s long-term strategy of delivering credible deterrence and
combating insider dealing.&#8221; 
Prosecutor Michael Bowes said during the trial that the two
lawyers made 39,000 pounds each ($57,000) in June 2006 after
King gave McFall an early warning about Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis&#8217;s plan to purchase NeuTec. McFall gave the information
to Rimmington, Bowes said.

Ladbrokes, Betfair Lose Dutch Betting-Ban EU Appeal 
Ladbrokes Plc, owner of more than 2,700 betting shops, and
Betfair Ltd. lost a European Union court challenge to Dutch
rules blocking them from opening their websites to gamblers in
the Netherlands. 
&#8220;This prohibition may, on account of the specific features
associated with the provision of games of chance on the
Internet, be regarded as justified by the objective of combating
fraud and crime,&#8221; the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
said yesterday in a ruling that applies to the EU&#8217;s 27 nations
and can&#8217;t be appealed. 
Ladbrokes and Betfair have been fighting in Dutch courts
for at least seven years seeking to overcome the government&#8217;s
refusal to grant them licenses or allow citizens access to their
services. Dutch courts handling the cases sought guidance from
the EU tribunal on the legality of the policy. 
At least 11 cases over challenges to German, Austrian and
Swedish gambling restrictions are pending at the EU court.
Germany and Sweden are among countries which have been
threatened by the European Commission to loosen some of their
restrictions and some recently started to do so. 
Ladbrokes said in an e-mailed statement it was
&#8220;confident&#8221; that the ruling will lead to a detailed assessment
in the Dutch courts. 
&#8220;The Ladbrokes and Betfair cases have clearly demonstrated
the fragility of the entire Dutch legal framework in relation to
gambling,&#8221; said John O&#8217;Reilly, a managing director at
Ladbrokes. 
Yesterday&#8217;s ruling &#8220;once again demonstrates the need for
the&#8221; commission &#8220;to take a lead on this issue, so that we can
separate fact from fiction and settle the online gambling debate
once and for all,&#8221; said Tim Phillips, a Betfair spokesman, in
an e-mailed statement. 
The cases are C-203/08 The Sporting Exchange Ltd, trading
under the name &#8216;Betfair&#8217; v. Minister for Justice, Stichting de
Nationale Sporttotalisator and Scientific Games Racing; C-258/08
Ladbrokes Betting  Gaming Ltd. and Ladbrokes International Ltd.
v. Stichting de Nationale Sporttotalisator.

New Suits 
Philip Morris, Reynolds Sue New York for Smoking Ads 
U.S. cigarette makers Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. sued New York, alleging the city&#8217;s mandated anti-
smoking ads violate their First Amendment rights and are
preempted by federally mandated warnings. 
The cigarette makers and Lorillard Tobacco Co. allege in a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
that the city&#8217;s graphic health-warning signs force them to carry
messages they wouldn&#8217;t carry at the point of sale. The signs
show cancerous lungs, a decayed tooth and a brain damaged by
stroke and bear the message &#8220;Quit Smoking Today.&#8221; 
The companies, joined by state retail associations, seek a
court order to stop New York from enforcing the law. The city
resolution, amended in September, requires that any business
selling tobacco &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; to consumers also prominently
display the tobacco health-warning signs. 
&#8220;Through words and imagery, the signs urge consumers not
to purchase plaintiffs&#8217; products,&#8221; the cigarette makers said.
&#8220;The mandated signs also restrict plaintiffs&#8217; ability to
communicate about lawful products with their adult customers.&#8221; 
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman with the city&#8217;s Law
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that her office is
reviewing the complaint. 
&#8220;However, while these proposed changes were under
consideration, we carefully considered all of the legal issues,
as well as comments we received from the public,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We are confident that the health code provisions being
challenged will withstand legal scrutiny.&#8221; 
The case is Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. New York City Board of
Health, 10-cv-4392, U.S. District Court (Manhattan). 
BanxCorp Sues Dow Jones, New York Times Over Rate Sites 
BanxCorp, operator of the BanxQuote website, sued media
companies including News Corp.&#8217;s Dow Jones  Co. and New York
Times Co., accusing them of forming a cartel to sell information
on bank interest rates on their websites. 
BanxCorp on June 2 added the companies, as well as AOL
Inc., to an antitrust lawsuit filed on May 14 against Tree.com
Inc.&#8217;s LendingTree LLC in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. 
The companies conspired with BanxQuote competitor Bankrate
Inc. to &#8220;gain an unfair advantage over the plaintiff&#8221; by
fixing the prices banks pay to have rates listed on websites,
according to the complaint. BanxCorp, based in Scarsdale, New
York, estimates damages at more than $500 million. 
Financial institutions pay to list their interest rates on
websites run by BanxCorp and Bankrate, then consumers use the
sites to find the most competitive rates for financial products
such as certificates of deposit and mortgages. The media
companies republish the data. 
The other defendants named are General Electric Co.&#8217;s CNBC,
Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Cable News Network, Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s and
GE&#8217;s MSNBC Interactive News LLC, News Corp.&#8217;s Fox News Network
and Move Inc. 
Jack Horner, a News Corp. spokesman; Sara Anissipour, an
outside spokeswoman for Microsoft; and Anne Eisele of GE, Alysia
Lew of AOL and Julie Reynolds of Move.com said their companies
had no comment. 
&#8220;We haven&#8217;t been served and haven&#8217;t seen the complaint,&#8221;
Diane McNulty, a New York Times spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
Mona Marimow of LendingTree and Christa Robinson of CNN didn&#8217;t
return messages for comment. 
BanxCorp also sued Bankrate in federal court in New Jersey.
That suit is pending, BanxCorp Chief Executive Officer Norbert
Mehl said in a telephone interview. 
The case is BanxCorp v. LendingTree LLC, 10-02467, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Miami Beach Hotel Developers Enter Not Guilty Pleas 
Two Miami Beach hotel developers pleaded not guilty
yesterday to charges of hiding more than $150 million in assets
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
were indicted May 25 on charges of conspiracy and filing false
tax returns. They face as long as 14 years in prison if
convicted. 
The pair is accused of using shell companies such as
American Leisure Resorts Inc. as part of a conspiracy to conceal
their ownership of a $45 million investment portfolio, $55
million in commercial properties in Miami Beach, homes in New
York and Florida, and cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a
Porsche Carrera GT and Ferrari Testarossa. They failed to pay
taxes on their assets, prosecutors said. 
The Cohens were arrested April 15 as part of a tax-day
sweep targeting offshore tax evasion. U.S. Magistrate Judge
Lurana Snow in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 20 ordered the
two men held without bail, saying they posed a flight risk. 
The Cohens developed high-end hotels under the name
Flatotel International. After selling the New York Flatotel in
2000, they used &#8220;numerous nominee and shell corporations&#8221; to
hide $33 million in proceeds from tax collectors, prosecutors
said in the indictment. 
The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).

Infineon Loses Bid to Dismiss Lawsuit in Canada Court 
Infineon Technologies AG and other computer memory
manufacturers lost a bid at Canada&#8217;s top court to throw out a
group lawsuit claiming they fixed prices and overcharged
customers between 1999 and 2002. 
The Supreme Court of Canada yesterday denied the
chipmakers&#8217; request for a hearing, upholding a British Columbia
Court of Appeal ruling that allowed the suit to proceed. 
Infineon, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Samsung Electronics
Co. were sued in British Columbia after having pleaded guilty in
the U.S. to criminal charges arising from an international
conspiracy to fix prices of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, computer chips. The companies weren&#8217;t charged in Canada
and haven&#8217;t paid any fines to regulators. 
Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd., a Richmond, British Columbia,
computer consulting company, sued Infineon, Hynix, Samsung and
Micron Technology Inc. on behalf of all buyers of the memory in
the province, claiming it paid more for the memory chips that it
should have because the companies fixed prices. They seek to
recover damages, including restitution for unjust enrichment and
an order for the companies to give up profits earned. 
The companies claimed a group, or class-action, suit was
improper because each customer would have to prove damages
individually. Supreme Court of British Columbia Judge David
Masuhara agreed with the companies and dismissed the suit. He
also ruled Pro-Sys wouldn&#8217;t fairly or adequately represent the
interests of the class. 
The Court of Appeal overturned the decision, unanimously
saying liability can be determined on a common basis &#8220;without
resort to individualized inquiries,&#8221; and a class suit was
preferable. 
The case is Infineon Technologies AG v. Pro-Sys Consultants
Ltd., 33522, Supreme Court of Canada (Ottawa).

Trials/Appeals 
JJ Misled Pennsylvania on Drug&#8217;s Risks, Lawyer Says 
A Johnson  Johnson unit misled Pennsylvania officials
about the health risks of its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug and
duped the state into paying $289 million more than it should
have for the medicine, a lawyer said. 
Pennsylvania officials wouldn&#8217;t have paid a premium for
Risperdal had they known it was no more effective than existing
anti-psychotic drugs and was found to cause diabetes, Fletch
Trammell, a lawyer for the state, told a Philadelphia jury
yesterday. Pennsylvania is seeking to recover $289 million it
paid for Risperdal prescriptions. 
&#8220;There were a dozen anti-psychotics that were just as good
as Risperdal and cost a fraction&#8221; as much, Trammell said in
opening statements in the trial of the state&#8217;s rebate lawsuit
against JJ. 
JJ&#8217;s lawyer contended in his opening statement that the
drugmaker did nothing wrong in marketing Risperdal to state-
sponsored health-care programs. 
&#8220;There is no merit in the case that&#8221; the state will
present, Thomas Campion, JJ&#8217;s lawyer, told jurors yesterday. 
&#8220;We have always been committed to ethical business
practices and we are fully prepared to defend ourselves against
these claims,&#8221; Greg Panico, a JJ spokesman, said in a written
statement.

Court News 
New Orleans Judge Sells Bonds to Avoid Spill Conflict 
A New Orleans federal judge said he sold his investments in
companies tied to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to avoid any
conflict of interest in presiding over lawsuits involving spill-
damage claims. 
&#8220;So there is no perception of a conflict in these cases,
yesterday I instructed my broker to sell the few Transocean and
Halliburton bonds in my account,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier said in an e-mail yesterday. 
BP Plc and Transocean Ltd. oil-spill lawsuits may be
combined before a judge from outside the Gulf Coast states,
because judges in the region are withdrawing from cases, citing
conflicts of interest. 
Six of 12 active judges assigned to the federal judicial
district based in New Orleans already have removed themselves
from spill-damage lawsuits, according to a court official and
public records. The judges found conflicts tied to oil
investments or personal relationships with lawyers or companies
involved. 
Several additional federal judges in districts based in
Lafayette, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida,
have also disqualified themselves from oil-spill cases,
according to public records. 
Barbier&#8217;s portfolio contained Transocean Sedco Forex notes
and Halliburton Co. debentures, according to financial
disclosure forms posted by Judicial Watch, a self-styled
conservative advocacy group based in Washington. 
More than 170 proposed class-action lawsuits, representing
potentially thousands of claims, have been filed in courthouses
from Texas to Florida. BP, the owner of the offshore lease, and
Transocean, the rig owner, are named in virtually all the cases.
Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which provided cementing
services to the well, and Cameron International Corp., which
supplied blowout prevention equipment, are also named in most of
the lawsuits. 
The case is In re Oil Spill By the Oil Rig &#8220;Deepwater
Horizon&#8221; in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, U.S. Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation, MDL-2179, Washington.

Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts
for Asian currencies, including the South Korean won and the
Indian rupee, as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis saps demand for the
region&#8217;s exports. 
The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the

eight-month low on May 25 as concern Europe&#8217;s funding woes will
slow a recovery wiped more than $4 trillion from the value of
global equities last month. The euro dropped to its lowest level
in four years against the dollar before the Group of 20 nations
gathers today in South Korea to discuss the currency&#8217;s decline. 
&#8220;A weak euro and fiscal drag in Euroland will impart
weaker external-demand conditions for Asian currencies ex-
Japan,&#8221; analysts Stewart Newnham and Yee Wai Chong wrote in a
report dated yesterday. &#8220;We are mindful that if China slows too,
this would further soften the regional currency outlook.&#8221; 
South Korea&#8217;s won will likely strengthen to 1,175 per
dollar by year-end, compared with an earlier forecast of 1,050,
the report said. The currency closed trading at 1,201.80 in
Seoul today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India&#8217;s
rupee may climb to 46 and the Singapore dollar to S$1.39. The
bank&#8217;s previous estimates were 43.50 and S$1.32. 
The rupee dropped 0.6 percent this week to 46.63 against
the dollar and the Singapore dollar lost 0.2 percent to S$1.40.
The won fell 0.6 percent. 
The Asia Dollar Index reached 108.77 on May 25, the lowest
level since Sept. 15. The euro touched $1.2111 on June 1, the
weakest since April 14, 2006. 
Tightening Delays 
Overseas shipments to Europe range from 9 percent to 27
percent of exports from Asian countries, with India sending 27
percent, China 23 percent and the Philippines 16 percent, the
report said. 
Asian currencies may become less attractive to investors as
central banks delay raising interest rates, Morgan Stanley said.
Asia, powered by China&#8217;s booming economy, has been leading the
global economic recovery, where countries including Malaysia and
India have increased borrowing costs. 
Central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines kept
interest rates at record lows yesterday and Thailand left
borrowing costs unchanged a day earlier, as policy makers judged
the European crisis to be a bigger risk to their economies than
inflation. 
China&#8217;s economic growth may slow to 9 percent in 2011 from
an estimate of 11 percent in 2010, according to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
report. 
&#8220;Asian currencies ex-Japan may also lose the support from
a monetary tightening bias,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said. 
Developing Asia will expand 8.7 percent in 2011, outpacing
global growth of 4.3 percent, according to estimates from the
International Monetary Fund on April 21.

Morgan Stanley plans to double its
private bankers in Asia over the next three years as Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman aims to boost profits from the
global wealth management unit that he&#8217;d previously helmed. 
The company plans to hire almost 100 bankers in the region
this year, Charles Mak, head of private wealth management for
Asia, said in an interview. It also appointed Nick Chan, an ex-
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who was running New York-based
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Indonesian private bank, to a newly-created
recruiting and staff development role for Mak&#8217;s group this year. 
&#8220;This will be our most aggressive expansion in the private
wealth space in Asia,&#8221; Mak said by telephone from Hong Kong.
&#8220;This region has the best economic growth, the highest levels
of wealth creation, and many players are coming to this part of
the world, or are expanding.&#8221; 
The bank is competing with rivals including UBS AG,
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd.
to hire financial advisers in a market with an estimated $7.4
trillion of private riches. Growth in the region&#8217;s wealth will
outstrip the global average as its economies outperform,
Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management said in October. 
Morgan Stanley provides services for the so-called ultra-
high net worth segment in Asia, aiming at clients who have at
least $10 million in wealth. In India and Australia, it also
targets people starting with $1 million or more. 
Global Operations 
Separately today, Morgan Stanley said its Asia chairman
Stephen Roach will relocate to New York from Hong Kong and
become its non-executive chairman for Asia. The move will take
effect on July 1. 
Pretax profit for Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global-wealth management
unit more than doubled to $278 million for the first quarter.
The company paid $2.75 billion in cash in June 2009 to create
the world&#8217;s largest brokerage by gaining control of Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney and the biggest U.S. team of financial
advisers. 
Gorman, who led the brokerage before succeeding John Mack
at the helm of Morgan Stanley in January, said in a letter to
shareholders in April that the joint venture will play &#8220;an
increasingly important role in our growth and profitability.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney President Charles Johnston has
said the venture will look to expand outside the U.S. because
those markets are set to grow faster. The unit employed about
18,140 advisers globally and managed client assets of about $1.6
trillion at the end of the quarter, Morgan Stanley said April 21. 
Chan, 39, will relocate to Hong Kong from Singapore next
week. He joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 with three of his five-
member team from Goldman Sachs. He had previously overseen the
private banking business in Indonesia from Singapore for Goldman
Sachs, after starting his career in investment banking with
Smith Barney Asia Inc. in 1994 in Hong Kong.

An experimental pill from Pfizer Inc.
shrank tumors in patients with a rare form of lung cancer that
is caused by a defective gene and occurs mostly in nonsmokers, a
study showed. 
The medicine, crizotinib, reduced tumor size in 57 percent
of patients and stopped the progression of the disease in 87
percent of those in a study released today at the meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Most of the
trial&#8217;s participants never smoked or were former smokers. 
Pfizer&#8217;s drug is the only compound in human testing to
target a defect in a gene called ALK, which can turn deadly when
a piece of it breaks away and fuses with a neighboring gene,
causing cells to grow out of control, said Alice Shaw, a
thoracic cancer specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. The gene flaw occurs in about 5 percent of lung cancer
patients. If effective in larger studies, the drug could be
available in 2013 and generate annual sales of $800 million,
said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler, in a note to clients. 
&#8220;The drug has shown remarkable activity against tumors,&#8221;
said Shaw, one of the study&#8217;s researchers. &#8220;As a lung cancer
doctor, you just don&#8217;t see changes like this in patients.&#8221; 
Crizotinib is among 24 new tumor-fighting medicines that
New York-based Pfizer is developing to help offset the $11
billion in revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies of its cholesterol pill Lipitor enter the market. 
Countering Setbacks 
Investor confidence in Pfizer&#8217;s ability to replace that
revenue with new medicines has waned following some research
failures this year, said Trevor Polischuk, an analyst with
OrbiMed Advisors LLC in New York. Data on crizotinib and at
least four other experimental drugs that Pfizer will report on
at the cancer meeting may help to restore some of that
confidence, he said. 
&#8220;What ASCO can do is remind people that there is a
pipeline there and opportunity there,&#8221; Polischuk said in a
telephone interview. 
In March, the company said its experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s drug
Dimedon, which analysts said could have generated $5 billion in
annual sales, failed to help patients in a late-stage study.
That same month, the company said Sutent, approved for kidney
and stomach cancers, failed in two studies to shrink tumors of
the breast, and its experimental drug figitumumab didn&#8217;t help
lung cancer patients. 
The results released today on crizotinib are from the
second of three stages of study required to get U.S. regulatory
clearance. More than 100 patients have been treated with the
drug and Pfizer has evaluated 82 patients for a response. The
drug has now advanced into final testing and the company plans
to seek U.S. approval for crizotinib in the first half of 2011,
Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said. 
Cancer Killer 
Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn&#8217;t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. About 15 percent of lung cancer cases worldwide occur
in patients with no history of smoking. 
The defective gene that crizotinib is designed to thwart
occurs in about 6,000 cancer patients a year in the U.S., said
Shaw. It is believed to be most common in people who have never
smoked and are middle-age, she said. 
One such patient, Linnea Duff, an artist who lives in New
Hampshire, was among the first to receive the experimental pill.
At age 45, Duff, who had never smoked, was diagnosed with lung
cancer and given a 15 percent chance of living five years.
Available treatments failed to help her and she was preparing to
die when given her first dose of the drug in September 2008. 
&#8216;Blew Everyone Away&#8217; 
A few days later she noticed her cough went away and she
was no longer out of breath. Seven weeks later, a scan showed
that her lung tumor, which had marched through every other
treatment, had disappeared. The results &#8220;blew everyone away,&#8221;
she said. 
&#8220;Before this drug, it was definitely the end of my life. I
was seeing a psychiatrist at the hospital to try to deal with
this and try to prepare,&#8221; Duff recalls. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve returned to
that state of mind where I think about the future again. I&#8217;ve
gotten back into the habit of making plans and in September I&#8217;m
going to Sweden with my oldest son.&#8221; 
The early research that led to the development of
crizotinib was started by Sugen Inc., a Redwood City,
California-based biotechnology company that also discovered the
kidney cancer treatment Sutent. Sugen was acquired by Pharmacia
 Upjohn Inc. in 1999 for $650 million and Pfizer acquired
Pharmacia in 2003 for $58 billion. Pfizer researchers in La
Jolla, California then picked up the research and developed the
compound used in today&#8217;s study. 
Blocking Cell Signals 
When Pfizer first started developing crizotinib, they knew
it could block the signals from the defective ALK gene and a
protein called c-MET, and they believed it could help patients
with lymphoma and sarcoma. What they didn&#8217;t know was that it
could also be a potential treatment for lung cancer patients.
Then, in August 2007 a study by Japanese researchers found the
defect in a lung cancer patient. 
That discovery sent Shaw and her team of researchers
scrambling to find lung cancer patients to add to the study and
four months later they started testing the drug in lung cancer.
Duff was one of those that Shaw initially recruited. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, has been throwing
its weight behind cancer research since 2008 hoping to grab a
larger share of the $53 billion market for cancer drugs. The
company created a division focused on discovering and selling
medicine for cancer in 2008 and spends about a quarter of its $8
billion research budget on cancer research. 
Other Research 
Pfizer also released data today from a separate study that
found patients taking a lung cancer treatment called PF-299
lived a month longer without their disease worsening than those
taking Roche Holding AG&#8217;s Tarceva. The study followed 188
patients for an average of 12 weeks and was part of the second
of three stages of testing required to get FDA approval.
Patients taking Pfizer&#8217;s drug were more likely to have diarrhea,
acne or a rash. 
On June 7, Pfizer will present data at the cancer meeting
showing that leukemia patients who failed to benefit from or
were unable to tolerate Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG&#8217;s
Gleevec responded to its experimental treatment bosutinib. The
drug is being studied in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
and is now in the final stages of testing. 
Pfizer has been trying to take a more targeted approach to
its cancer research by matching its drugs to a specific tumor&#8217;s
traits. In the case of crizotinib, Pfizer has partnered with
rival drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, based in Abbott Park,
Illinois, to develop a test to detect which patients have the
gene flaw that the drug targets. 
&#8216;Biological Insights&#8217; 
&#8220;We are trying to bring more focus to drug development
based on genetic and biological insights from the cancer,&#8221; said
Mace Rothenberg, Pfizer&#8217;s vice president of clinical affairs for
cancer. &#8220;This is what patients will value because the goal will
be to deliver drugs to patients who are most likely to benefit
and patients won&#8217;t be exposed to potentially toxic drugs
unnecessarily.&#8221; 
Researchers for the past decade have been trying to figure
out why certain treatments work in some patients and not in
others. For instance, Tarceva from Basel, Switzerland-based
Roche Holding AG and Iressa from London-based AstraZeneca Plc
work best in patients with a certain mutation called EGFR that
occurs in about 10 percent of lung cancer cases. 
&#8220;Ten years ago, no matter what the type of tumor, patients
were all getting chemo,&#8221; said Mark Kris, a lung cancer
specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. &#8220;Science now tells us that that isn&#8217;t the way it should
be. Just like we are all individuals, cancer is individual too
and we need to treat the cancer in that person.&#8221; 
Not a Cure 
Crizotinib isn&#8217;t a cure for most patients as tumors are
expected to eventually develop a resistance to the treatment,
said Shaw. After 19 months on the pill, Duff says that her
cancer is now back. She is still taking the drug in hopes it
will slow progression enough for her to be able to get into a
trial for a similar-acting drug. 
The side effects from the drug are mild and less than seen
with other cancer therapies, said Rothenberg. The most common
side effects are loss of appetite and in some cases patients&#8217;
night vision is distorted, according to the study. 
The current treatments for lung cancer include surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation and targeted drug therapies, led by
Roche&#8217;s Avastin and Tarceva.

Doctors treating brain cancer have a
limited toolkit. They can cut tumors out with a knife, burn them
with radiation or try to poison them with drugs. 
NovoCure Ltd., a closely held Israeli company, has added a
fourth option for hard-to-treat tumors. It&#8217;s an array of
electrodes resembling a tight-fitting helmet that bathes the
cancer in a faint electric field, scrambling the inner workings
of the rampaging cells and preventing them from multiplying. 
The helmet, powered by a 6-pound battery pack, is designed
to zap deadly glioblastomas, the malignancy that killed U.S.
Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009. In a study reported today,
it helped patients with recurrent tumors live 7.8 months,
compared with a median 6.1 months for patients given the best
available chemotherapies or Roche AG&#8217;s Avastin. 
The technology is so different from other treatments, it
was difficult to convince patients and doctors to try it, said
Philip Gutin, primary investigator for the study. &#8220;This new
data actually shows that it&#8217;s effective,&#8221; said Gutin, the chair
of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. &#8220;People will ask for this now.&#8221; 
The electric fields resonate at a frequency designed to do
no harm to healthy brain tissue. In the test, the only side
effect was mild scalp irritation, Gutin said. &#8220;If it continues
to look as good as it does, it will be used in lots of different
treatments. There&#8217;s no downside to it.&#8221; 
The study, reported at the American Society of Clinical
Oncology in Chicago, followed 237 very sick patients whose
cancers had returned after prior treatment and whose tumors, on
average, were 4 centimeters (1.57 inches) in diameter. 
Topping Chemotherapy 
The study was designed to show that patients using the
helmet fared significantly better than those taking chemotherapy
and Avastin. On this basis, it was a failure. That&#8217;s because
more than 50 patients either died or dropped out before they
completed the first round of treatment, said Eilon Kirson, head
of NovoCure&#8217;s research and development. 
When those patients are excluded from both arms of the
analysis, the helmet performed better than other treatments,
Kirson said. Under either analysis, the trial found the helmet
to be at least as good as other approaches, but without the
vomiting, fatigue and infections associated with chemotherapy. 
While shooting electricity through the brain conjures
images of Mary Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Frankenstein,&#8221; or the involuntary
electroshock therapy in Ken Kesey&#8217;s &#8220;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#8217;s
Nest,&#8221; Kirson emphasized that NovoCure&#8217;s technology is new. The
helmet is the first cancer therapy to use alternating polarities
in electric fields as a way to disrupt the cell division process
known as mitosis. 
&#8220;Bad Name&#8221; 
&#8220;Electricity has gotten a bad name in medicine in the last
century or two,&#8221; Kirson said in a telephone interview. &#8220;People
hear &#8216;electric fields&#8217; and of course they are skeptical. In
order to cross that barrier into biology and medicine, we had to
start at the end. The end is glioblastoma.&#8221; 
NovoCure, based in Haifa, was started by Yoram Palti, a
professor of electrophysiology and biophysics at Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology. Early funding came from Bill Doyle,
founder of investment firm WFD Ventures and now chairman of
NovoCure. Pfizer Inc. and Johnson  Johnson are also investors,
according to a NovoCure statement. 
Early prototypes were cumbersome for patients, weighing
about 15 pounds, Kirson said. The current battery pack looks
like a white laptop computer that slips into a shoulder bag, and
the company plans to shrink the device further. 
Patients wore NovoCure&#8217;s helmet for about 20 hours a day,
shaving their heads twice weekly before reapplying the electrode
patches. The patients were able to conduct most of their usual
routine with the machine and took occasional breaks for athletic
or social events. 
&#8220;A Nice Shower&#8221; 
&#8220;We have a patient who plays tennis,&#8221; Kirson said.
&#8220;Whenever she replaces her electrodes, she goes and plays
tennis for a couple of hours, she has a nice shower, she goes
into the sauna, and when she gets out she&#8217;ll put it back on and
keep going.&#8221; Now NovoCure is testing the helmet simultaneously
with chemotherapy in early cases of glioblastoma with hope that
a combination will enhance the effectiveness of both treatments. 
NovoCure is using today&#8217;s trial to apply for U.S. marketing
approval, and the company seeks to begin U.S. sales next year,
Kirson said. The helmet is already approved for use in Europe,
though health plans there won&#8217;t currently pay the $10,000 to
$15,000 a month it costs to wear it. 
NovoCure is testing similar devices for other types of
hard-to-treat cancer. The results of a test in 42 lung cancer
patients will likely be released at the European Society of
Medical Oncology meeting in September, Kirson said. 
&#8220;I must admit that when I first saw this I thought it was
complete and utter trash -- I&#8217;m being that honest about it,&#8221;
Kirson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a novel technology, you have to show
that you are the real thing. The real reason I went into this
was because I had worked with Professor Palti, and I believed in
him. I thought he was a brilliant man, and I still do.&#8221;

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
subpoenaed by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission after
panel members said the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history engaged in a document &#8220;dump&#8221; to hinder a probe. 
Goldman Sachs sent more than a billion pages of documents,
FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas said on a conference call with
reporters today. Not all of the information is what the panel
requested, and Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t cooperate with requests to
interview Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides said. 
&#8220;We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish,&#8221; said Angelides, 56, who
previously served as California&#8217;s treasurer. &#8220;This has been a
very deliberate effort over time to run out the clock.&#8221; 
The FCIC, which Congress appointed last year to investigate
the causes of the worst economic slump since the Great
Depression, issued the subpoena June 4. The request adds to
government scrutiny of New York-based Goldman Sachs, as
regulators and lawmakers examine how it packaged mortgages into
securities that fueled investor losses when the housing market
collapsed in 2007.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is being
&#8220;legitimately scrutinized&#8221; by regulators who sued the firm for
fraud based on conduct that many in the industry consider to be
common practice, according to a Bloomberg survey. 
The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
has suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to the global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. Eighty-
three percent of respondents said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stature
diminished in the past six months; the next closest were UBS AG,
with 27 percent, and Citigroup Inc., at 26 percent. 
&#8220;This disaster didn&#8217;t occur by mistake,&#8221; said respondent
Dane Fulmer, who has traded fixed-income financial instruments
for 39 years and runs Dane Fulmer Investments in Fort Smith,
Arkansas. &#8220;If it was an honest mistake, then it far, far
surpasses what the law would consider negligent.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which said the New York-based company
failed to inform investors about the role hedge fund Paulson 
Co. played in both helping to select contracts underlying a
mortgage-linked investment and betting against it. Goldman Sachs
has said it did nothing wrong and is fighting the case. 
Asked for their opinion of the SEC fraud suit, 61 percent
of respondents replied that the firm &#8220;is being legitimately
scrutinized,&#8221; while 29 percent answered that the company &#8220;is
being unfairly vilified.&#8221; The remainder were undecided. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the poll. 
Views of Goldman Sachs and its outlook were more negative
outside the U.S., where 69 percent of respondents found the SEC
suit to be reasonable, compared with 48 percent of people polled
in the U.S. 
Common Practice 
About three-quarters of the people in all regions who said
they thought the SEC&#8217;s case was justifiable also said the
alleged behavior is common practice. 
&#8220;Complex transactions that may appear to some to be
malicious likely occur at every large investment house on the
Street,&#8221; said respondent Eric McCarthy, an analyst at a U.S.
hedge fund. 
Leverage derived from packaging subprime mortgage debt into
collateralized debt obligations and related derivatives, such as
the transaction at the center of the SEC&#8217;s suit against Goldman
Sachs, magnified losses in the mortgage market and contributed
to the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008. The crisis
led to an unprecedented taxpayer-funded bailout of banks,
including Goldman Sachs, which repaid its $10 billion capital
injection, with interest, last year. 
Clients Second 
Gala Prada, a fund manager at Fiatc Mutua de Seguros y
Reaseguros in Barcelona, an insurer with 1 billion euros ($1.2
billion) in assets, agreed that Goldman&#8217;s conduct wasn&#8217;t
unusual. 
&#8220;Investment banks, not only Goldman, first do their own
proper account trades and only then advise their clients to do
whatever is in their best interest, and I mean in the investment
bank&#8217;s interest,&#8221; Prada said. 
The outlook for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock and management was
more optimistic in the U.S., where more than half of those
polled said Lloyd Blankfein would remain chairman, compared with
36 percent of non-U.S. respondents who said so. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re a Goldman shareholder or a Goldman employee, by
and large you have been well served by the management team
relative to the environment and relative to the competition,&#8221;
said Brenden Smith, founder and principal of San Francisco-based
Cypress Capital Management LP and a former Goldman Sachs
employee. 
$13.4 Billion Profit 
Goldman set a profit record for a stand-alone U.S.
securities firm in 2007, when it earned $11.6 billion. In 2009,
after converting to a bank holding company, the firm topped its
previous record with $13.4 billion in profit. 
Three-quarters of respondents said they believe that
Goldman Sachs will settle the charges, with a plurality of 40
percent saying the issue would then dissipate, compared with 34
percent who said the damage to the firm would be lasting. About
34 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they thought the bad
publicity would blow over after the firm settles the suit. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a real break between perceptions inside the U.S.
and outside the U.S.,&#8221; said J. Ann Selzer, president of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Selzer  Co., which conducted the survey.
&#8220;If you just look at the U.S. customers, they see these current
troubles as temporary and predict the firm will exit standing
tall.&#8221; 
Blankfein&#8217;s Future 
The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders
and analysts in six continents was conducted June 2-3. It is
based on interviews with a random sample of 1,001 Bloomberg
subscribers, representing decision makers in markets, finance
and economics. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.1 percentage points. 
While 36 percent of non-U.S. respondents said they expect
Blankfein to remain as chairman, half of those polled said they
didn&#8217;t expect any major changes to the firm&#8217;s leadership as a
result of the lawsuit. A bigger proportion of U.S. subscribers,
59 percent, didn&#8217;t expect major changes, compared with 44
percent of people outside the U.S. 
Still, Blankfein was viewed unfavorably by 56 percent of
poll respondents, second only to BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward&#8217;s 65
percent among a list of 10 public figures that included
President Barack Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Goldman&#8217;s stock, which ended New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday at $138.68, has fallen 25 percent
since the suit was filed, and 41 percent of the people surveyed
said they are &#8220;generally bullish&#8221; on the shares. Forty percent
said they&#8217;re &#8220;generally bearish.&#8221; Fifty-four percent of U.S.
investors were bullish, compared with 28 percent in Europe and
43 percent in Asia. 
&#8216;Money Machine&#8217; 
&#8220;I&#8217;m bullish on it, I actually bought it,&#8221; said
respondent Carey Chapman, treasurer of the Asheboro, North
Carolina-based bank CommunityOne, part of FNB United Corp.
&#8220;They&#8217;re just a money machine, they know how to make money.&#8221; 
Much of the criticism is politically motivated, he added. 
&#8220;The Obama administration is trying to build a case
against Wall Street to push the financial legislation,&#8221; Chapman
said. 
Fallout Modest 
Yesterday, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a panel
appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the economic
slump, said it subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the firm didn&#8217;t
follow its requests, deliberately producing so many documents
that investigators cannot quickly sort them. 
Goldman said it is &#8220;committed to providing the FCIC with
the information they have requested.&#8221; That inquiry is separate
from the SEC&#8217;s case. 
Spain&#8217;s Prada said the fallout from the SEC lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs would be modest. 
&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s going to be business as
usual,&#8221; Prada said.

Coca-Cola Co. will pay $715 million
for the rights to distribute some Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.
brands, in a new agreement prompted by the acquisition of its
largest bottler. 
The cash payment will allow Coca-Cola to sell brands
including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry in some regions of the U.S.
and Canada for 20 years, the Atlanta-based company said today in
a statement. Dr Pepper also takes back the distribution of some
brands. 
Dr Pepper renegotiated its distribution contracts with
Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest soda maker, and PepsiCo Inc.
after both companies agreed to buy bottlers. PepsiCo paid $900
million this year to distribute some Dr Pepper drinks. The Coca-
Cola payment announced today is close to an estimate by Carlos Laboy, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. 
&#8220;The terms and cash amount are in-line with the previous
deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a
higher payment to come from Coke,&#8221; Laboy said today in a note.
He has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on Dr Pepper stock and
doesn&#8217;t rate Coca-Cola. 
Dr Pepper, based in Plano, Texas, fell 64 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $35.85 at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Coca-Cola dropped 47 cents to $50.80. 
Coca-Cola agreed to buy Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North
American bottling unit in February. The distribution deal will
replace those between Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola Enterprises when
the acquisition closes later this year, Coca-Cola said. 
Freestyle Fountain 
The payment is lower than the $900 million estimated by
Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst with UBS AG in New York. The
difference will be made up largely by Coca-Cola&#8217;s agreement to
give Dr Pepper access to fountain drink accounts and put Dr
Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its new Freestyle fountain,
Gajrawala said today in a note. He recommends buying Dr Pepper
and Coca-Cola shares. 
Dr Pepper, in a statement, valued the Freestyle access at
$115 million to $135 million. 
The Freestyle, a touch screen-controlled drink dispenser
that expands offerings to more than 100, will be available in at
least 500 U.S. outlets this summer, Coca-Cola said. 
Dr Pepper said it will take back distribution of Squirt,
Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler sold by Coca-Cola
Enterprises in certain U.S. territories. 
The agreement imposes new performance conditions on Coca-
Cola, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a call with
reporters, declining to provide further details. Fayard also
declined to say whether the new agreement includes a change-in-
control clause that would trigger a renegotiation should Coca-
Cola spin off the bottling operations. 
Coca-Cola bottlers distribute about 42 percent of the Dr
Pepper brand&#8217;s volume while PepsiCo distributes 39 percent,
Fayard said, citing statistics by industry newsletter Beverage
Digest.

Morgan Stanley slashed its forecasts
for Venezuela&#8217;s economy, saying it may contract this year and
next as higher oil prices fail to stimulate business and a
tightening of controls restricts access to foreign currency. 
Morgan Stanley now forecasts gross domestic product will
shrink 6.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2011, compared
with an earlier prediction for 0.3 percent growth this year and
3.5 percent expansion next year. 
&#8220;While most of Latin America, in line with the globe, has
been in recovery mode since last year, Venezuela has seen an
intensifying downturn in activity,&#8221; Daniel Volberg and Giuliana
Pardelli said in a report today. &#8220;Our new baseline of at least
three years of economic contraction suggests the risks to
Venezuela&#8217;s ability to honor its international financial
commitments may be on the rise.&#8221; 
Venezuela&#8217;s economy contracted 3.3 percent last year as
investment dried up following nationalizations and oil revenue
plunged on waning output and production cuts in line with OPEC
quotas. Morgan Stanley, based in New York, expects investment to
plunge 28.1 percent this year while private consumption drops
5.8 percent. 
President Hugo Chavez on May 18 closed the unregulated
currency market that companies used to buy dollars and ordered
the central bank to oversee the trading of dollar-denominated
securities that will be used to obtain currency at a government-
set exchange rate. 
Bolivar Devaluation 
Chavez devalued the bolivar as much as 50 percent on Jan. 8
to close a budget deficit and to slow capital flight, creating a
multi-tiered exchange system. 
The government&#8217;s Foreign Exchange Board pared dollar sales
at the official rates of 2.6 and 4.3 per dollar last year and
during the first three months of 2010, causing imports to
plummet 38 percent in the first quarter. 
While Venezuela may be successful in slowing capital flight
through the new currency market, imports will likely continue to
fall, Volberg and Pardelli said. 
&#8220;Given that imports have been essential in offsetting the
multi-year deterioration in domestic supply in Venezuela, the
restrictions may prove a significant negative supply shock for
the Venezuelan economy,&#8221; the analysts said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$716.3 million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages,
according to a person familiar with the offering. 
The transaction, which is the second of newly issued
commercial-mortgage backed bonds to be sold this year, consists
of 36 loans on 96 properties, said the person, who declined to
be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. 
Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7
million of the bonds in April. During the boom, sales grew as
large as $7.6 billion, the data show. 
Plunging property values have made it difficult for
borrowers to secure enough financing to retire maturing debt,
with prices down 42 percent from October 2007 peaks, according
to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. A record 7.02 percent of borrowers
are behind on payments, versus 1.87 percent a year ago,
according to Moody&#8217;s. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s offering consists of loans equal to 61.5 percent
of the value of the properties on average, the person said. In
2007, borrowers were able to take out loans equaling about 69.1
percent of a property&#8217;s value, according to Jefferies Group Inc.
data. 
Spreads to Treasuries 
The current ratio &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem all that much lower, but
the difference is today&#8217;s valuations,&#8221; said Lisa Pendergast, an
analyst at Jefferies in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;Property values
are no longer being driven by overly optimistic expectations on
cash flow and cheap and plentiful sources of capital.&#8221; 
Top-rated commercial-mortgage backed securities yield about
3.09 percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 8.03
percentage points over the benchmark a year ago, according to
Barclays PLC data. Lower spreads mean banks can offer more
attractive financing to borrowers. 
The largest top-rated portion of the RBS offering priced to
yield 0.9 percentage points more than the benchmark swap rate as
tighter underwriting standards give investors more confidence in
the mortgages being bundled into securities being sold now
compared with those written in 2007.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was attacked
by the state-controlled China Youth Daily as a &#8220;black hand&#8221;
that plays &#8220;tricks carefully designed to gamble with Chinese
enterprises,&#8221; the Financial Times reported. 
The Chinese newspaper&#8217;s article, which alleged that Goldman
may have &#8220;created even bigger losses for Chinese companies and
investors than it did with its fraudulent actions in the U.S.,&#8221;
was distributed through the Xinhua News and People&#8217;s Daily
websites, the FT said. 
China Youth Daily said Goldman has made an excessive amount
of money from underwriting initial public offerings, arranging
transactions and making its own private-equity investments,
according to the FT. 
The U.S. investment bank was also criticized for devising
and selling oil-hedging contracts to Chinese state companies,
which consequently suffered losses when oil prices fell, the FT
added.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, plans to sell $1.15 billion of convertible
senior notes due in 2013 and will use the proceeds to repay
short-term debt. 
Microsoft may grant underwriters an option to buy an
additional $100 million of the notes, the Redmond, Washington-
based company said today in a statement. The debt received
ratings of Aaa from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and AAA from
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
The proceeds will let Microsoft retire some of its
commercial paper. As of March 31, it had $2.25 billion of short-
term debt outstanding, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes give Microsoft
more stability with debt at a fixed rate, compared with the more
volatile interest of short-term paper. Convertible notes allow
investors to exchange debt into common stock at a pre-
established rate under specified conditions. 
&#8220;The commercial paper market in the last few years has
done some backflips no one would have expected, at times
freezing or seizing up entirely,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who
oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares, as
chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. 
Microsoft&#8217;s action indicates the company believes the
convertible market is an attractive place to sell now. &#8220;If I
owned some convertibles now, I&#8217;d be looking to sell them,&#8221; he
said. 
Microsoft issued $3.75 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year debt
in May 2009 as it tapped the corporate bond market for the first
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The company&#8217;s $2 billion of 2.95 percent notes maturing in
2014 traded at 103.936 cents on the dollar to yield 1.916
percent at 11:01 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. 
Microsoft fell 18 cents to $25.11 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia&#8217;s
largest mobile-phone company, swung to profit in the first
quarter as the country&#8217;s economy rebounded from its steepest
decline on record. 
Net income was $381 million, compared with net loss of
$53.5 million in the same period last year, MTS said in a
statement today. Sales gained 23 percent to $2.61 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Shamolin said the increase
was led by new customers and services, including in data
transmission. MTS&#8217;s &#8220;strong competing position&#8221; is allowing
the company to &#8220;take advantage of the economic growth.&#8221; 
Russia&#8217;s economy rebounded in the first quarter, growing
2.9 percent after shrinking 7.9 percent in 2009, the biggest
annual contraction on record. The ruble was 15 percent higher
against the dollar at the end of the period than it was a year
earlier, making it cheaper for companies with revenue in the
Russian currency to repay debt denominated in the greenback. 
MTS, based in Moscow, said operating income before
depreciation and amortization, or Oibda, advanced 20 percent,
less than sales, to $1.15 billion. Oibda margin, a measure of
profitability, narrowed to 44.1 percent from 45.1 percent.

Australian hedge fund Basis Capital
sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for $1 billion in a Manhattan
court, claiming it was forced into insolvency after buying
mortgage-linked securities that the New York-based firm created
and one of its executives termed &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
The lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund was
filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
sale of the &#8220;now notorious Timberwolf collateralized debt
obligation,&#8221; Basis said in a statement. 
&#8220;Goldman was pressuring investors to take the risk of
toxic securities off its books with knowingly false sales
pitches,&#8221; Eric Lewis, the lawyer for Basis Capital, said in the
statement. &#8220;Goldman should be called to account.&#8221; 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16, alleging fraud tied to a CDO known as Abacus
2007-AC1. Later that month, U.S. Senate lawmakers released
internal Goldman Sachs e-mails in which Thomas K. Montag, former
head of sales and trading in the Americas at Goldman Sachs,
called the Timberwolf Ltd. CDO &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
In its securities-fraud complaint, Basis said that this e-
mail was sent in the same week that it was closing its deal with
Goldman Sachs to purchase exposure to Timberwolf through credit
default swaps. The company asked for more than $1 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages. 
&#8216;Misguided Attempt&#8217; 
&#8220;The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; the investment
bank said today in a statement. 
Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, said in
its complaint that Goldman Sachs falsely claimed in June 2007
that the market for securities such as Timberwolf had stabilized
and that the investment was a &#8220;good entry point.&#8221; 
&#8220;All of these representations were knowingly false,&#8221;
Basis said in its statement. 
Within 2 1/2 weeks of its investment in the Timberwolf CDO,
Goldman Sachs began &#8220;to make significant margin calls&#8221; on
Basis and forced the firm into insolvency, Basis said. 
Timberwolf held pieces of other CDOs, according to a
statement from the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations in April. Timberwolf also included optimistic
side-bets on the performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the
firm took the opposite pessimistic side in &#8220;many&#8221; cases, the
panel said. 
Senator&#8217;s Comments 
The CDO was among the securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the New York-based firm needed to reduce
its mortgage holdings, said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan
Democrat. 
Goldman Sachs denied it cheated Basis. 
&#8220;At the time of the Timberwolf transaction, Basis
specifically stated that it would not place any reliance on
Goldman Sachs, and this decision formed part of the agreement
Basis signed,&#8221; the bank said in its statement. 
Basis made its investment at market levels that &#8220;were
substantially below the face value of the securities and
consistent with where other investors were purchasing the same
Timberwolf securities during the same time,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. 
Goldman Sachs lost several hundred millions of dollars of
its money from its exposure to Timberwolf, according to its
statement. 
The Yield Alpha Fund, formerly Basis Capital&#8217;s second
biggest, filed for bankruptcy protection in the Cayman Islands
in August 2007 after banks cut the value of its investments in
collateralized debt obligations, triggering margin calls the
fund was unable to meet. That came a month after investors in
two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds were told there was no value
left, wiping out the $1.6 billion initially invested. 
The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, raised $1.15 billion of interest-free financing
from its first sale of convertible bonds. 
The senior notes, which don&#8217;t pay a coupon and will be
redeemed at face value, can be handed over for shares when
Microsoft stock rises to about $33.40, a 33 percent increase
from June 8, according to a statement. The bonds, which Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft may redeem in cash, stock or both,
can&#8217;t be converted until March 2013 except in &#8220;certain
circumstances,&#8221; and they mature in June that year. 
Microsoft is the only issuer of convertible bonds with a
top rating from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s,
allowing it to benefit from investors seeking to boost the
average credit rankings of their funds. Convertible bonds are
typically sold by companies that are unrated or graded below
BBB-, the lowest investment grade, by SP and Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s. 
&#8220;Really, with the zero coupon this didn&#8217;t look that
attractive to us,&#8221; said Anja Eijking, who manages the
equivalent of about $2 billion in global equity-linked
securities at FC Netherlands BV in Amsterdam and didn&#8217;t order
the bonds. &#8220;You&#8217;d need a strong view on the stock appreciating.
Basically, this is cheap financing for the issuer.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. is shuttering five
ESPN Zone restaurants, saying the economics of the business
became too challenging. 
Locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and
Washington will close June 16, ESPN said today in an e-mailed
statement. The cable sports network is controlled by Burbank,
California-based Disney, 
ESPN Zone is a sports-themed restaurant chain started 12
years ago by Disney. It will stay open in Los Angeles and
Anaheim, California, where the restaurants are run by Anschutz
Entertainment Group and Zone Enterprises, ESPN said. 
&#8220;This was a very difficult decision to make&#8221; Rick
Alessandri, senior vice president at the cable sports network,
said in an interview. &#8220;But it was the right decision to make.&#8221;
It comes as Disney is opening a new retail store in New York&#8217;s
Times Square. 
Each restaurant was split into three sections, according to
Disney regulatory filings: a &#8220;studio grill&#8221; for dining, a
&#8220;screening room&#8221; for watching ESPN sports coverage and a
&#8220;sports arena&#8221; for playing interactive games. 
The restaurants averaged about 30,000 square feet, large by
industry standards, Alessandri said. The 50,000-square-foot
location in Times Square was the biggest, and the restaurant in
Baltimore was the chain&#8217;s first, he said. 
ESPN wouldn&#8217;t release revenue or other financial
information about the chain. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained 22 cents
to $33.37 at 2:12 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, the shares had climbed 2.8 percent this
year.

Morgan Stanley hired Michael V. Johnson, a Deutsche Bank AG investment banker, to advise oil and
gas exploration and production companies, a person briefed on
the plans said. 
Johnson will join as a managing director in the energy
investment-banking group this year, said the person, who spoke
on condition of anonymity because Johnson hasn&#8217;t started yet.
Deutsche Bank spokesman John Gallagher confirmed the departure.
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney said she couldn&#8217;t

Johnson is among at least three senior Deutsche Bank
investment bankers with clients in the energy industry to be
hired by rivals as the Frankfurt-based company leads financial
firms in advising oil and gas mergers this year. James Denaut
and Michael B. Hill are leaving for Tokyo-based Nomura, ranked
22nd, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
Morgan Stanley is ranked eighth. 
Johnson was deputy head of global banking for the Americas
at Deutsche Bank until last year, when he became a senior client
coverage officer in New York. He joined the company in 2001
after stints as chief financial officer for a technology startup
and as a banker at firms including Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette. 
He advised Oklahoma City-based SandRidge Energy Inc. when
it agreed in April to buy Arena Resources Inc. for $1.6 billion. 
Morgan Stanley is the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest merger adviser
across all industries so far this year, and Deutsche Bank is
ranked fifth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Michael Cohrs, Deutsche Bank&#8217;s co-head of investment
banking alongside Anshu Jain, plans to retire in coming weeks,
people with knowledge of his plans said earlier this month.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to set up
an investment banking joint venture in China with First Capital
Securities Co., paving the way for the U.S. bank to manage
domestic share sales in China. 
Shenzhen-based First Capital and JPMorgan signed the
agreement today following a memorandum of understanding in March,
the New York-based company said in a press release today. The
venture, to be 33 percent owned by JPMorgan, requires regulatory
approval, it said. 
JPMorgan, the world&#8217;s biggest manager of equity sales this
year, aims to close the gap with rivals in China including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG after having lagged behind
in forming ventures. Tying up with a local firm is a
prerequisite for arranging share sales in China, the world&#8217;s
biggest market for initial public offerings in 2009. 
Deutsche Bank AG last year won approval to form a venture
with Shanxi Securities Co. Credit Suisse Group AG cleared the
hurdle in 2008. CSLA Asia-Pacific Markets&#8217;s securities venture
also won approval to offer brokerage services that year, after
operating in the country for about five years. 
First Capital, established a decade ago, offers corporate
finance, fixed income, merger-and-acquisition, securities
brokerage and asset management services. It has branches in 12
Chinese cities, according to the statement. 
Biggest IPO Market 
Companies raised 209 billion yuan ($31 billion) in IPOs in
Shanghai and Shenzhen last year, making China the world&#8217;s
biggest market for first-time stock sales even after the
securities regulator blocked offerings in the first half. 
JPMorgan spent four years in failed talks with Bohai
Securities Co. and Liaoning Securities Co., Asia-Pacific Chief
Executive Officer Gaby Abdelnour said in a March 2 interview. 
The bank now has asset management and futures and options
ventures and operates a locally incorporated bank in China. It
must wait five-years to qualify for a brokerage license under
rules set by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. 
First Capital was ranked 33rd among underwriters in China
last year after it arranged 6.76 billion yuan in stock and bond
sales, according to the Securities Association of China. The
ranking made the firm eligible to form a partnership with a
foreign bank, under the nation&#8217;s securities laws.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said he sees no signs of a resolution to the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud claims against the
firm. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s no indications of anything at this point,&#8221; Cohn
told reporters at a conference in Montreal today. 
Cohn&#8217;s comments follow news that the SEC is probing a
second Goldman Sachs collateralized debt obligation in addition
to the Abacus transaction at the center of the SEC&#8217;s suit. Asked
about the new investigation, Cohn, 49, told reporters: &#8220;I read
it in the newspaper this morning, like you did.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock fell as much as 4 percent today to
its lowest in more than a year after a person familiar with the
matter said the SEC is looking into the firm&#8217;s 2006 sale of a
CDO called Hudson Mezzanine. While the inquiries may not lead to
any action, the news came less than a week after the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission subpoenaed New York-based Goldman
Sachs for information and an Australian hedge fund sued the
firm. 
The shares fell $3.03, or 2.2 percent, at $133.77 as of
4:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after
dropping as low as $131.30. The last time the shares closed
below $132 was on May 13, 2009. 
Goldman Sachs has fallen for six straight days, the longest
losing streak since October 2008.

He will join the New York-based company on Sept. 9,
according to an internal memo confirmed by Sandra Hernandez, a
spokeswoman. 
Parker spent more than 10 years at Bernstein, an investment

manager of $466 billion. Most recently he was chief investment
strategist and director of quantitative research, according to

of research and senior semiconductor analyst. 
Stephen Penwell, head of North America equity research,
will oversee Parker, who will make the firm&#8217;s forecasts for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Jason Todd, a global equity

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s $2
billion Hudson Mezzanine collateralized debt obligation, sold in
2006, is the target of a probe by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
The inquiry into the CDO may not lead to any additional
actions against the New York-based securities firm, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the investigation
isn&#8217;t public. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. The
Financial Times reported the probe yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs shares have fallen 26 percent since the SEC
filed a fraud lawsuit against the firm on April 16 that related
to its 2007 sale of a CDO called Abacus. Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat, said in April that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sales of
CDOs such as Hudson raised &#8220;a real ethical issue.&#8221; 
&#8220;The ethical issue is valid, but Goldman isn&#8217;t the only
investment bank&#8221; that sold CDOs, said Ambrose Chang, a Hong
Kong-based fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments HK Ltd. &#8220;After
the financial crisis, all Wall Street banks&#8217; reputations have
been fundamentally damaged.&#8221; 
In the Abacus suit, the SEC said Goldman Sachs and one of
its employees, Fabrice Tourre, didn&#8217;t disclose to investors the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. in devising and betting
against the securities. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing on
the Abacus CDO and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s case. 
Hedge Fund Suit 
CDOs parcel fixed-income assets such as bonds or loans and
slice them into new securities of varying risks, providing
higher returns than other investments of the same rating. 
In a separate case, Goldman Sachs was sued by Australian
hedge fund Basis Capital for $1 billion. In the suit, filed
yesterday in Manhattan federal court, Basis claims it was forced
into insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities that the
firm created and one of its executives termed &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
&#8220;The lawsuit is a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
said in a statement. 
The U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
led by Levin, released e-mails in April related to Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s mortgage-linked deals, including the Hudson Mezzanine
transaction. In one October 2006 e-mail, a Goldman Sachs
employee describes how the Hudson deal might be viewed by
investors as &#8220;junk.&#8221; 
Hudson Mezzanine 
The Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1 CDO contained credit default
swaps that referenced $2 billion in subprime, BBB-rated
residential mortgage-backed securities, according to the
documents released by Levin&#8217;s committee. While Goldman Sachs
selected the assets in the deal, the firm was also the only
investor buying credit protection on the entire transaction, the
documents show. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the Hudson CDO in late 2006,
near the time documents released by Levin show senior executives
wanted to reduce the firm&#8217;s exposure to subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;The CDO imploded within two years. Your clients lost;
Goldman profited,&#8221; Levin said in an April 27 hearing during
which he questioned Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein about the Hudson deal and other CDOs. &#8220;To go out and
sell these securities to people and then bet against those same
securities, it seems to me, is a fundamental conflict of
interest and is -- raises a real ethical issue.&#8221; 
Blankfein responded that &#8220;we are one of the largest client
franchises in market-making in these kinds of activities we&#8217;re
talking about&#8221; and that &#8220;they know our activities, and they
understand what market-making is.&#8221; 
While Goldman Sachs was short on the Hudson Mezzanine CDO,
meaning it stood to gain from a collapse because of the credit
protection it had purchased, a marketing document for the deal
released by Levin&#8217;s committee states that &#8220;Goldman Sachs has
aligned incentives with the Hudson program.&#8221; 
In a short sale, an investor bets the value of a security
will decline.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired law

The law firm, founded by David Boies and Jonathan Schiller

executives described internally as a &#8220;shi**y deal.&#8221; 
Boies, Schiller joins a growing list of firms providing
legal and regulatory advice to Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, which was sued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in April over its marketing
of another CDO known as Abacus. 
Richard H. Klapper at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP is among the
partners leading Goldman Sachs&#8217;s defense against the SEC
lawsuit. The firm also received advice ahead of a U.S. Senate
subcommittee hearing in April from K. Lee Blalack II of
O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, who has worked as the subcommittee&#8217;s
chief counsel and staff director. 
Skadden Arps 
Gregory Craig, President Barack Obama&#8217;s former White House
counsel, is now the partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher 
Flom LLP assigned to advise Goldman Sachs. 
Last month, Goldman Sachs considered hiring law firm Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP to bolster its legal
team, before deciding against it, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time. 
In a June 9 statement about the Timberwolf lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs called it &#8220;a misguided attempt by Basis, a hedge fund
that was one of the world&#8217;s most experienced CDO investors, to
shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley, once the biggest
property investor among Wall Street banks, raised $4.7 billion
for a new global real estate fund, less than half its target
before the financial crisis. 
Some of the New York-based firm&#8217;s largest institutional
clients didn&#8217;t put money in the new fund after market losses.
The Washington State Investment Board, which placed $880 million
in two prior Morgan Stanley property funds, decided against
committing new capital. 
&#8220;We will not be investing in the new fund because it is
global including U.S. and we already have a large U.S.
concentration,&#8221; Liz Mendizabal, spokeswoman for the Olympia-
based pension board, said in an e-mail today. 
Many investors have shied away from real estate deals amid
falling property values and scarcer debt financing. Morgan
Stanley had hoped to raise $10 billion for the fund, according
to minutes from a June 2008 meeting of the Contra Costa County
Employees&#8217; Retirement Association. Still, the fund is the
largest to close since 2008. 
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII will invest in the U.S.
and internationally, said company spokeswoman Alyson Barnes,
noting that the firm supplied less than 10 percent of the
capital. 
&#8216;Significant&#8217; Opportunities 
The real estate fund will &#8220;take advantage of the
significant investment opportunities this part of the real
estate cycle presents to us,&#8221; Morgan Stanley said in a
statement. 
Wall Street firms may be barred from owning and investing
in hedge funds and private equity under the so-called Volcker
rule, part of the Senate&#8217;s financial reform bill. Lawmakers from
the House and Senate are merging bills passed by the two
chambers into a single measure for President Barack Obama&#8217;s
signature. 
Morgan Stanley, which managed $46.4 billion of real estate
assets for clients as of March 31, suffered losses in its last
fund. The firm told investors this year that it expects to lose
$5.4 billion of an $8.8 billion real estate fund from 2007, a
person familiar with the situation said in April. 
Concord, California-based Contra Costa County Employees&#8217;
Retirement Association rescinded its decision to invest $75
million in the new fund in February 2009, citing market risk and
staff departures at Morgan Stanley. New Jersey&#8217;s pension fund
also decided not to pursue a $150 million potential investment. 
John Klopp 
To bolster its real estate effort, Morgan Stanley named
John Klopp as head of investing in Americas real estate and
global property debt in February, and its Alternative Investment
Partners fund of funds business raised $370 million for a fund
focused on private-equity real estate funds. 
Morgan Stanley recorded about $4.4 billion in real estate
losses in 2008 and 2009. In April, the firm booked a $932
million loss on its investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC,
the developer of an unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City,
New Jersey. In November, Morgan Stanley agreed to hand over
Crescent Real Estate Equities to Barclays Capital, ending its
obligation on a $2 billion loan. 
The firm sent a fourth-quarter update to clients of its
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VI International showing it was
likely to recover $3.4 billion of its investments, the person
said in April. The California State Teachers&#8217; Retirement
System&#8217;s $440 million investment in the fund has declined 86
percent as of Sept. 30, 2009, according to figures provided by
spokeswoman Sherry Reser.

Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are expected to lead General Motors Co.&#8217;s initial public
offering that may have the U.S. reducing its ownership as soon
as this year, people familiar with the matter said. 
At least five investment banks competed to handle the sale,
which may be worth as much as $12 billion, making it the second-
largest in a decade. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, both based in
New York, would be responsible for writing the prospectus and
promoting the shares to potential investors, said two people who
asked not to be identified because the decision isn&#8217;t final. 
Returning GM to public ownership will allow the U.S. to
reduce its 61 percent stake and harvest returns on its $50
billion investment in the nation&#8217;s largest automaker. Choosing a
lead bank in June means Detroit-based GM may hold an offering in
the fourth quarter, people familiar with the matter have said. 
&#8220;The government wants out as quickly as possible, but they
also want to tell the public it&#8217;s a good deal,&#8221; David Cole,
chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, said in an interview. &#8220;They will want to be out before
the presidential election in 2012.&#8221; 
Mark Paustenbach, a spokesman for the Treasury, declined to
comment, citing a department statement yesterday that said
federal securities laws preclude it from discussing the identity
of potential underwriters before a registration statement is
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A GM
spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem, also declined to comment. 
Automotive Lending 
GM Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre wants the company to
have an automotive-lending unit before going public, people
familiar with the plan have said. GM hasn&#8217;t had such a
subsidiary since former CEO Rick Wagoner sold 51 percent of GMAC
to private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP in 2006. 
Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said May 17 the
automaker&#8217;s first-quarter net profit of $865 million was a
&#8220;good, useful step&#8221; toward an initial offering. He said that
the stock sale may not come until 2011 and that it wouldn&#8217;t be
necessary to control a financing unit before going public. 
The banks&#8217; expected selection was reported earlier by the
Wall Street Journal. 
GM&#8217;s choice will be &#8220;subject to Treasury&#8217;s agreement that
the selection is reasonable,&#8221; the government said yesterday in a
statement. The Treasury and GM are expected to sell shares, and
other holders may participate, the government said. 
IPO Timing 
The timing of the offering will depend on GM&#8217;s
profitability, the health of the economy and the state of
capital markets, said three people familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;It will happen when the markets are ready and when the
company is ready,&#8221; Liddell said May 17 on a conference call. 
The sale may raise as much as $12 billion, an estimate by
Independent International Investment Research Plc showed. 
GM&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s bond prices, GM&#8217;s
implied equity value is about $47 billion. 
Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group&#8217;s $10.6
billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.&#8217;s $8.68 billion deal
in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.&#8217;s $5.47 billion sale in
1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The size of the sale hasn&#8217;t been determined yet, said one
person familiar with the plan. 
Bankruptcy Emergence 
GM emerged from bankruptcy in July with its ownership split
between the old bondholders, the U.S., Canada and a trust to
cover health care for union retirees. 
The U.S. government&#8217;s current net investment in the
automaker is $42.2 billion, according to a senior official in
President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration. GM has repaid $6.7
billion in loans and paid $600 million in interest and
dividends. The U.S. also holds $2.1 billion in the company&#8217;s
preferred shares. 
&#8220;When we did this restructuring we never expected a full
recovery of our investment,&#8221; Steven Rattner, the former head of
Obama&#8217;s automotive task force, said May 10 in Detroit. &#8220;If it
ends up costing us $10 billion, we should consider it a
success.&#8221; 
For the Treasury to break even, the value of GM would need
to rise to about $80 billion after bondholders and the UAW&#8217;s
health-care trust exercise stock warrants that dilute the U.S.
ownership. 
Lazard Advice 
The Treasury has hired Lazard Ltd. for $500,000 a month to
advise on selling its stake, according to a document on the
department&#8217;s website. Evercore Partners Inc. also is advising GM
on the selection, a person familiar with the matter said. 
GM and Treasury officials met with senior executives from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley last month in Washington about
hiring a lead bank, said one person familiar with the matter. 
The Treasury said yesterday that it will determine the
underwriters&#8217; fees, which finance professors at Cornell
University and Georgetown estimate may be as low as 2 percent.
That would be less than any U.S. IPO over $5 billion since 1999,
Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;General Motors is a government entity now, and the banks
that may underwrite the deal were government entities or got
help from the government,&#8221; said William Smith, president of New
York-based Smith Asset Management, which used to own shares of
GM. &#8220;I imagine with the IPO they&#8217;ll do the politically correct
thing and keep fees down.&#8221; 
Choosing a lead underwriter now allows GM to file an S-1
initial registration form as soon as July and sell shares in
October or November, a person familiar with the matter said. 
GM management has been preparing for an IPO so they will be
ready whenever the timing is right, said a GM executive who
asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. 
Whitacre was installed as chairman by Obama&#8217;s task force
when it replaced more than half of the directors in July.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $716.3
million of bonds backed by commercial mortgages in the second
offering of the debt this year, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. 
The largest top-rated portion, maturing in 4.53 years,
yields 140 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren&#8217;t public. The AAA rated slice maturing in about 9.53 years
yields 165 basis points over the benchmark, the person said. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 
Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities halted in
2008 as credit markets froze, choking off funding to property
borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion of the
debt was issued last year, compared with $11.2 billion in 2008
and a record $232.4 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. 
Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold $309.7 million of the
bonds in April, the first issue to pool loans from multiple
borrowers since June 2008. 
Top-rated securities tied to commercial property loans
yield about 3.04 percentage points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, compared with 2.19 percentage points over Treasuries
on April 16, then a 22-month low, according to Barclays Plc
data. Spreads have widened on concern that the European
sovereign debt crisis may slow global economic growth.

Losses in the biggest U.S. banks and
brokerages, whose share prices are more linked to the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index than at any time in seven years, suggest the
benchmark measure of American equities may extend its seven-week
slump, according to Concept Capital&#8217;s John Kolovos. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reached $192.28 on Oct. 14, the
highest level since May 2008, and $184.46 on April 14 before
closing at $133.77 yesterday -- forming a rounding-top pattern
also seen in JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley --
suggesting the SP 500 faces losses, he said. The measure has
retreated 11 percent since April 23. 
&#8220;As long as these guys continue to move lower, mom and pop
or any big institutions will not be inclined to head into
equities,&#8221; said Kolovos, co-head of technical analysis research
for the New York-based firm. &#8220;We&#8217;re using these stocks as a
barometer.&#8221; 
A slowdown in an equity rally that eventually turns into
losses is called a rounding top by technical analysts, who base
forecasts on historical price fluctuations. Chart watchers, such
as Kolovos, say the pattern indicates stocks face more declines
in the future. 
Financial companies in the SP 500 are moving in line with
the U.S. equity benchmark. Using 30 days of trading data, the
correlation coefficient between the industry and the broader
stock index rose to 0.9724 yesterday, meaning price fluctuations
are the most similar since April 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Readings of 1 show the measures are
rising or falling in lockstep. 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings for 2009, has
fallen 21 percent to $133.77 this year after U.S. regulators
sued the company for fraud related to mortgage securities.
Morgan Stanley is down 14 percent to $25.59, while JPMorgan lost
8.1 percent to $38.29 in 2010. All three banks are based in New
York. The SP 500 has slipped 2.5 percent.

chief executive officer of the firm&#8217;s South Korea unit, has been

Note to Lloyd Blankfein: Imagine,
for a moment, what would happen if a cardiac surgeon were paid
like a Wall Street banker in 2006. 
For each operation, the doctor would earn more, regardless
of the risk to the patient, writes Suzanne McGee in &#8220;Chasing
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; The greater the risk, in fact, the higher the
fee. Should half his patients die the next year, the hospital
might dismiss the surgeon -- with a golden handshake. He could
then take up a post elsewhere or set up his own practice. 
&#8220;Wall Street doesn&#8217;t have to purchase malpractice
insurance,&#8221; says McGee in this disturbing account of how the
big boys ran amok and began blowing up the money grid. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t even a sense that there is a duty of care to the &#8216;patient&#8217;
-- whether that patient is the client or the financial system.&#8221; 
McGee, a contributing editor at Barron&#8217;s, isn&#8217;t out to bury Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or Blankfein, its chief executive
officer. Her goal is, rather, to show how Wall Street bankers
became preoccupied with their own short-term interests and
drifted away from their raison d&#8217;etre -- to funnel capital from
investors to companies that need it. 
They were, by this account, almost predestined to do so
from the moment the Securities and Exchange Commission banned
fixed trading commissions in the stock market on May 1, 1975.
The prohibition turned their comfy business model upside-down:
&#8220;Mayday,&#8221; they called it, hinting at their distress level.

Chevron Corp. is investigating the
cause and size of an oil pipeline leak in the foothills of Salt
Lake City after shutting the line. 
&#8220;Neither the source of the leak or the quantity of oil
released has been determined at this time,&#8221; said Chevron
spokesman Sean Comey in an e-mail statement. The company was
notified of the leak at around 8:20 p.m. U.S. central time
yesterday, and workers were dispatched to shut the line and
start containment of the spill, he said. 
Initial estimates said around 500 barrels seeped from the
10-inch line that has a capacity of about 15,000 barrels a day,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for Mayor Ralph Becker, citing Chevron data. 
Chevron told Smith they shut the line yesterday and were
estimating a leak of about 50 gallons a minute before it was
turned off, she said. 
Crews placed booms in waterways, including the Jordan
River, &#8220;to minimize downstream impact,&#8221; the mayor&#8217;s office
said in a release yesterday. 
A boom was also laced in a drainage creek, said Comey.
&#8220;Wildlife rehabilitation experts have been engaged&#8221; and some
birds have been washed at the Salt Lake City zoo, he said. 
The pipeline was carrying crude oil from Colorado into the
Salt Lake Valley to its refinery, Smith said. Chevron&#8217;s Salt
Lake City plant can process 45,000 barrels a day of crude,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;They haven&#8217;t given a firm timeline on when they&#8217;ll
restart the line,&#8221; Smith said.

Chevron Corp. should face a new
trial for allegedly sanctioning beatings and shootings of
Nigerian protesters in 1998 because jurors who cleared the
company in 2008 were given erroneous instructions, lawyers for
protesters argued to a U.S. appeals court today. 
A federal court jury was told, incorrectly, that the
protesters had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that company-
paid soldiers used excessive force against those who boarded
Chevron&#8217;s oil drilling platform located nine miles offshore of
the Niger Delta, said Theresa Traber, an attorney for the
Nigerians and their families. 
Instead, it was Chevron&#8217;s burden to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the peaceful protesters, who were unarmed
and running away with arms raised when shots were fired, had
committed crimes that justified the type of force used by the
soldiers, Traber told the three-judge appellate panel at today&#8217;s
hearing in San Francisco. The Nigerians were protesting over
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area. 
&#8220;This was a major error that deprived the plaintiffs of
the fair trial they should have had on their battery claims,&#8221;
Traber said. 
Two men were killed, others were shot and beaten and one
man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a protest about
jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area, according to
a 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. Nineteen Nigerians sued the
company claiming it was liable for the actions of the Nigerian
soldiers it hired to provide security for the oil platform. 
150 Workers 
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said at trial
that villagers invaded the platform and held 150 workers hostage
for ransom. They had knives, prevented workers from leaving the
platform and threatened to set it on fire, the jury was told.
The company said the soldiers acted in self-defense and denied
directing their conduct. 
Craig Stewart, an attorney at Jones Day representing
Chevron today, told the judges that the jury was given proper
instructions by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who presided
over the trial. Both sides had agreed that Nigerian law would be
applied to the battery claims by protesters, he said. 
&#8220;Nigerian law, like California law, like federal law, puts
the burden on plaintiffs to prove that the force was
excessive,&#8221; Stewart said. 
Jury Cleared Chevron 
After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. 
Lawyers for the protesters appealed the verdict to the
federal appeals court in San Francisco. The judges took the
matter under submission and didn&#8217;t say when they would issue a
decision. A ruling in favor of the protesters could lead to a
retrial on battery claims of three Nigerians injured and the
family of a man who was killed in the attacks. 
&#8220;We respect the rulings made by Judge Illston leading up
to and during the 5-week trial and believe that no errors were
made,&#8221; said Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron spokesman, in an e-mail. 
The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).

Microsoft Corp., looking to boost
profit and sales in its Xbox video-game unit, plans to start
selling a motion-controlled device called Kinect on Nov. 4 that
lets console users direct action by moving their bodies. 
The device, demonstrated with several game titles in a
University of Southern California basketball arena yesterday,
will also support video chat. The company also unveiled an
exclusive deal with Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ESPN to put live sports
events on the Xbox Live online game service, Microsoft said at a
Los Angeles press conference today. 
Microsoft, the No. 2 console seller behind Nintendo Co., is
looking to reinvigorate demand as the industry copes with an 11
percent sales decline this year in the U.S., according to data
from NPD Group Inc. Kinect may add $1.6 billion to revenue in
the fiscal year starting July 1 and $2 billion in the year after
that, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;It is unlike anything you have ever experienced before,&#8221;
Microsoft Senior Vice President Don Mattrick, who oversees the
Xbox group, said at the press conference. The system &#8220;brings
your living room to life.&#8221; 
Kinect, previously known as Project Natal, also will let
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft extend the life of its Xbox
360 console, Sarah Friar, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said in a
note. Since new machines typically lose money for the first few
years, a longer shelf life should help Microsoft improve profit
in a division that has lost $8.6 billion since 1999, according
to estimates from Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies 
Co. in San Francisco. 
Playing Catch-Up 
Microsoft&#8217;s first motion-sensing games come four years
after Nintendo started selling the Wii motion-activated system,
which helped the Kyoto-based company take the lead in console
sales. Sony Corp., maker of the PlayStation 3 console, will
demonstrate its Move motion-controller this week. 
While Kinect is geared toward family play, Microsoft also
showed off titles for traditional gamers. Activision Blizzard
Inc. played clips of its battle franchise &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; to be
released later this year, and Microsoft and the Epic Games Inc.
previewed their new &#8220;Gears of War&#8221; title. 
Microsoft will make 3,500 live sporting events from ESPN
available to customers who buy its Xbox Live gold membership.
The programming will include college football and basketball,
Major League Baseball and soccer. 
Microsoft said it now has 25 million members for Xbox Live.
The company has previously said that about half of Xbox Live
members pay for the service. 
The company also will start shipping a new Xbox machine
today. The product has a sleeker design, built-in Wi-Fi and is
less noisy than the earlier model. The machine will cost
$299.99, the same as the old model. 
Nintendo sold 277,200 Wii consoles in the U.S. in April,
compared with shipments of 185,400 Xbox 360s and 180,800
PlayStation 3s, according to NPD. 
Microsoft fell 17 cents to $25.50 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and
ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil companies, will ask
lawmakers not to punish them for the human and environmental
damage inflicted by BP Plc&#8217;s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, Chevron CEO
John Watson and James Mulva, CEO of ConocoPhillips, are
scheduled to appear tomorrow before a House Energy and Commerce
Committee panel examining offshore drilling safety and U.S.
energy policy. 
The hearing presents the U.S. oil CEOs with an opportunity
to distance their companies from BP, said Anthony Sabino, who
teaches oil and natural-gas law at St. John&#8217;s University in New
York. BP has lost 43 percent of its market value since the
disaster and has been excoriated by President Barack Obama for
repeated failures to cap the leaking well. 
&#8220;A crucifixion of the whole oil industry for the sins of
BP in the form of a ban on deep-water drilling isn&#8217;t a good idea
because look at all the people it&#8217;s going to put out of work,&#8221;
Sabino said. &#8220;Exxon and ConocoPhillips will stress their own
safety records to make that case.&#8221; 
Since an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 workers, more than 50 million
gallons of crude have poured into the Gulf from a BP-owned well,
based on calculations from a government panel. 
Obama Meeting 
The U.S. government has intensified pressure on BP to stop
the spill and pay for damages. Obama has asked to meet June 16
with BP&#8217;s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, and other company
officials. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward will appear
before the House Energy and Commerce oversight committee the
following day. 
The oil company CEOs have been asked to testify tomorrow
about the spill&#8217;s effect on U.S. energy policy, Eben Burnham-
Snyder, a spokesman for Representative Edward Markey, said June
9. Markey is a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the
subcommittee holding the hearing. 
The executives may also be pressed to explain dividend
payouts and share buyback programs that have dwarfed their
investments in alternatives to petroleum, such as solar and
wind, according to a June 12 memorandum written by Congressional
staff and distributed to lawmakers who will participate in
tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. 
Executive Pleas 
Tillerson, Watson and Mulva probably will ask lawmakers to
avoid changes in offshore drilling rules that could discourage
exploration in U.S. territorial waters without making meaningful
contributions to safety, said Gianna Bern, president of
Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois,
which advises oil companies on strategy and risk management. 
Tillerson will tell lawmakers that an investigation needs
to determine if BP took risks &#8220;beyond industry norms,&#8221;
according to prepared remarks he&#8217;s scheduled to deliver during
tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. Proper well design, redundant safety systems
and regular maintenance and tests help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level for oil and natural
gas, he said. 
Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, said he couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. Nancy Turner,
a spokeswoman for Houston-based ConocoPhillips, said in an e-
mail that the company wouldn&#8217;t release Mulva&#8217;s prepared remarks. 
More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to cease
drilling off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas for at least six
months while federal officials conduct a review of offshore
safety practices. The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil
production, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
Drilling Pause 
The drilling halt may cut oil production in the Gulf by as
much as 11 percent next year, said Paul Cheng, a Barclays
Capital analyst. 
&#8220;These executives need to explain to the politicians that
if you permanently shut us down in the deep water it&#8217;s going to
wreak havoc with energy production and put the United States
even more at the mercy of foreign oil producers,&#8221; Sabino said. 
Also scheduled to appear before tomorrow&#8217;s panel are Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the presidents of the U.S. units of BP
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, respectively. 
Lawmakers may ask Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell
to describe safety measures they have used offshore to avoid the
sort of disaster BP faced, said Bern, a former BP crude trader. 
Exxon, which pumps more crude than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, abandoned an exploration
project known as Blackbeard in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 rather
than risk a blowout. The company quit the project, which sought
to drill more than six miles (9.7 kilometers) beneath the
seafloor, after repeated pressure surges indicated the well was
unstable. 
Controlling Macondo 
BP engineers alerted federal regulators at the Minerals
Management Service that they were having difficulty controlling
the Macondo well six weeks before the disaster, according to e-
mails released by the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this would have happened on Exxon&#8217;s
watch,&#8221; Tom Bower, author of &#8220;The Squeeze: Oil, Money and
Greed in the 21st Century,&#8221; said in a June 11 Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;They&#8217;d be much more careful and much
more conscious of the need to supervise subcontractors.&#8221;

Teun Draaisma, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s top-

Following Draaisma&#8217;s departure, Graham Secker will head the

best European equity strategist in the 2009 Thomson Extel
survey. 
In December, Draaisma was the only strategist among 16
surveyed by Bloomberg to forecast a retreat in European stocks
by the end of 2010. He raised his recommendation on the region&#8217;s
equities to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;underweight&#8221; on May 10 to
&#8220;take advantage of the recent weakness.&#8221; The benchmark Stoxx

Draaisma was joint head of European strategy with Ben Funnell from 2003 until 2006, when Funnell moved to hedge fund
GLG Partners Inc. A call to TT International was referred to the

Electricite de France SA, Europe&#8217;s
biggest power generator, and other French utilities are ready to
start publishing forecasts for individual power-plant
availability by the end of the month. 
The production outlook for the short- and medium-term for
power stations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts will
be disclosed by the end of June, said Soizic Hemion, deputy head
of the Union Francaise de l&#8217;Electricite, the trade organization
for power producers that includes EDF and GDF Suez SA. 
Utilities are testing publication through the existing
power data website of the Reseau de Transport d&#8217; Electricite,
she said. RTE is wholly owned by EDF. 
At the end of 2010, information on unplanned outages at
power stations with capacities of more than 100 megawatts will
be disclosed within 30 minutes, Hemion said. 
The two-stage plan to expand publicly available information
on power plants in France was announced by the trade group last
November following criticism of EDF by France&#8217;s energy regulator
for posting &#8220;insufficient&#8221; forecasts about power production. 
Generation data is important because prices hinge on how
much power is being produced at any given time. Electricity,
unlike other commodities, can&#8217;t be stored, so unexpected supply
cuts in one country may mean soaring prices in another part of
Europe&#8217;s interconnected markets. 
EDF now provides information about halts and restarts at
its 58 nuclear reactors, which provide more than three quarters
of the country&#8217;s power, on recorded messages on answering
machines at 19 plants. These are often updated weekly. The
utility has long resisted publishing real-time information on
the grounds that it is &#8220;commercially sensitive.&#8221;

Tesla Motors Inc., the maker of
electric sports cars that hasn&#8217;t posted a profit since its
founding in 2003, said it will seek to raise $178 million
selling a 12 percent stake in its initial public offering. 
The producer of the $109,000 electric Roadster will offer
11.1 million shares at $14 to $16 each on June 29 and use the
proceeds to pay for factories and possible acquisitions, a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing and data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Tesla filed in January to raise as much as
$100 million without disclosing how many shares it intended to
sell or the price range. 
The automaker is pushing forward with its sale even after
the European debt crisis spurred at least 34 companies to
postpone or withdraw IPOs since the start of May. Tesla, which
has sold about 1,000 Roadsters while losing $290 million, is
using the share sale and a $465 million loan from the government
to help produce its second electric car, the Model S sedan. 
&#8220;Bringing a completely new type of vehicle to market can
cost $1 billion, and Tesla may be looking at that level of
expense,&#8221; said Eric Noble, president of The CarLab, an
automotive consulting company in Orange, California. &#8220;The
danger for the early investor is that if Tesla can&#8217;t find the
next section of funding, it&#8217;s a bridge to nowhere.&#8221; 
Tesla hired New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co., along with Deutsche Bank AG in
Frankfurt, to lead the sale. 
CEO Musk 
Existing stockholders including Chief Executive Officer
Elon Musk will sell 1.1 million shares. He spent more than $70
million of his own money on Tesla before May 2009, when
Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler AG invested $50 million. 
Musk, who co-founded PayPal Inc., the online payment
company now owned by San Jose, California-based EBay Inc., is
also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Inc., a
Hawthorne, California-based company that builds spacecraft. 
Tesla has delivered more than 1,000 of its electric
Roadster sports cars since 2008 and intends to fill orders for
an additional 1,200. The Model S sedan is going into production
in 2012 in a former Toyota Motor Corp.-General Motors Co. joint
venture factory in Fremont, California, which the company is
buying for $42 million. 
Tesla won loans from the U.S. Energy Department in 2009
worth as much as $465 million to get the Model S into production
and expand output of battery packs the company assembles. 
Divorce Proceedings 
Under terms of the federal loan, Musk and certain
affiliates must retain 65 percent of their capital stock in
Tesla for a year after completing the Model S project. Musk&#8217;s
divorce proceedings won&#8217;t result in him owning less than 65
percent or have a material impact on his ability to serve as
CEO, according to filings. 
Toyota agreed last month to purchase $50 million in Tesla
shares. Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota and Tesla say they may
cooperate on electric-vehicle development, though they haven&#8217;t
signed agreements to do so, filings show. 
&#8220;The Toyota connection may help,&#8221; said John Wolkonowicz,
an auto analyst at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts. &#8220;It depends on how involved Toyota becomes.&#8221; 
Tesla is also backed by investors including Mountain View,
California-based Google Inc.&#8217;s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the government of Abu Dhabi, and Daimler, the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of luxury vehicles. 
Relative Value 
At its midpoint price of $15, Tesla is valued at 6 times
net tangible book value, a measure of shareholder equity that
excludes assets that can&#8217;t be sold in liquidation. That&#8217;s about
five times higher than the median ratio of 1.21 for 45
automotive companies globally, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
&#8220;The last America auto company started from whole cloth
that had any record of success was Hudson Motors in 1909,&#8221;
Wolkonowicz said. &#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ve found a formula that works,
but history would argue against them.&#8221; 
GM of Detroit has also said that it may sell shares to the
public this year, while Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Zipcar
Inc., the car-sharing company that rents vehicles by the hour,
filed this month to raise as much as $75 million in an IPO.

The top six U.S. credit-card
lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and
Capital One Financial Corp., said overdue loans fell in May as
consumers avoided taking on new debt amid the economic recovery. 
Loans at least 30 days late, a signal of future write-
offs, dropped to 4.22 percent in May compared with 4.4 percent
in the previous month and the lowest since last July, New York-
based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. Write-offs of
loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging indicator, fell except at
Bank of America and Discover Financial Services. 
The decline in overdue loans signals that the credit-card
industry continues to recover from a record $89 billion of
write-offs last year, when the U.S. unemployment rate topped 10
percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the U.S. economy, may remain muted as people focus on
&#8220;deleveraging,&#8221; according to Capital One Chief Executive
Officer Richard Fairbank. 
&#8220;What they&#8217;re really doing is choosing not necessarily to
go load up on some credit cards, but more to pay down debt,&#8221;
Fairbank said at an investor conference earlier this month.
&#8220;This deleveraging phenomenon hasn&#8217;t provided strength to the
economy.&#8221; 
American Express Co., the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, said overdue loans fell to 2.9 percent last month
from 3.1 percent in April. Late payments dropped to 4.8 percent
from 5.07 percent at McLean, Virginia-based Capital One; 6.39
percent from 6.73 percent at Bank of America; 5.59 percent from
5.85 percent at New York-based Citigroup Inc., and 4.95 percent
from 5.2 percent at Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois. 
Write-offs declined to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent at New
York-based AmEx, the lowest for the group. They rose to 13.33
percent from 12.71 percent at Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, which posted the highest level of
losses. Discover increased to 8.82 percent from 8.42 percent.

Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are as ill-prepared as
BP Plc to halt and clean up an offshore oil spill because they
all use &#8220;carbon copy&#8221; disaster plans, lawmakers said. 
Eight weeks after a drilling rig leased by BP exploded in
the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst
spill in U.S. history, executives from the companies sought at a
House Energy Committee hearing to distance themselves from BP&#8217;s
practices that lawmakers said put profits before safety. 
Lawmakers faulted the four executives for disaster-response
plans that would halt oil leaks at the sea floor using the same
techniques that failed for BP at its Macondo well. The same firm
wrote the plans and included references to making sure crude
doesn&#8217;t injure walruses, which don&#8217;t live in the Gulf of Mexico. 
&#8220;The oil company response plans are great for public
relations but these plans are virtually worthless in the event
of a spill,&#8221; said Representative Bart T. Stupak, a Michigan
Democrat. &#8220;It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the
bunch, but unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of
company.&#8221; 
Energy companies, rig operators and lawmakers in oil-
producing states have urged the Obama administration to lift or
shorten a six-month moratorium on deepwater exploration that has
idled more than two dozen drilling vessels and threatens
thousands of jobs. Lawmakers said today they&#8217;re not convinced
the industry takes safety seriously. 
&#8216;Magic Button&#8217; 
&#8220;You can&#8217;t have a contingency plan that says cross your
fingers and hope the blowout preventer works,&#8221; said
Representative Joe Barton of Texas, the committee&#8217;s senior
Republican. &#8220;They pushed the magic button on the BP rig and it
didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; 
Exxon wouldn&#8217;t have used the well design, cement mixture or
testing procedures BP employed at the Macondo well, CEO Rex Tillerson told lawmakers today. The BP project faced &#8220;a lot of
indications of problems&#8221; in the weeks before the explosion,
Tillerson said. Shell&#8217;s U.S. president, Marvin Odum, and Chevron
CEO John Watson said they wouldn&#8217;t have drilled the well in the
same manner as BP. 
&#8220;Our internal review confirmed what our regular audits
have told us,&#8221; Watson told the committee. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s drilling
and control practices for deepwater wells are safe and
environmentally sound.&#8221; 
&#8216;Deliberate Deception&#8217; 
The CEOs testified a day after the committee released
internal BP documents that lawmakers said showed the company put
cost concerns ahead of safety in the days leading up to April
20. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward is to appear before
a subcommittee June 17, his first congressional testimony since
the well exploded. 
In a preview of questions Hayward may face, Markey asked
Lamar McKay, president of BP America Inc., today why BP&#8217;s
initial estimates of the spill&#8217;s flow rate turned out to be
several times less than the actual leak. The initial estimates
reflected either a &#8220;deliberate deception or gross
incompetence,&#8221; Markey said. 
&#8220;We are sorry for everything the Gulf coast is going
through,&#8221; McKay said. 
BP, the biggest Gulf of Mexico oil producer, made five
&#8220;questionable decisions&#8221; aimed at cutting costs and speeding
completion of an overdue project before the disaster, Democratic
Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Stupak wrote in a
letter to Hayward released yesterday. 
Walruses in Plans 
Markey pressed the CEOs on why their safety plans for a
Gulf spill described the effects on walruses. Two of the
companies also incorporated contact information for a Florida
marine researcher who died in 2005, Markey said. 
&#8220;The plan needs to be updated more frequently,&#8221;
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva said. &#8220;Obviously, it is
embarrassing.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that walruses were included, and it&#8217;s an
embarrassment,&#8221; Tillerson said. 
President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation tonight
on the spill, and the administration is demanding that BP set up
an escrow account for damage claims. BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has been called to the White House tomorrow. 
Industry groups oppose the six-month ban, which Obama put
in place to give a presidential commission time to probe the
spill. Pressed by Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu,
who said her state could lose 330,000 jobs from the moratorium,
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last week said the ban may be
shortened. 
Lost Jobs, Wages 
&#8220;We acknowledge the reasons for the president&#8217;s decision
to pause deepwater drilling,&#8221; Shell&#8217;s Odum said in his prepared
remarks. &#8220;But it is not without consequence: thousands of lost
jobs, and billions in lost wages and spending. And not only on
the Gulf Coast, but also in places like Alaska.&#8221; 
Seventeen House members from Gulf coast states including
Barton and Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, today
called on Obama to end the drilling ban. The group will meet
Salazar tomorrow to discuss the impact of the moratorium. 
&#8220;Many offshore drilling companies and suppliers will not be
able to survive this six-month period and will either go out of
business or move their employees and assets abroad,&#8221; the group
said in a statement. An extended suspension may cost more than
20,000 jobs in Gulf region, according to a statement. 
Exxon&#8217;s Rigs Moving 
Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf,
Tillerson said. The company will send deepwater drilling rigs to
other parts of the world during the administration&#8217;s moratorium,
he said. 
&#8220;We will redirect our human resources, the technical
talent, to other parts of the world where we&#8217;re allowed to work,
and we will redirect the equipment elsewhere,&#8221; Tillerson said.
&#8220;This stuff is too expensive to let them sit around.&#8221; 
When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deepwater drilling to resume, there may be few rigs available
for the work, said Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory
 Research Inc. in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil
companies on strategy and risk management. 
Drilling vessels are steaming out of the Gulf for
assignments in the South China Sea and off the Indonesia coast,
said Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won&#8217;t be able
to return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. 
&#8220;The moratorium will likely draw drilling rigs away from
the Gulf of Mexico to overseas basins, further delaying
development and negatively affecting crucial U.S. jobs that
support these operations,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;Any extension of the
moratorium will only exacerbate the economic consequences.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. Chairman
Stephen Roach said governments and central banks may be sowing
the seeds of a future crisis by keeping overly accommodative
monetary and fiscal policy stances for too long. 
&#8220;Policy makers are making a mistake by pretty much&#8221;
maintaining policies &#8220;in stimulative positions for too long,&#8221;
Roach said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from Hong
Kong. &#8220;It ends up setting the stage for the next crisis.&#8221; 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 10
that the U.S. recovery isn&#8217;t as strong as he would like and that
the impact of Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis must be considered,
suggesting the central bank remains attached to its pledge to
keep interest rates at a record low for an &#8220;extended period.&#8221; 
President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration is forecasting a
record annual budget deficit of $1.6 trillion. The shortfall is
projected to be $10 trillion over the next 10 years, with
interest payments on debt forecast by the Congressional Budget
Office to quadruple to more than $900 billion annually. 
&#8220;Excess sovereign debt is a problem that is endemic in the
developed world,&#8221; Roach said. &#8220;At this point in time, we still
have ample slack in the global economy and an absence of
inflation pressures, but with central banks likely to remain
excessively accommodative for an extended period of time, then
the current benign environment could give way to more serious
inflation further down the road.&#8221; 
Wild Card 
The &#8220;big wild card&#8221; in the global economy is rising trade
tensions between the U.S. and China, Roach said. Chinese exports
rose 48.5 percent in May, helping yield a $19.5 billion trade
surplus for the month. 
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on June 11 that
legislation aimed at getting China to raise the value of its
currency has &#8220;huge&#8221; support in Congress, and Obama &#8220;runs the
risk&#8221; of being overridden if he vetoes it. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m fairly worried given the politics in Washington and
the relatively high unemployment in the U.S.,&#8221; Roach said.
&#8220;The U.S.-China trade imbalance is large, but it&#8217;s important to
keep in mind America ran&#8221; a trade deficit with 90 countries
last year. &#8220;We have a multilateral trade problem because we
don&#8217;t save. You don&#8217;t fix that by forcing one of your partners
to achieve a bilateral currency adjustment.&#8221; 
Roach also said that India needs to raise interest rates to
stem a jump in prices.

Morgan Stanley plans to increase the
number of private bankers in India by 50 percent within a year,
Amitava Neogi, executive director at Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Indian
wealth management unit, said in an interview yesterday. 
&#8220;The wealth in Asia and emerging markets is growing thanks
to economic growth,&#8221; said Mumbai-based Neogi, who plans to add
20 advisers to the 40 employed in the South Asian nation.
&#8220;India has favorable demographics, entrepreneurial spirit and a
growing young population with increasing purchasing power.&#8221; 
India&#8217;s economy expanded 8.6 percent in the three months
through March. The number of billionaires in the nation rose to
52 from 27, Forbes magazine said last year. 
Wealth in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, is
expected to rise at almost double the global rate, according to
an annual study by the Boston Consulting Group. 
The region will increase its share of global wealth from 15
percent last year to almost 20 percent in 2014, with China and
India the engines of growth, according to the report released on
June 10. Together, the two countries will make up 75 percent, or
almost $9 trillion, of the increase in assets managed in the
region. 
Asian billionaires including India&#8217;s Mukesh Ambani and Hong
Kong&#8217;s Li Ka-shing increased their wealth as the region&#8217;s rich
expanded their fortunes at the world&#8217;s quickest pace in the past
year, Forbes said. 
Morgan Stanley plans to double its private bankers in Asia
over the next three years, Charles Mak, head of private wealth
management for Asia, has said. 
The bank is competing with rivals including UBS AG,
Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG to hire financial
advisers in a market with an estimated $7.4 trillion of private
riches. The combined wealth of Asia-Pacific millionaires will
increase 8.8 percent annually until 2018, compared with a global
average of 7.1 percent, according to a report by Capgemini SA
and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. 
Morgan Stanley currently manages about 1,000 family
accounts in India and expects the number to rise to between
2,000 and 3,000 accounts, Neogi said.

Federal investigators must determine
if BP Plc took risks &#8220;beyond industry norms&#8221; with the Gulf of
Mexico well that exploded and caused the worst U.S. oil spill,
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. 
The April 20 disaster that killed 11 workers and sank
Transocean Ltd.&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig &#8220;represents a
dramatic departure&#8221; from the track record of deep-water oil
explorers, Tillerson said in remarks prepared for a House Energy
and Commerce Committee panel hearing today. 
Something went wrong at the BP project about 5,000 feet
(1,524 meters) below the sea surface that hasn&#8217;t happened at the
14,000 other deep-water wells drilled without incident worldwide,
Tillerson said. The catastrophe has damaged livelihoods and
coastal environments and will cause loss of public trust in the
oil industry, he said. 
&#8220;We need to know if the levels of risk taken went beyond
industry norms,&#8221; said Tillerson, who oversees a company that
pumps more oil than every member of OPEC except Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq. 
Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has drilled 262 deep-water
wells in the past decade, 35 of which were in the Gulf of Mexico,
he said. Proper well design, workforce training, redundant
safety systems and regular maintenance help mitigate the risks
involved in drilling miles below sea level, Tillerson said in
the remarks. 
&#8216;Questionable Decisions&#8217; 
BP, the biggest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico, made
five &#8220;questionable decisions&#8221; aimed at cutting costs and
speeding completion of an overdue project in the days and weeks
preceding the disaster, U.S. Representatives Henry Waxman of
California and Bart Stupak of Michigan wrote in a letter to BP
CEO Tony Hayward that was released yesterday. 
Hayward is scheduled to testify before U.S. lawmakers on
June 17. David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, said in an e-mail it
would be inappropriate to comment ahead of Hayward&#8217;s testimony. 
Exxon overhauled its safety procedures after the 1989
Valdez tanker spill off the Alaskan coast, Tillerson said in his
remarks. The Valdez incident, which Tillerson described as &#8220;the
low point&#8217; in Exxon&#8217;s history, was one of the worst U.S. spills
before the failure of BP&#8217;s Macondo well. 
John Watson, chief executive officer at Chevron Corp., and
ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva are scheduled to testify at
today&#8217;s hearing in Washington. Lamar McKay and Marvin Odum, the
presidents of the U.S. units of BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
respectively, have also accepted invitations. 
Increased Scrutiny 
Shell follows well-drilling safety standards that lawmakers
have said were sidestepped by BP, Odum said in a May 14 letter
to Elizabeth Birnbaum, former director of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, which oversees the offshore drilling
industry. Shell&#8217;s plans to explore for oil and natural gas off
Alaska&#8217;s coast face increased scrutiny as a result of the Gulf
oil spill. 
&#8220;Shell has design standards and practices that have
enabled us to successfully and safely drill many deep-water and
shallow-water wells worldwide,&#8221; Odum said in the letter to
Birnbaum. &#8220;Shell will rigorously apply an appropriate similar
level of standards in all well operations on the Alaska&#8221; outer
continental shelf. 
More than 30 deep-water rigs have been ordered to stop
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for at least six months while
federal officials conduct a review of offshore safety practices.
The moratorium has forced Exxon, Shell and other major oil
companies to suspend their deepwater exploration plans in the
Gulf. 
Rigs Leaving 
The Gulf accounts for 30 percent of U.S. oil production,
according to the Energy Information Administration. 
When the moratorium is lifted and federal regulators allow
deep-water oil exploration to resume, there may be few rigs
remaining in the Gulf of Mexico to do the work, said
Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc.
in Flossmoor, Illinois, which advises oil companies on strategy
and risk management. 
Drilling vessels are starting to leave the Gulf to take up
assignments in the South China Sea and offshore Indonesia, said
Bern, a former BP crude trader. Those vessels won&#8217;t be able to
return to U.S. waters for a year or longer, she said. 
&#8220;This is a challenging time for everyone in the industry
because there&#8217;s some level of guilt by association going on,&#8221;
Bern said. &#8220;With oil continuing to spew out in the Gulf of
Mexico, the whole industry is going to be set back.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. to recover all claims the
guarantor might have to pay on $378 million of coverage provided
for sewer bonds issued by Jefferson County, Alabama. 
Assured, the top U.S. municipal debt insurer by volume,
said in a lawsuit filed today in New York State Supreme court in
Manhattan that New York-based JPMorgan concealed about $3
million in illegal payments to friends of county commissioners
to ensure it won business with the county. Some of the payments
were then funneled to the officials, the complaint said. 
&#8220;Had JPMorgan and the county not misrepresented and
concealed from Assured the true facts regarding the unlawful
payments that JPMorgan made to secure its position as lead
underwriter for the warrants and swap provider for the county,
Assured never would have issued the policies,&#8221; the lawsuit
said. 
Assured Guaranty is the second bond insurer to sue JPMorgan
over a $3 billion refinancing of sewer debt that collapsed
during the credit crisis and almost bankrupted the county.
Syncora Guaranty Inc. sued JPMorgan and thee county on April 29
alleging they fraudulently obtained more than $1 billion in
insurance coverage for the sewer bonds. 
Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call and e-mail seeking comment. 
JPMorgan arranged the refinancing of the Jefferson County
sewer system in 2002 and 2003, converting the district&#8217;s fixed-
rate debt -- issued so the sewer system was able to comply with
a 1996 federal consent decree -- into floating-rate bonds. 
The obligations were paired with more than $5 billion of
interest-rate swaps, meant to lock in lower borrowing costs. 
Credit Ratings 
The financing fell apart in 2008 when the companies
guaranteeing the debt lost their top credit ratings because of
losses on unrelated mortgage-backed securities. 
In January 2008 Jefferson County&#8217;s interest costs soared
more than threefold to 10 percent. 
Financial Security Assurance Holdings Inc., which was
acquired by Assured Guaranty in July 2009, provided insurance to
the county, which according to the lawsuit included $352 million
of the sewer bonds and a $26.4 million surety bond. Assured has
paid more than $4 million on the surety bond, the suit said. 
Last year, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a probe
into the sale of bonds and derivatives to Jefferson County. The
SEC sued two former JPMorgan bankers for making undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioner who owned or worked
at local securities firms that didn&#8217;t do any work on the deals. 
One of those friends, William Blount, the former chairman
of a Montgomery, Alabama, broker dealer, pleaded guilty to
paying $241,000 in bribes to former Jefferson County Commission
president Larry Langford. Langford, who later became the mayor
of Birmingham, is serving a 15-year sentence in a federal prison
in Kentucky after being convicted of on bribery and fraud
charges.

Former Walt Disney Co. Chief
Executive Officer Michael Eisner said in a 1999 e-mail that
&#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; was as important to Disney&#8217;s
ABC network as its National Football League deal. 
Eisner, in a second 1999 e-mail also presented today at a
trial, estimated the value of the rights to the game show at
$1 billion and said it would turn ABC around. The e-mails were
introduced as evidence by lawyers for the show&#8217;s creator, which
accuses Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, of cheating
it out of its share of the profit. 
&#8220;Of course we own it and it costs almost nothing,&#8221; Eisner
said in an Aug. 24, 1999, message, shown to the federal court
jury in Riverside, California, by Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer for
Celador International Ltd. &#8220;Sometimes the entertainment
business is just wonderful.&#8221; 
Closely held Celador sued Disney six years ago, alleging
Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television unit broke an implied promise by
failing to negotiate a higher license fee with Disney&#8217;s ABC
television network after the show became a hit. That prevented
Buena Vista from making a bigger profit that it would have had
to share with the creators, according to London-based Celador. 
Eisner&#8217;s e-mails were allowed as evidence because the
former CEO, who left Burbank, California-based Disney in 2005,
is out of the country and can&#8217;t testify at the trial. The
creators seek more than $200 million in damages for the network
run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; as well as $16 million for merchandising.

Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s failure to deliver
a tablet-friendly version of Windows is forcing big computer
makers like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. to rely on rival
software to help them keep up with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. 
Windows 7, the most recent version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating
system, is too unwieldy for an iPad-like device, said David Daoud, an analyst at IDC. A lighter edition won&#8217;t be ready until
the fourth quarter, giving Apple almost a year&#8217;s head start in
the burgeoning market for tablets. 
&#8220;The Windows world needs to respond,&#8221; said Daoud, whose
firm is based in Framingham, Massachusetts. &#8220;They will have to
play catch-up.&#8221; 
The iPad&#8217;s success caught much of the PC industry by
surprise. Within two months of the April 3 release, Apple sold 2
million iPads -- more than IDC expected for the entire tablet
industry in 2010. To catch up, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are
turning to Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. Taiwanese
manufacturers that build most of the world&#8217;s PCs said they&#8217;re
dissatisfied with Microsoft&#8217;s current lineup. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any choice for now,&#8221; said Joseph Hsu,
chairman and president of Taipei-based manufacturer Micro-Star
International Co., a maker of laptops and computer parts.
Windows 7 is too powerful and consumes too much energy from
batteries, he said. 
The iPad, which can display books, videos and the Internet
on a thin touch screen, will reach sales of 5.5 million units
this year and jump to 13 million next year, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. 
&#8216;Feedback Is Fair&#8217; 
John Kalkman, a vice president in the Microsoft division
that works with computer makers, said the feedback from PC
manufacturers is &#8220;fair.&#8221; Later this year, Microsoft will
release Windows Embedded Compact 7, which will require less
processing power and reduces the drain on batteries. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has tried for more
than a decade to build a market for tablet-sized personal
computers. Chairman Bill Gates predicted in November 2001 that
the tablet would become the most popular form of PC within five
years. 
Demand for the Windows tablets currently sold by Hewlett-
Packard and Dell has been lackluster, according to IDC. Before
the iPad made its debut this year, the researcher had been
forecasting that sales of tablets would decline to less than 1
percent of the overall PC market in the U.S. IDC had predicted
total shipments of just 523,000 tablets.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
American International Group Inc. representatives will appear at
the next hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission as
the panel explores the role of derivatives in the credit crunch. 
The hearing will be held June 30 and July 1 in Washington,
the FCIC said today in a statement on its website. 
AIG was bailed out by the U.S. in 2008 after collateral
calls from Wall Street firms including New York-based Goldman
Sachs on contracts tied to subprime mortgages. Derivatives have
been blamed by lawmakers and investor Warren Buffett for
bringing the financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008. 
The panel, led by former California Treasurer Phil Angelides, will also call witnesses from the U.S. Commodity

OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia&#8217;s
largest mobile phone company, raised $750 million in the biggest
dollar-bond sale by an emerging-market company in almost two
months. 
The 10-year notes were priced at par to yield 8.625
percent, or 531.7 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That compares to a spread of
440 basis points for seven-year, 8 percent dollar bonds the
company sold in January 2005, the last time it tapped
international debt markets. The yield on MTS&#8217;s dollar bonds due
January 2012 surged 220 basis points to 6.116 percent between
April 16 and June 7. The bonds are yielding 5.601 percent today,
a monthly low. 
The sale is the largest offering of dollar debt by a
Russian company since the government sold $5.5 billion of debt
two months ago to set a benchmark that would help develop the
corporate debt market. Yields on emerging-market bonds have
climbed since then on concern the European Union&#8217;s debt crisis
will spread. MTS is the first developing-market company to hold
a bond sale of more than $500 million since April, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8216;Pocket of Cash&#8217; 
&#8220;With longer-term financing unavailable on the domestic
market we believe a limited portion of our debt portfolio should
be in hard currencies providing longer tenure,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer Alexei Kornya said in an e-mailed response to questions
from Bloomberg. &#8220;Any deal around $1 billion with tenure of 10
years extends the average maturity of our debt outstanding by
one year.&#8221; The company seeks to limit the share of foreign-
currency debt to no more than 30 percent, he said. 
MTS sold 60 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) of domestic bonds
between June 2008 and July 2009, according to Bloomberg data, in
a bid to limit its foreign-currency exposure. The company
earlier said the funds raised will be used to refinance its
debt, including a $400 million bond due in October. 
&#8220;There is still ample perception that Russia telecoms are
in a pocket of cash liquidity, which explains their easy access
to the markets, even under shaky risk aversion conditions,&#8221;
said Luis Costa, an emerging market debt strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in London. &#8220;There is hidden liquidity out there to invest
in cash-rich corporations.&#8221; 
Domestic Funding 
The company&#8217;s debt is rated Ba2, two levels below
investment grade, by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and an equivalent
BB at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. The bond sale was organized by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. 
&#8220;Russian companies are able to issue on international
markets again, but they are not in a rush given attractive
funding alternatives domestically&#8221; said Mikhail Galkin, an
analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow. &#8220;MTS will be a rare issuer of
dollar debt going forward as its financial strategy suggests
debt should be mainly in local currency.&#8221;

The Securities and Exchange
Commission pressed JPMorgan Chase  Co. to tell investors more
about mounting demands to buy back defective mortgages, an
obligation that cost the four biggest U.S. lenders about $5
billion last year. 
The SEC asked the New York-based company to disclose more
about reserves set aside to cover the cost of repurchasing bad
loans it sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors,
according to a Jan. 29 letter released today. The SEC also told
the bank to provide more details on when and how it recognizes
losses on mortgages that have been modified as well as on soured
credit-card debt. 
&#8220;What they&#8217;re asking for is a lot more than the banks put
out in the public domain right now,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a
bank analyst at Torrance, California-based Institutional Risk
Analytics. &#8220;This is going to make life uncomfortable for a lot
of the banks, because once they start mandating this kind of
disclosures, it&#8217;s going to stay.&#8221; 
Lenders that sell mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
have to provide warranties assuring that the loans conformed to
the agencies&#8217; standards. With more loans going bad, the
government-sponsored companies are demanding that banks turn
over loan files so they can scour the records for missing
documentation, inaccurate data and fraud, information that can
be used to force loan buybacks. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, seized by federal regulators in
September 2008, asked the bank to repurchase $2.7 billion in
defective loans in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008, JPMorgan said.
The lender held $2 billion in reserves at the end of the first
quarter against future buyback requests. 
Defective Loans 
Of the total requested, JPMorgan repurchased $1.1 billion
in defective loans in 2009 and has offered more than 750,000
borrowers trial modifications to try to &#8220;cure&#8221; their
delinquent loans, JPMorgan said in a separate filing. About
127,000 received permanent repayment plans. The bank&#8217;s mortgage
portfolio swelled to $292.6 billion from $115.8 billion from
2006 through 2008. The company&#8217;s response to the SEC sheds new
light on the company&#8217;s worst-performing loans made during the
housing boom. 
In requesting the information, SEC staff told JPMorgan
Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh that their comments and
the company&#8217;s response &#8220;do not foreclose the commission from
taking any action with respect to the filing.&#8221; The SEC
concluded its review of JPMorgan&#8217;s loan-loss disclosures, which
the bank included in a Jan. 15 securities filing, on May 3. SEC
spokesman John Heine and JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti
declined to comment. 
More Demands 
Before 2008, demands from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
weren&#8217;t significant, JPMorgan told the SEC in its March 2
response. &#8220;However, beginning in 2008, JPMorgan Chase
experienced a higher volume of demands; these demand volumes
have steadily increased every quarter,&#8221; Corporate Controller
Louis Rauchenberger told the SEC. 
Washington-based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in McLean,
Virginia, may ask U.S. banks to repurchase $17.2 billion in
faulty loans this year, Oppenheimer  Co. analyst Chris Kotowski
estimated. Kotowski said in a June 9 report that U.S. banks
could lose $6 billion this year when those loans are returned
and get marked down to their true value. 
&#8220;It is a problem that will continue to drag on the big
banks to the tune of several hundred million per quarter, but
it&#8217;s not a problem that is mushrooming out of control,&#8221;
Kotowski said. 
Third Parties 
JPMorgan told the SEC that 75 percent of its current
repurchase requests stem from loans originated in 2007 and 2008
and that it is able to file claims against third-party
originators on 40 percent of all repurchase requests. 
The SEC questioned the bank&#8217;s calculations for its
allowance for loan losses, relating to breaches in the
agreements it has with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other
mortgage investors. 
&#8220;Estimating the allowance is highly subjective, and is
further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical
data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors,&#8221;
JPMorgan said.

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, alleged that Mylan Inc., the biggest U.S. generic
pharmaceuticals maker, infringed three patents for Sutent, a
drug used to treat cancerous tumors of the digestive tract and
kidneys. 
Pfizer&#8217;s lawsuit contends Mylan violated its patent rights
by filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to market copies of Sutent before the patents
expire, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware. 
&#8220;Sutent has annual sales of about $1 billion&#8221; and
&#8220;Pfizer will suffer irreparable injury&#8221; unless the
infringement is stopped, the company&#8217;s lawyers said in court
papers. 
In April, New York-based Pfizer said it halted a study of
Sutent as a treatment for advanced liver cancer after observing
complications in test patients. The company said it will
continue studying Sutent&#8217;s use to fight other types of cancer. 
Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, reported sales of
$5.09 billion last year.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s painkiller Celebrex
causes less bleeding and fewer ulcers in the gastrointestinal
tract than a combination of generic pain pills and heartburn
drugs, a company-funded study found. 
Arthritis patients taking Celebrex were four times less
likely to start bleeding anywhere from the stomach to the colon
than those given the generic pain drug diclofenac and
AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec, a heartburn medicine that reduces
acid production. The six-month study was presented today at the
Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in Rome and
published in The Lancet. 
Because chronic use of traditional painkillers is linked to
ulcers, doctors recommend either Celebrex or combination
treatment for arthritis patients who need regular treatment.
While previous studies showed they have similar effects on the
stomach, this is the first to examine the entire digestive
tract. The findings should be taken into account when
prescribing pain treatment for arthritis sufferers, the
researchers said. 
The study &#8220;has provided new data relevant to patients
requiring anti-inflammatory therapy,&#8221; said the researchers, led
by Francis K.L. Chan from the department of medicine at Prince
of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. 
The results come from one of two studies New York-based
Pfizer is counting on to boost sales of Celebrex. The drug never
fully recovered after the product&#8217;s main rival, Merck  Co.&#8217;s
Vioxx, was pulled off the market because of its ties to heart
attacks in 2004. Celebrex sales peaked at $3.3 billion that
year. The drug generated $2.4 billion in 2009. 
Too Short 
The scientists tracked 4,484 patients with osteoarthritis
or rheumatoid arthritis who were at risk for developing ulcers
or other gastrointestinal problems. After six months, 0.9
percent on Celebrex and 3.8 percent given the pain and heartburn
combination developed bleeding, ulcers or anemia. More patients
getting the combination dropped out of the study because of side
effects. 
The short duration of the study limits its usefulness,
since arthritis patients tend to take the drugs for years, Elham
Rahme and Sasha Bernatsky from McGill University Health Center
in Montreal, wrote in a Lancet editorial.

Pfizer Inc. faces a Texas trial over
its hormone-replacement drugs after a court overseeing lawsuits
over the medicines sent 200 cases back to their home courts. 
A judge in Galveston, Texas, last week set a May 2011 trial
date for Karen Zahn&#8217;s claims against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit. Zahn
says in her suit that the Prempro menopause drug helped cause
her breast cancer. It&#8217;s one of the first of more than 8,000
lawsuits over the medicine consolidated in federal court in
Arkansas to be returned for trial, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said. 
U.S. District Judge William Wilson in Little Rock,
Arkansas, is supervising pretrial proceedings in the cases
against Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn, another Pfizer unit. He
returned the 200 cases to their courts in March and told lawyers
to get another 400 ready to be sent back later this year. 
&#8220;Pfizer is now going to have to gear up and hire lawyers
all over the country to try these cases,&#8221; said Carl Tobias, a
professor at the University of Richmond law school who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. &#8220;That makes things more expensive and
may provide some incentive to settle.&#8221; 
More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study concluded they posed
an increased breast-cancer risk. 
Menopause Medicines 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. 
Officials of New York-based Pfizer said while Wilson has
sent back some cases, he refused plaintiffs&#8217; requests to send
back all the suits at one time. 
&#8220;No decision has been made about how many additional cases
will be remanded or when,&#8221; Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in
an e-mailed statement. It also isn&#8217;t clear how many of the
remanded cases will go to trial, he added. 
For example, plaintiffs May 25 dismissed a case filed by
Linda Cardwell that Wilson sent back to a federal court in
Alexandria, Virginia, Loder noted. 
Both sides still must exchange case-specific information on
the remanded claims, Loder said. Pfizer lawyers also may ask
judges to throw some cases out. 
Wilson is overseeing cases as part of the multidistrict
litigation system, which allows suits filed in courts around the
U.S. to be consolidated before a single judge for pretrial
hearings. 
Saving on Expenses 
Once pretrial information exchanges are done, the cases are
sent back to the courts where they were originally filed for
trial. Consolidation cuts down on expenses for both sides. 
Such consolidations often lead to so-called global
settlements of litigations over drugs. In 2000, Wyeth agreed to
a $3.76 billion accord to resolve suits over its fen-phen diet
combination after the cases were consolidated before a federal
judge in Philadelphia. 
Loder refused to comment on whether Pfizer will seek to
settle the remaining Prempro cases before Wilson. The company
faces at least 8,000 Prempro claims, Wyeth officials said in a
2009 regulatory filing. 
&#8220;Pfizer will continue to vigorously defend its hormone
therapy medicines,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;We do not comment
on the number of cases pending, nor do we comment on our legal
strategy.&#8221; 
13,000 Cases 
Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for women suing over the menopause
drugs, said she expects to have many of the 200 cases set for
trial within the next 12 months. She estimates there may be more
than 13,000 Prempro cases pending before Wilson and state court
judges in Philadelphia. 
&#8220;Most of the hard work has been done on these cases, and
it&#8217;s time for women to get their days in court,&#8221; she said. 
Littlepage represents Zahn, a retired school receptionist
from Manvel, Texas. The 57-year-old woman took Prempro for
almost three years starting in January 1999. She was diagnosed
with breast cancer in November 2002. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston on June 9 set
the trial of Zahn&#8217;s suit in Galveston for next May 16,
Littlepage said. 
Wyeth has lost seven out of the 11 jury trials over the
menopause drugs. The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown
out at the post-trial stage and or had awards reduced. 
3,000 Cases Dismissed 
Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, Loder said. 
A judge in Philadelphia refused last month to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in 2003
as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. 
Upjohn has lost all three cases juries have considered over
Provera. A Pennsylvania judge ruled last month the Pfizer unit
deserved a new trial in a 2007 case that ended with a $1.5
million jury award. 
The case is In Re Prempro Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Little
Rock).

General Motors Co. board member Kent Kresa, who served as interim chairman during the automaker&#8217;s
bankruptcy, will retire as a director as soon as July, said two
people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Kresa, who joined the board in 2003, turned 72 in March and
will not stand for re-election, said the people, who asked not
to be identified revealing internal discussions. GM added a 13th
director, Cynthia Telles, an associate clinical professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles, in April and she will
take Kresa&#8217;s place when he retires, the people said. 
The departure would leave four directors from the old
General Motors Corp. and eight who joined since the new GM
emerged from bankruptcy. That may help GM convince potential
investors its board has a fresh perspective as it prepares for
an initial stock sale, said Charles Elson, director of the John
L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of
Delaware. 
&#8220;New blood would probably make some sense,&#8221; said Elson. 
Kathryn Marinello, another director, tendered her
resignation from GM&#8217;s board after she left her last job as
chairman and CEO of Minneapolis-based human resources firm
Ceridian Corp. in January. GM&#8217;s corporate governance guidelines
state that when a director&#8217;s job changes &#8220;from the position he
or she held when originally invited to join the board, the
director will tender a letter of resignation.&#8221;

Five years ago, investors
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Carlyle Group put up
$500 million in seed money to hunt for oil in the deep waters
of the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. 
After the BP Plc oil spill, smaller Gulf operators such
as the Goldman startup, Cobalt International Energy Inc., may
be swept up in a wave of consolidation as the regulatory
landscape tilts in favor of larger firms, said William Herbert, an analyst at Houston-based Simmons  Co. 
Tougher rules are likely to boost costs and slow the
pace of drilling, said Scott Van Bergh, co-head of Americas
energy and power investment banking at Bank of America Corp.
Companies may also face higher liability caps and
requirements to post some clean-up costs in advance. That may
make drilling in the Gulf feasible for only the world&#8217;s
largest energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Total
SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Norway&#8217;s Statoil ASA and
Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd. 
The rules Congress enacts &#8220;are likely to favor larger
operators over smaller ones,&#8221; Van Bergh said. &#8220;People are
thinking about who will want to exit, and who will want to
become consolidators.&#8221; 
BHP Firepower 
Cobalt, founded in Houston in 2005 by the former
president of Unocal Corp., Joseph Bryant, operates in the
deep waters of the Gulf and the West African coast and went
public last year. The shares lost about 44 percent since the
spill on April 20, giving Cobalt a market value of about $2.8
billion. 
Houston-based Plains Exploration  Production Co., with
a market value of about $3.3 billion, and Cobalt may be
targets for BHP, the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
according to a report last month by Deutsche Bank AG analysts. 
BHP already has four operating energy projects in the
Gulf, three of which are joint ventures with BP. The
Melbourne-based company has the &#8220;firepower to do enormous
things,&#8221; J. Michael Yeager, the chief executive officer of
BHP&#8217;s petroleum unit, said on a May 24 conference call. 
BHP is capable of spending as much as $20 billion to
acquire Gulf assets, including BP project stakes that may come
up for sale, Citigroup Inc. Sydney-based analyst Clarke Wilkins
said in an interview today. 
&#8216;Public Enemy&#8217; 
&#8220;BP is public enemy number one in the U.S. at the moment,
and if there is any forced divestment of assets, BHP is in a
strong position to be able to pick them up,&#8221; Wilkins said. 
BHP, a partner with BP in the Atlantis, Mad Dog and
Gunflint ventures, may increase its stakes in those projects, he
said. BP&#8217;s share of those assets is worth $11 billion, Wilkins
estimated in a June 16 report. 
Amanda Buckley, a spokeswoman for BHP, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation. Cobalt spokesman Rich Smith
didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. Andrea Raphael of
Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did a spokesman for
Riverstone Holdings LLC, which sponsors a fund with Carlyle
that invested in Cobalt. Spokespeople for Plains didn&#8217;t
return calls. 
The oil and gas business is one of the busier sectors in
a slumping merger market this year, accounting for $68.8
billion of deals, or about 8.4 percent of the total across
all industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil
and gas deals accounted for 5.9 percent of global takeovers
during the previous decade. 
&#8216;Buoyant Market&#8217; 
Energy mergers and acquisitions may produce a &#8220;buoyant
market&#8221; in 2010, according to Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. 
Still, it may be months or years before Gulf players get
a clear enough understanding of the new regulatory
environment to do deals, said Bank of America&#8217;s Van Bergh. 
The U.S. Justice Department has begun a probe into the
BP oil leak, and President Barack Obama put a six-month ban
on offshore drilling. Congress is also considering removing
the $75 million limit on economic losses from oil spills that
large companies must pay. BP agreed this week to set up a $20
billion fund to pay victims and the spill had cost it more
than $1.2 billion as of June 11. 
&#8220;Costs will go up to operate in the region and that
could make it quite difficult for smaller companies,&#8221; said
Peter Chilton, an investment analyst at Sydney-based
Constellation Capital Management Ltd. 
Anadarko, Noble 
The changing economics of deep-water drilling have
prompted investor doubts about one $2.7 billion deal struck
just before the spill. Mariner Energy Inc. shares dropped
about 7.7 percent since the spill amid concern an agreed sale
to Apache Corp. may unravel. Apache is committed to
completing the deal and expects to do so after getting
regulatory and shareholder approval, probably in the third
quarter, said spokesman Bill Mintz. 
It&#8217;s too early to say how the BP spill will affect
Total&#8217;s plans for exploration, said Phenelope Semavoine, a
spokeswoman for Total in Paris. Alan Jeffers of Exxon Mobil
and Paula Almada of Petrobras declined to comment. Ola Morten Aanestad, a Statoil spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment. 
&#8220;Today the industry is focused very much on the spill
itself, but we believe that many are thinking about what the
longer-term implications will be as an operator in the deep-
water Gulf,&#8221; said Bank of America&#8217;s Van Bergh. 
Anadarko, Noble 
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Noble Energy Inc. are among
companies that may opt to sell their deep-water Gulf assets,
according to Simmons&#8217;s Herbert. Anadarko, which owns a stake
in BP&#8217;s leaking well, has dropped 43 percent since the spill.
Houston-based Noble, which got about 10 percent of 2009
production from the deep-water Gulf, is down 15 percent. 
Anadarko said on June 3 it may shift capital spending to
projects outside the Gulf. The Woodlands, Texas-based company
got about a fourth of its production from the Gulf in 2009,
according to a regulatory filing. Spokesmen for Anadarko and
Noble declined to comment. 
&#8220;The risk premium for deep-water, highly pressured
reserves has gone up,&#8221; Herbert said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a seller&#8217;s
market.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp., a sponsor of this week&#8217;s U.S. Open golf tournament, is
counting on Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and the rest of the
world&#8217;s top golfers to showcase its Web technology. 
The company developed a smartphone app that lets users
track the tournament and players&#8217; statistics. It even shows a
so-called heat map of the course in Pebble Beach, California,
revealing the most challenging holes. IBM also helps manage
security, video and other features for the U.S. Open&#8217;s website. 
IBM&#8217;s strategy isn&#8217;t about reaching more golf-loving
consumers. Instead, it wants to show business customers how its
technology can handle a huge surge in traffic without breaking
the bank. While the number of people using the U.S. Open site
jumped from a year earlier, IBM was able to cut the cost per
user by 25 percent, said John Kent, program manager for the
company&#8217;s sponsorship marketing. 
&#8220;When we talk to our customers about that, they have the
very same issues,&#8221; Kent said. 
IBM declined to say how much it spends on the U.S. Open or
what kind of return it gets from the event. The Armonk, New
York-based company also sponsors the Masters Golf Tournament, as
well as the U.S. Open tennis match and Wimbledon. 
IBM fell 83 cents to $130.15 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The shares are little changed this year. 
IPad Version 
This is the second year in a row that IBM has offered an
iPhone app for the U.S. Open. About 286,000 people downloaded
the software last year. This time around, it also runs on Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad and other smartphones such as the Droid. IBM already
had 150,000 downloads by the first day of play. 
The software gives up-to-the-minute scores and data for
each competitor, and the map indicates whether players are
shooting above or below par on each hole. The website also has
high-definition coverage of the tournament. 
IBM invites corporate customers to see its Web operations
up close by visiting a trailer near the course. A staff of more
than a dozen, supplied with Twizzlers and a mini-fridge filled
with energy drinks, monitors global Internet security threats
and viewership numbers. 
&#8220;Our clients love golf,&#8221; said Rick Singer, IBM&#8217;s vice
president for client executive marketing. &#8220;These relationships
are all about business, and how we can further the perception of
IBM, and really sell stuff.&#8221; 
On the first day of the tournament, the heat map showed the
difficulty of the Pebble Beach course, which is located about
two hours from San Francisco. Woods and Mickelson, the world&#8217;s
two best golfers, failed to make a single birdie -- a score
that&#8217;s one stroke under par -- during the opening round. 
Inside IBM&#8217;s trailer, the heat map was displayed on a 52-
inch flat screen. Kent pointed to a red blob where players were
performing better than expected. 
&#8220;It looks like six is the only &#8216;easy&#8217; hole out there,&#8221; he
said.

Pfizer Inc. will withdraw its blood
cancer drug Mylotarg after 10 years on the U.S. market because
studies didn&#8217;t prove it works and the treatment was linked to
deaths from liver and lung complications. 
Mylotarg, for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, is the first
medicine to be pulled off the market that was cleared through
the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s accelerated approval program,
the agency said today in a statement. Pfizer volunteered to halt
sales after trial results raised safety concerns &#8220;and the drug
failed to demonstrate clinical benefit,&#8221; the FDA said. 
Mylotarg was approved in 2000 based on preliminary data
showing improved remission rates, with a requirement for more
complete trials to prove it extended survival. Wyeth, which sold
Mylotarg before being purchased by Pfizer in October, didn&#8217;t
start mandated follow-up research until 2004 and didn&#8217;t provide
results until this year. 
&#8220;Accelerated approval still has a place in the approval
process but it&#8217;s also more important that we learn over the
years that the whole development plan be set up well in
advance,&#8221; said Robert Kane, acting deputy director for safety
in the FDA&#8217;s Division of Hematology Products, in a phone
interview today. &#8220;The trials should be planned and if possible
under way when the sponsor submits the application.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the

failed to win bankruptcy court permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn in Jacksonville,
Florida, today denied Goldman&#8217;s request to lift the automatic
stay, a part of the bankruptcy code that shields a company from
creditors&#8217; efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs
Mortgage is a division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in Ponte Vedra
Beach by RQB Resort LP and RQB Development. New York-based
Goldman Sachs, owed about $192.5 million as of Jan. 10, hasn&#8217;t
been paid since August. 
The property, purchased in 2006, was valued at $135.3
million in an appraisal ordered by Goldman. David J. O&#8217;Halloran,
chief executive officer for RQB&#8217;s U.S. operation, told the court
the group believes the resort should be valued in the
$90 million to $100 million range. 
RQB Resort listed assets and debt of as much as $500
million each in Chapter 11 documents filed March 1 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. RQB Development also sought
protection. 
RQB sought and received a six-month extension of the
exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. The new deadline
is Dec. 29.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s appeal of a verdict for an Arkansas woman who
blamed the company&#8217;s menopause drugs for her breast cancer,
leaving intact a $2.7 million award that may grow with punitive
damages. 
The justices today let stand a lower court decision
upholding that award, which marked the first federal verdict
against Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement
treatment. 
The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit sought to
leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a
new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27
million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all
aspects of the case, including the jury&#8217;s finding that the drugs
helped cause Donna Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. 
&#8220;While we are disappointed with the court&#8217;s decision, it
does not change the prior ruling by the appeals court, which
affirmed the dismissal of punitive damages as to Upjohn and
ordered a new trial on punitive damages for Wyeth,&#8221; Pfizer said
in a statement. 
Scroggin was among 6 million women who took the pills to
treat menopause symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and
mood swings. Wyeth faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the
medicines, which are still on the market. 
Scroggin and other women contend company executives ignored
studies raising questions about the link between hormone-
replacement drugs and breast cancer to pump up sales of their
drugs. 
Health Risks 
The Supreme Court action &#8220;validates our evidence that
shows Wyeth hid the health risks of this drug and the drugs
caused breast cancer in thousands of women,&#8221; Jim Morris,
Scroggin&#8217;s lawyer, said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;We are
looking forward to asking another jury to decide the extent of
Wyeth&#8217;s wrongful conduct.&#8221; 
Scroggin took three menopause drugs: Provera, a progestin-
laden treatment made by what is now Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit;
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug made by Wyeth, and Prempro, a
combination of the two other drugs introduced by Wyeth in 1996. 
Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs topped $2
billion before a 2002 study sponsored by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health suggested women using the medicines had a
higher breast cancer risk. New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, bought Wyeth last year in a $68 billion
transaction. 
Jury&#8217;s Decision 
The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision not to review the case isn&#8217;t
surprising since the appellate court left the jury&#8217;s decisions
on liability and actual damages undisturbed, said Carl Tobias, a
professor at University of Richmond Law School who teaches
classes on mass-tort law. 
The denial &#8220;is a good sign for plaintiffs going forward&#8221;
with Prempro claims, Tobias said today in an e-mail. 
Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases that have been
considered by juries since the cases began going to trial in
2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out at the post-
trial stage and or had awards reduced. 
Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases have been set for
trials, said Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman. 
Pfizer&#8217;s appeal in the Scroggin case centered on the
Constitution&#8217;s Seventh Amendment, which guarantees the right to
a jury trial in federal civil cases. In a separate line of
argument, the company contended that the trial judge should have
excluded the testimony of an oncologist who testified that the
hormone treatments caused Scroggin&#8217;s cancer. 
Pfizer shares fell 11 cents to $15.10 at 4:00 p.m. New York
time. After the headlines were published, Pfizer shares fell as
much as 2.4 percent, from an opening high of $15.38 to an
afternoon low of $15.01. 
The case is Wyeth v. Scroggin, 09-1123.

strongly believe in the broadband wireless market and especially
in Italy, where only a wireless solution can really solve
internet access issues.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs and Icon, whose group owns about 60 percent
of Aria, are pitted against a bid from a team led by minority
shareholder Gilo Ventures, according to three people with
knowledge of the talks. Icon&#8217;s group is offering around 100
million euros ($124 million), said one of the people, who
declined to be identified before the acquisition is agreed. 
AriaDSL, the Dutch parent of the Italian Wimax operator,
was declared bankrupt on March 2. The struggle for control of
the company began six months earlier after it hit a &#8220;liquidity
shortage,&#8221; according court papers filed in April by the
bankruptcy trustee, who is seeking a buyer for the company. 
Officials for Goldman in London declined to comment. Davidi Gilo, founder of Gilo Ventures, also declined to comment. 
In December, most shareholders agreed to short-term funding
through a convertible bond that would be sold in three stages.
The investment would have given the company access to a 75
million-euro bank loan, the court papers show, cash that would
have been invested to build more base stations, the people said. 
Financing Fails 
A conflict among shareholders led that shareholder
financing to fail, the court documents show. Only the first of
the three payments was made and a number of shareholders, which
the documents don&#8217;t identify, requested that AriaDSL pay back
the loan. The shareholders sought the bankruptcy after failing
to get their money back, the documents show. 
Goldman and Icon&#8217;s interest Aria in began in 2008 when they
led a group that injected 55 million euros into AriaDSL to help
it fund a 48 million-euro purchase of six Wimax licenses, court
papers show. Goldman was involved through both its asset
management unit and its special situations group, which mainly
invests in distressed assets. 
As part of the license agreement, Aria pledged to build 700
base stations by Nov. 1. To boost its reach, in June 2009 Aria
and Telecom Italia SpA said Aria would use Telecom Italia&#8217;s
Wimax frequencies in Italy&#8217;s central and southern regions. In
exchange, Telecom Italia agreed to sell Aria&#8217;s broadband
services to its own clients. By April, Aria had built only about
120 base stations and the company isn&#8217;t likely to meet its
licensing target, according to the court documents. 
For Icon, Aria remains a long-term project. 
&#8220;We look at investments on a four-to-five year horizon and
the same here,&#8221; said Icon&#8217;s Dmitriev. &#8220;We have good experience
with Wimax in Russia and Ukraine, so we can use our scale of
operations to buy equipment cheaper.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. accused
Barclays Plc of misleading a federal judge when it bought Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s defunct brokerage in the falling
markets of September 2008, said a Lehman lawyer, citing a letter
from JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon. 
Barclays Group Chief Executive John Varley was asked by
Lehman lawyer Robert Gaffey in federal court in Manhattan today
about what he characterized as &#8220;two big-time bankers in a very
big dispute.&#8221; 
Gaffey said Dimon wrote to Varley and Barclays President
Robert Diamond, saying the court was misinformed about the
Barclays deal. JPMorgan had asked Barclays to participate in an
accounting of the transaction and they declined, Dimon said in
the letter, according to Gaffey. 
&#8220;I could refute him point by point but he&#8217;s not here,&#8221;
Varley said. &#8220;I inwardly groaned when I read it because I knew
that there were a number of points on which Jamie Dimon and I
would disagree.&#8221; 
Varley was the second witness today in a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court trial over Lehman&#8217;s claim that the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest
bank should pay it as much as $11 billion for an allegedly
undisclosed &#8220;windfall&#8221; on the deal for the brokerage. The
purchase was approved by Judge James Peck and closed a week
after Lehman&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S.
history. 
Custodial Account 
JPMorgan around that time had taken $7 billion out of a
Barclays custodial account, according to Varley. 
&#8220;I was deeply unhappy that without our consent a large
amount of money had been taken out of our account,&#8221; Varley
said. He interpreted the letter about misleading the court as a
device by JPMorgan to distract attention from the dispute over
money, he said. 
Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the dispute, which was later settled. 
Separately, Lehman in May sued JPMorgan to recover tens of
billions of dollars in &#8220;lost value,&#8221; accusing the bank of
precipitating its downfall and preventing it from winding down
in an orderly fashion. Evangelisti said the lawsuit was &#8220;ill
conceived.&#8221; 
Earlier, Varley said the week when Barclays bought the
Lehman brokerage was &#8220;the riskiest week of my life.&#8221; 
&#8220;Markets were collapsing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We needed to ensure
there was a buffer between assets and liabilities. We needed to
be able to look regulators in the eye and say the deal would be
capital accretive.&#8221; 
Protect Our Ratios 
&#8220;This was a time when there was a great deal of focus by
supervisors around the world, including the U.K. Financial
Services Authority and the Bank of England, on capital ratios,
and it was clear to me that the only circumstances in which I
could look our regulators in the eye, and indeed look our
shareholders in the eye, would be if we were able to protect our
capital ratios,&#8221; Varley said. 
&#8220;To put it another way, were we not capable of doing that,
then I was not prepared to recommend that we should proceed to
the board&#8221; of Barclays, he said. 
Lehman lawyer Gaffey has tried to prove that Barclays made
a safe, or &#8220;derisked&#8221; acquisition, and took more assets out of
the defunct firm than it should have without telling the court. 
&#8220;You expected an immediate profit&#8221; on the brokerage
purchase? Gaffey asked. 
&#8220;Yes we did,&#8221; Varley said. &#8220;That&#8217;s because we expected
the income we generated to exceed costs.&#8221; 
BofA Balked 
Today&#8217;s first witness, Barclays President Diamond, said the
bank had qualms about acquiring Lehman&#8217;s brokerage after Bank of
America Corp. balked at buying it. 
&#8220;BofA walked away from an opportunity to do a deal with
Lehman at some distressed price,&#8221; said Diamond, who runs
Barclays&#8217;s corporate and investment banking operations. &#8220;But
they paid $50 billion for Merrill Lynch. That created real
concern for us. What had they seen?&#8221; 
Diamond was responding to questions from Barclays&#8217;s lawyer
David Boies about the bank&#8217;s concerns when it bought Lehman and
why it sought to buffer itself from risk by staking claim to
assets in the brokerage business. 
&#8220;BofA could have bought it for about $1 billion,&#8221; Diamond
said. &#8220;They walked away and paid $50 billion for Merrill. It
reinforced in Varley and myself and our board what a risky
environment we were working in.&#8221; 
Government Help 
&#8220;When JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns it got government
help,&#8221; Diamond said. &#8220;Barclays wasn&#8217;t able to get help. So it
was especially important to get the values and commitments we
had received or we couldn&#8217;t go forward. There were hours when we
were expecting not to execute on the deal.&#8221; 
Lehman, which wants money to pay off creditors, has accused
the London-based bank of making a &#8220;secret&#8221; asset raid on
Lehman that wasn&#8217;t disclosed to the court. The brokerage&#8217;s
trustee, James Giddens, has said changes were secretly inserted
in the sale contract without notice to him or Lehman&#8217;s lawyers.
He wants $6.7 billion from Barclays to pay hedge funds and other
institutional clients of Lehman. 
Lehman&#8217;s lawyers are beginning to wrap up their case after
more than two weeks of testimony by former Lehman executives,
advisers and Barclays officials. 
The U.K. bank&#8217;s lawyers have tried to show when questioning
Lehman&#8217;s witnesses that all the key facts of the deal were known
by the main players. They are scheduled to present Barclays&#8217;s
side of the story starting Aug. 23. Barclays, which announced a
gain on its purchase on Sept. 17, 2008, has said it owes Lehman
nothing and wants $3 billion that is being withheld by the
trustee. 
Lehman spent $794 million on lawyers, advisers and managers
in 19 months through April, with $277.4 million going to Lehman
CEO Bryan Marsal&#8217;s restructuring firm, Alvarez  Marsal. Marsal
has said he will spend five years selling assets to pay
unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the dollar. Any
proceeds from litigation would add to the payout. 
The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Jamie Dimon, the chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., named longtime associate Heidi Miller to the new post of president of JPMorgan International as
part of a management shuffle to groom an eventual successor. 
Miller, 57, who had been executive vice president for
Treasury and Securities Services, will be replaced by Chief
Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh, 44. Doug Braunstein, 49,
head of Investment Banking Americas, will succeed Cavanagh as
CFO, the company said in a statement today. 
Dimon, 54, said in March that he planned to rotate senior
executives across business lines as part of a succession plan.
Miller&#8217;s working relationship with Dimon spans about two
decades, including stints at Travelers Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Bank One Corp. and JPMorgan. 
&#8220;This is someone who has the capability of staring Jamie
Dimon down, so that&#8217;s obviously served her well,&#8221; said Duff
McDonald, author of &#8220;Last Man Standing: The Ascent of Jamie
Dimon and JPMorgan Chase.&#8221; &#8220;The fact that he&#8217;s chosen her to
take on this new and expanded role should surprise nobody.&#8221; 
The move gives Cavanagh, who has never run a business
division at JPMorgan, operational experience as a possible
successor to Dimon, McDonald said. Cavanagh worked with Dimon at
Primerica and Citigroup before joining Bank One, where Dimon had
become CEO, in 2000. He was named CFO of JPMorgan after Dimon
sold his lender to the bank in 2004. 
Dealmaker 
Braunstein has been one of JPMorgan&#8217;s most prolific
dealmakers for corporate clients. He is also Dimon&#8217;s go-to
banker for his own acquisitions after working across the
negotiating table from him during the Bank One sale. Braunstein
helped JPMorgan seal a deal to buy Bear Stearns Cos. during a
weekend of frenzied negotiating in 2008. The company said it
will announce Braunstein&#8217;s replacement soon. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s grooming multiple potential successors,&#8221; said
Bradley Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein  Co. &#8220;Jamie
hasn&#8217;t made a decision about who&#8217;s going to take over, and he&#8217;s
got time to see how they do in their new roles.&#8221; 
Since 2004, Miller has run JPMorgan&#8217;s Treasury  Securities
Services unit, which provides clients with payment-processing
and cash-management services. 
Miller turned around the business and generated stable
returns throughout the economic crisis, Hintz said. JPMorgan
credited her with producing &#8220;record increases in net revenue
and net income&#8221; during her tenure at the unit, which processes
an average of $3.7 trillion in transfers daily and has $15.3
trillion in assets under custody. 
Competing With Citigroup 
As head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Global Corporate Bank, Miller will
lead the company&#8217;s expansion plans in emerging markets like
China, Brazil, India and Russia, regions where JPMorgan will
battle Citigroup for business, said Anthony Polini, a banking
analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. More than half of
Citigroup&#8217;s total revenue comes from overseas, compared with
about a quarter at JPMorgan, Polini said. 
&#8220;This is a key play to get a piece of the pie that Citi
has a bigger slice of right now,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;The projected
growth rate for those economies are two or three times greater
than the projected growth rates of the U.S.&#8221; 
Shares of JPMorgan, which have fallen 6 percent this year
compared with a 3 percent advance in the SP 500 Financials
Index, were little changed as of 12:53 p.m. in New York trading
at $39.19.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, reduced its price
forecasts for crude oil because commodity markets are
&#8220;fragile&#8221; on concern growth in Europe and China will slow. 
West Texas Intermediate oil, traded in New York, was
forecast at $100 a barrel in 2011, down 9.1 percent from its
previous prediction of $110, Goldman said in a report today. The
bank also downgraded prices for three-month, six-month and 12-
month crude and for Brent oil, traded in London. 
&#8220;Commodity markets are generally rebounding strongly off
their lows but sentiment remains fragile on European and Chinese
concerns,&#8221; said analysts led by New York-based Allison Nathan.
&#8220;Markets will remain fragile until there is further evidence
that sovereign pressures are stabilizing and global trend
economic growth remains intact.&#8221; 
Oil in New York has gained more than 10 percent so far in
June, set for the biggest monthly increase since October, amid
speculation global demand for fuels will recover as Europe
overcomes its debt crisis. Futures yesterday reached a six-week
high of $78.92 a barrel after China, the world&#8217;s second-largest
energy consumer, signaled an end to the yuan&#8217;s fixed rate to the
dollar, a move that may boost the country&#8217;s purchasing power. 
&#8220;We have lowered our three-month oil and base metals price
forecasts but to levels still above current prices, and maintain
a positive medium-term view of key commodities,&#8221; the analysts
said. 
Goldman said the market is &#8220;overestimating&#8221; any negative
impact of government policies on growth and has discounted
possible constraints on oil supply in the future. 
&#8216;Too Bearish&#8217; 
&#8220;Sentiment is too bearish on both the sovereign-debt risks
as well as the effects of macroeconomic momentum slowing,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;Despite some macro slowing, absolute growth
indicators are still firmly positive.&#8221; 
WTI, a low-sulfur crude, is the reference grade for futures
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent is quoted
in oil contracts at the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. 
&#8220;Implied demand for key commodities has remained at
exceptionally high levels in the emerging markets,&#8221; the Goldman
analysts said. &#8220;Developed market demand has generally surprised
to the upside.&#8221; 
WTI contracts for December delivery have gained $3.40 a
barrel since a May 10 buy recommendation, according to the
report. 
Global fuel consumption will increase 2 percent this year
to a record 86.4 million barrels a day, the International Energy
Agency predicted June 10. 
The following tables show Goldman Sach&#8217;s price forecasts
for crude, in dollars a barrel.

Shanghai will have more than half of
Asia&#8217;s stock market liquidity in 2020 as China gradually moves
to full currency convertibility and opens yuan-denominated A
shares to foreign investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. 
&#8220;As a financial centre, we expect Shanghai to develop more
along the lines of the New York model -- that is, primarily
dedicated to its domestic market -- rather than as a regional
financial centre like London or Singapore,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
analysts Christopher Eoyang, Jason Lui and Sunil Koul said in a
research report released today. &#8220;In many ways, we think
Shanghai may partially emulate the development of Hong Kong
during the 1980s and 1990s, when manufacturing was gradually
replaced by higher value added services.&#8221; 
Shanghai currently accounts for 25 percent of the region&#8217;s
daily cash equity and futures turnover, the analysts wrote. The
city will benefit &#8220;disproportionately&#8221; as China&#8217;s financial
markets grow deeper and more sophisticated, they said. 
China&#8217;s central government has a goal of making Shanghai an
international financial center by 2020. The city&#8217;s economy,
which already surpassed Hong Kong&#8217;s in size last year, grew 8.2
percent in 2009. In comparison, New York City&#8217;s expanded 0.9
percent in the fourth quarter after seven straight quarterly
declines. 
Daily Trading 
The Goldman Sachs report comes after the People&#8217;s Bank of
China pledged June 19 to make its currency more flexible, a move
that drove the yuan up by the most since July 2005. The Shanghai
Composite Index climbed 2.9 percent yesterday. U.S. President
Barack Obama said the policy action will &#8220;contribute to a more
balanced global economy.&#8221; 
Goldman forecast that with a gradual liberalization, the
value of equities and futures traded daily in China could reach
$455 billion in 2020, about 70 percent of the regional total, up
from the current $58 billion, or 36 percent of the liquidity in
Asia, according to the report. 
Under the same scenario, trading turnover in Shanghai could
increase to more than $350 billion per day in a decade from the
current $47 billion, Goldman Sachs estimated. That means
Shanghai would account for more than 75 percent of China&#8217;s
liquidity, and as much as 53 percent of Asia&#8217;s, they said. 
&#8220;Despite Shanghai&#8217;s image as a modern commercial centre
and its notable achievements, China&#8217;s equity capital markets are
relatively immature,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &#8220;Although
the government is on the path towards full currency
convertibility and the opening up of the domestic equity market,
the process will probably be very gradual, and this could
potentially benefit Hong Kong.&#8221; 
Ownership of yuan-denominated or A-shares is limited to
Chinese citizens and approved overseas investors under the
qualified foreign institutional investor, or QFII, program. The
analysts estimated current foreign ownership of A shares at
about 0.5 percent of market capitalization, compared to 25
percent in Japan and about 30 percent in Korea and Taiwan.

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said it suspended trials of its experimental pain
relief drug, tanezumab, for osteoarthritis after reports that
patients&#8217; conditions worsened and led to joint replacements. 
Pfizer, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, isn&#8217;t recruiting any new patients or giving the
drug to patients already in 10 osteoarthritis trials or those
with the condition taking the drug in studies for other
diseases, the New York-based company said today in a statement. 
Tanezumab would generate an estimated $100 million in
annual sales by the end of 2012, and $260 million by 2013,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The drug was one of
500 projects the company had preserved in a pared-down
development portfolio. Pfizer said in April 2009 that the drug
as a treatment for the pain of osteoarthritis in the knee had
moved into the third and final stage of testing usually needed
for regulatory approval. 
The FDA asked the company to show data on potential effects
in clinical studies of the drug among patients with cancer pain,
interstitial cystitis, chronic low back pain and painful
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Pfizer said. 
The agency will then decide whether to halt Pfizer&#8217;s
remaining trials of tanezumab after reviewing company data.
Trials for other conditions haven&#8217;t reported similar adverse
events, MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. 





Trials of the Pfizer drug Tanezumab have led to joint replacement. Close

General Motors Co. is preparing for
an initial public offering that may sell 20 percent of the
Treasury&#8217;s stake in the automaker and reduce the U.S. to a
minority owner, said two people familiar with the plan. 
The aim is to sell a fifth of the government&#8217;s 304 million
shares, said the people, who asked not to be identified
revealing private discussions. That would reduce the Treasury
Department&#8217;s stake to less than 50 percent from 61 percent now.
Final decisions on which owners will sell how many shares
haven&#8217;t been made and may change, the people said. 
A registration statement may be filed in August, aiming for
a November stock sale, said four people familiar with the plan.
The sale will probably raise $10 billion to $15 billion,
depending on the company&#8217;s performance, the strength of the
economy and the health of the IPO market, the people said. 
An August filing means Detroit-based GM could have the IPO
ready around the time of the Nov. 2 congressional elections,
said the people. If Treasury can sell enough shares, President
Barack Obama could help other Democrats running for office by
arguing that his administration&#8217;s restructuring of GM is paying
off, said Joe Phillippi, president of AutoTrends Consulting. 
&#8220;The government wants a successful offering soon so they
can say that they took the company through bankruptcy, turned it
over to independent management and are taking it public,&#8221; said
Phillippi, who is based in Short Hills, New Jersey. &#8220;This would
be part of the campaign spin.&#8221; 
Other Sellers 
The automaker may also issue new shares to raise cash and
sell shares owned by Canada and a union-led retiree health-care
trust, one of the people said. 
Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined in an e-mail to
comment on the matter. 
GM has invited analysts, potential investors and
representatives of its current shareholders to Detroit for a
review of the business on June 29, said a spokeswoman, Renee Rashid-Merem. GM will also give the members of the financial
community a look at current and future models, she said. 
The IPO will be managed by JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley, people familiar with the matter have said. They will
collect fees of 0.75 percent of the sale, said a person briefed
on the matter. Such fees would be a quarter of the usual rate
for large stock sales. 
JPMorgan had offered to accept payment in equity instead of
cash, though that idea was rejected by GM and Treasury, two
people said. 
The U.S. will probably sell the remainder of its GM stock
over &#8220;a few years,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said
in a May 17 Bloomberg Television interview. 
Equity Value 
GM&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a May 20
report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan debt analyst who projects a
return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of bonds issued by
GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that will be converted
to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s bond prices, GM&#8217;s
equity is worth about $51 billion. 
Since 1999, four U.S. IPOs have exceeded $5 billion -- Visa
Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal in 2008, ATT Wireless Group&#8217;s
$10.6 billion offering in 2000, Kraft Foods Inc.&#8217;s $8.68 billion
deal in 2001 and United Parcel Service Inc.&#8217;s $5.47 billion sale
in 1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The size of a company&#8217;s IPO may vary from the original
amount listed in its registration statement, known as an S-1
filing, submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission. 
The SEC examines the S-1, which companies use to register
shares they want to sell, to make sure it complies with
disclosure requirements and may ask for amendments to correct or
clarify statements. A company can sell shares once the SEC
declares the registration statement effective. 
The process usually takes 8 to 10 weeks from the time of
the initial S-1 filing to the effective date.

Britain&#8217;s new bank levy will have a
&#8220;minimal&#8221; impact on U.S. investment banks with operations in
London, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. likely to pay only a sixth
of the bill it faces for the bonus tax. 
International banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. may pay about a quarter of the 2 billion-pound ($3
billion) total levy a year, according to analysts at Seymour
Pierce Ltd. and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit
today. The U.K.&#8217;s five biggest banks will pay about 76 percent
of the Treasury forecast for the bank tax, according to Mark Phin, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Ltd. 
&#8220;The impact will be minimal for U.S. investment banks,&#8221;
said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London
with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on New York-based Goldman
Sachs. &#8220;It could impact Goldman by about $100 million per year,
or about 1 percent of earnings. That assumes the industry in
general doesn&#8217;t pass on the cost to customers.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in U.S.
history, has said the U.K.&#8217;s one-time bonus tax will leave it
with a $600 million bill. In December, the U.K. put a one-time
50 percent levy on bankers&#8217; discretionary bonuses. 
Spokeswomen for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in London
declined to comment on the bank levy today. 
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told lawmakers
yesterday the tax will raise about 2 billion pounds annually as
other European governments consider similar taxes to tackle
budget deficits inflated by bank bailouts. The 0.07 percent levy
on wholesale liabilities is less than half the 0.15 percent rate
being considered by the U.S. government. 
The six biggest U.K. banks will pay about 1.5 billion
pounds of the 2 billion pounds forecast, with the remaining 500
million pounds coming from building societies and foreign banks,
Bank of America said today in a note to clients.

Three of the five U.S. banks that
dominate swaps trading already perform most transactions outside
their depository institutions and would face minimal disruption
from a congressional proposal to reorder the derivatives
business, financial statements and banking records show. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. would be hit
hardest by the proposal, crafted by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to wall off swaps desks from commercial banks. JPMorgan
had 98 percent of its $142 billion in current value derivatives
holdings inside its bank in the first quarter of this year while
Citigroup had 89 percent of $112 billion, the records show. 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., each of which
entered the commercial banking business in 2008 in the midst of
the financial crisis, would be less affected. Morgan Stanley
kept just over 1 percent of its $86 billion in derivatives
holdings in its bank in the first quarter, and Goldman Sachs
Group&#8217;s held 32 percent of its $104 billion. Bank of America
Corp., which absorbed broker-dealer Merrill Lynch in 2009, had
33 percent of its $115 billion in its bank. 
Lincoln, a Democrat, contends the swaps-desk measure would
reduce taxpayers&#8217; exposure to risky banking activities. The
banking industry has been lobbying against the idea for weeks,
saying it would drive up costs and send business to foreign
lenders. The trading numbers call into question the extent of
the impact and whether the congressional action would favor one
business model over another. While JPMorgan and Citigroup might
have to spend billions to re-capitalize their trading desks, the
three others might have much smaller costs. 
&#8216;Pick and Choose&#8217; 
&#8220;Any time that Congress tries to pick and choose what
parts of the genie to put back in the bottle, we&#8217;re going to be
creating some pretty strange creatures,&#8221; said Bill Brown, a
Duke University law professor and former global co-head of
listed derivatives at Morgan Stanley. 
JPMorgan has the vast majority of swaps trades in its bank,
though the percentage may be inflated due to the double counting
of a small amount of transactions in other parts of the its
businesses, according to a person familiar with the company&#8217;s
derivatives operations. 
Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America
and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. 
$615 Trillion 
The swaps-desk provision is the most contentious of a
larger set of rules aimed at reducing risk in the system by
imposing for the first time a regulatory structure for the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. The changes would
also require standardized derivatives trades to be cleared
through a third party and traded on an exchange or so-called
swap-execution facility and would regulate the foreign-exchange
swaps market. 
A committee of lawmakers reconciling the House and Senate
versions of financial-regulatory reform is scheduled to take up
derivatives language tomorrow. Lawmakers said they have left it
for the end of the debate because of its complexity. 
The swaps-desk measure introduced in April by Lincoln, who
is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cleared
several hurdles in the legislative process while being
criticized by the banking industry, the administration of
President Barack Obama, the Federal Reserve and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. Last week, seven U.S. regional lenders,
including U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks Inc., came out against
the measure. 
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who
is leading the House negotiations, said in May that he thought
the Lincoln provision &#8220;goes too far.&#8221; He has changed his
stance recently, telling reporters yesterday that &#8220;the
essence&#8221; of the Lincoln proposal would be in the final
legislation. 
&#8220;Certainly they will be totally insulated from any insured
deposits,&#8221; Frank said. 
Volcker 
Last month Frank raised the idea that one way to achieve
Lincoln&#8217;s goals without unintended consequences could be to
expand the scope of another proposal in the bill -- the so-
called Volcker rule, a ban on proprietary trading by banks. That
notion has failed to gain traction in the talks, because the
majority of the swaps trading by the banks is executed for other
customers and might not be covered by a prohibition on banks&#8217;
trading for their own accounts. 
Negotiations have been continuing on possible exemptions
for banks to the Lincoln proposal for certain types of customer-
driven derivatives products. Frank said yesterday Lincoln has
pushed back against those, including an exemption for desks that
serve as market-makers. 
&#8220;Senator Lincoln wants that to go outside&#8221; the depository
institution, Frank said. &#8220;And I think she&#8217;s going to win that
one.&#8221; 
Lucrative Business 
Selling over-the-counter derivatives is among the most
lucrative businesses for the largest financial companies. U.S.
commercial banks held derivatives with a notional value of
$212.8 trillion in the fourth quarter, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of
America, Goldman and Morgan Stanley hold 97 percent of that
total. 
The calculation of derivatives holdings for the five
largest banks is based on a Bloomberg News analysis of the
financial records of the bank holding companies and their
subsidiaries, as well as records filed with federal banking
regulators and posted publicly by the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council. 
Swaps and other derivatives are financial instruments based
on the value of another security or benchmark. Some instruments,
including contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have
been blamed for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst
recession since the Great Depression. 
Fed Lending 
Lincoln and her supporters argue that separating swaps
trading from commercial banking would protect depositors and
other small customers from potentially risky trading that could
bring down a firm. They also say it would prevent bailouts by
denying swaps traders the assistance that the government gives
to banks, such as access to emergency lending from the Fed or
deposit insurance from the FDIC. 
&#8220;We view this as an essential component of making the
system sound so that we can get back to where banks are lending
to businesses that are growing and creating jobs,&#8221; said Heather
Slavkin, a senior legal and policy adviser at the AFL-CIO.
&#8220;When banks use their resources to gamble in the derivatives
markets, they have less capital to invest in businesses that
will create good jobs for working people and grow the middle
class.&#8221; 
Substantial Cost 
Analysts from Citigroup last week wrote that longtime
commercial banks would bear the brunt of the rule, noting that
they would have to give up the benefit of funding their
derivatives deals with funds from deposits. The June 16 report
concluded that while it is &#8220;very difficult&#8221; to determine how
much it would cost to capitalize a free-standing swaps desk, the
price tag is likely to be &#8220;substantial.&#8221; 
&#8220;It all comes down to the cost of funding and it&#8217;s always
easier inside the bank where the credit rating is going to be
higher, the source of funding is more stable and it&#8217;s cheaper,&#8221;
said Brian Gardner, an analyst at investment firm Keefe Bruyette
 Woods. &#8220;Can you do it in a broker-dealer? Yep. People have
done it before and if they have to, they&#8217;ll do it again.&#8221; 
Short-Term Disadvantage 
While the swaps-desk rule, if adopted, would put JPMorgan
and Citigroup at a short-term disadvantage with their
competitors, the big dealers have been arguing on Capitol Hill
that the bigger concern is that U.S. banks will be put at a
competitive disadvantage with foreign counterparts. Large
dealers such as Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays
Plc, would be even less affected by the requirement, analysts
said. 
Neither the European Union nor Asian countries are looking
at requiring banks to wall off their derivatives trading as part
of their responses to the credit crisis. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m getting a lot of calls, hearing from a lot from folks
who do this for a living and they really think this is going to
drive the business away from U.S. banks,&#8221; Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said in an interview.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, agreed to pay $102 million to settle claims
by Massachusetts that the firm financed and securitized unfair
residential loans, state Attorney General Martha Coakley said. 
Of the $102 million, $58 million will be earmarked for more
than 1,000 Massachusetts homeowners, with other funds set aside
for the Massachusetts Pension Fund for investment losses and the
commonwealth&#8217;s general fund, Coakley said today at a press
conference in Boston. 
&#8220;This has become an all-too-familiar pattern in which the
deceptive practices of Wall Street devastated homeowners and
investors, and ultimately contributed to the collapse of our
economy,&#8221; Coakley said. &#8220;Our extensive investigation revealed
that Morgan Stanley not only backed loans for homeowners that
they should have known were destined to fail, they also caused
additional damage in the subprime marketplace.&#8221; 
The bank is barred from making unfair loans and will be
required to make additional disclosures going forward, Coakley
said. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is pleased to resolve this matter in a way
that will help many Massachusetts homeowners stay in their
homes,&#8221; Jennifer Sala, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, said in an e-mailed statement. 
New Century 
Coakley claimed Morgan Stanley provided billions of dollars
to subprime lender New Century, which used those funds to target
low-income borrowers and lure them into loans that consumers
predictably couldn&#8217;t afford to pay. The loans often were
unsustainable, though they were profitable for the lenders, she
said. 
The settlement fund for Massachusetts homeowners will be
overseen by an independent trustee, according to settlement
papers filed in Massachusetts state court. 
The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. The Massachusetts attorney general reached a $60 million
settlement last year with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Morgan Stanley fell 77 cents, or 3 percent, to $24.26 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, sued a former
technology services manager to keep her from working at Oracle
Corp., saying the new position violates a non-compete clause. 
Joanne Olsen, a 31-year veteran of IBM, left the company
this month to become a senior vice president at Oracle,
according to the suit, filed June 16. As a general manager in
IBM&#8217;s technology services division, Olsen knew about IBM&#8217;s
growth strategies and potential acquisitions, the company said. 
&#8220;As a long time general manager in our services business
and as a member of the company&#8217;s leadership team, Joanne Olsen
possesses valuable confidential information about IBM and our
operations,&#8221; IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said today in an e-
mailed statement. 
IBM trails only Oracle and Microsoft Corp. in software
sales. Oracle bought Sun Microsystems Inc. in January for $7.4
billion to enter the server-computer market, where they&#8217;ll also
compete with IBM. 
Olsen signed a non-compete clause in July 2009, stating she
can&#8217;t join a competitor for a year after leaving, according to
the suit. At Oracle, she would become senior vice president of
on-demand services, managing the delivery of its applications
and reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison,
it said. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $1.92, or 1.48
percent, to $128.19 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
today. The shares were little changed this year before today. 
The suit comes one year after IBM tried to keep David Johnson, its former head of mergers and acquisitions, from
joining Dell Inc., another server-computer rival. A judge
dismissed the case, saying Johnson didn&#8217;t have knowledge that
would qualify as &#8220;quintessential trade-secret information.&#8221; 
Olsen&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Delikat, of Orrick Herrington 
Sutcliffe, couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. Oracle spokeswoman
Deborah Hellinger also didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment.

"The Odds Are Increasing That Microsoft's Business Will Collapse"

That's a pretty good title if you (like Henry Blodget from Silicon Alley Insider, the writer of the article) are trying to grab eyeballs. It also provides a useful introduction to what I call the "Innovator's Paradox."

Blodget's article was provocative. He argued that Microsoft is in a no-win situation. It isn't sitting on any idea that is on the cusp of turning into a multi-billion dollar business. The personal computer is losing its dominance to mobile devices and tablets. The company's core profit drivers (Windows and Office) are under disruptive assault from Google's freely available applications and operating system. At best, Microsoft will respond with its own free products and erode its profit margin.

The most telling thing in Blodget's post was a chart that showed the sources of Microsoft's profits over the past few years. Microsoft's core business has continued &#8212; despite continued proclamations of the company's coming demise &#8212; to throw off cash and to grow. But new growth businesses that were specks in 2006 (entertainment and devices and online services) remain tiny, and Microsoft hasn't created any material new businesses over the past few years.

So the real problem isn't what Microsoft is doing today. It's what Microsoft did, or didn't do, five, or even 10 years ago. At the time, its base business was a bastion of strength. Today's threats were in their infancies. It would have been the perfect time to plant seeds that today would be blooming profit generators. 

Why didn't it? It's The Innovator's Paradox: When you don't need the growth, you act in ways that lead to you not getting the growth you will need. And when you do need the growth, you can't act in ways that deliver it.

Got that?

I use this chart to illustrate this point. It's helpful to stimulate discussion among a company's leadership team.

As the chart shows, when times are going great ("exploitation"), companies have ample resources to invest in growth. But because times are going great, innovation efforts tend to be undisciplined. New growth efforts get flooded with cash. Companies don't worry about iterating to find a successful business model. Overpriced acquisitions occur.
Then, inevitably, maturation sets in. The need for new growth intensifies. But resources are harder to come by. Acquisition targets would rather join forces with the new kid on the block whose rapidly appreciating stock acts as a powerful acquisition currency. The acute need for growth gives an almost gravitational pull to large, existing markets. After all, that's where the money is. But large, existing markets are an innovator's fool's gold; glimmery, shiny, but not of much value.

So what do you do about the Innovator's Paradox? Consider what my colleague Clark Gilbert found in his doctoral research. He looked at how newspaper companies responded to the Internet, intersecting the disruptive innovation research of Clayton Christensen and the famous behavioral research of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

Some companies in Gilbert's study viewed the Internet as a threat. That led to them committing resources to innovation efforts. However, they responded in very rigid ways (typically creating replicas of the newspapers online). Other companies viewed the Internet as an opportunity. That framing allowed for more expansive response strategies, but made it difficult to support serious resource allocation. Gilbert summarized this challenge by saying, "Absent a sense of threat, response to disruptive opportunities is inadequate; but with threat, the fully funded response is too rigid."

The trick, Gilbert argued, was to decouple the allocation of resources from the use of the resources. Breaking the Innovator's Paradox requires similar logic. Companies have to recognize that their core business, no matter how great it seems today, has a limit. That recognition should drive consistent allocation of resources to new growth efforts, especially when times are good. But those resources can't be burdened with a "bunker" mentality, or else they will struggle. As one friend told me, "No great growth business was built from a defensive crouch." Further, companies have to make sure they avoid the "curse of abundance" that can lead overly resourced growth efforts to struggle.

So, all you have to do is invest when you don't need to, break psychological barriers that might unintentionally inhibit creativity, and somehow avoid the abundant resources that would seem to be your primary source of competitive advantage. 

No one said this was going to be easy.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley led bank stocks lower, and bearish option trades jumped,
on concern that financial-reform legislation due to be completed
as soon as today may reduce Wall Street revenue. 
The SP 500 Financials Index, which includes 79 financial
firms, dropped as much as 2.2 percent as JPMorgan and Wells
Fargo  Co. fell as much as 3.8 percent. Morgan Stanley dropped
as low as $24.22, its lowest intraday level since May 2009.
Trading of puts to sell the Financial Select Sector SPDR
exchange-traded fund was 2.6 times the four-week average. 
Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are
negotiating the final language of legislation that may limit
banks&#8217; trading in over-the-counter derivatives as well as how
they invest their own capital. Some analysts say the proposed
laws have become tougher in recent weeks. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s starting to really cross over, quite clearly, not
into the area of financial regulatory reform but into punishment
of Wall Street,&#8221; Brian Gardner, a former congressional staffer
who is now a Washington analyst for Keefe, Bruyette  Woods
Inc., said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television.
&#8220;It&#8217;s become a net negative.&#8221; 
The House and Senate conferees are debating a ban on
proprietary trading, nicknamed the Volcker rule after former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as well as a provision
championed by Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln that would
require commercial banks to push out their swaps-trading
operations. 
Analysts Cut Estimates 
The legislation comes as analysts reduce their forecasts
for bank and securities firm earnings in the second quarter
because of a reduction in investment banking and deterioration
in markets in May and June. Barclays Capital analysts slashed
their estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s second-quarter
earnings per share 63 percent yesterday to $1.95 from an earlier
forecast of $5.35. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s so much uncertainty around it and that&#8217;s why
people are scared,&#8221; said Kevin Nichols, vice president for ETF
strategy at Newedge Group in New York. &#8220;It also has to do with
regulators coming in to an industry that&#8217;s facing a lot of other
headwinds like slower investment banking business, analysts
cutting projections and lower volumes in equities.&#8221; 
The SP 500 Financials Index was down 1.95 percent as of
11:42 a.m. and JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
dropped $1.16, or 2.98 percent, to $37.73. 
Almost 485,000 puts to sell the financial ETF changed
hands, 18 times the number of calls giving the right to buy. The
ETF tracking 79 companies fell 1.7 percent to $14.27 as all but
two members retreated. 
The most active contracts were August $13 puts, which rose
37 percent to 37 cents and accounted for almost a third of all
options trading. The ETF hasn&#8217;t closed below $13 since July.

Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the two largest U.S. banks, drove a measure of
financial stocks to the biggest daily gain in a month after
Congress agreed to ease proposed curbs on trading and investing. 
Bank of America and JPMorgan each rose more than 3 percent,
in line with a 3.1 percent advance in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
Diversified Financials Index, as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell. It was the financial index&#8217;s largest one-day
increase since May 27. 
&#8220;The market is sort of celebrating the fact that the
largest banks&#8217; operations are largely left intact,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, founder of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey, who
covers JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  Co. Even so,
future expansion of the biggest banks may be limited, she said. 
The so-called Volcker rule to ban banks from investing in
hedge funds and private equity was &#8220;watered down a bit,&#8221;
allowing lenders to invest as much as 3 percent of their
capital, Deutsche Bank analysts Matt O&#8217;Connor and Michael Carrier said in a note to clients. 
A ban on derivative-trading by commercial banks proposed by
Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas was amended to allow trades
on interest rates and foreign-exchange swaps, which made up
about 92 percent of their total notional trading volume in the
first quarter. Banks will have as many as two years to comply. 
&#8220;What Senator Lincoln wanted to do didn&#8217;t come to pass and
that&#8217;s a major win for the big banks,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets. 
20-Hour Session 
Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, rose
2.7 percent to $15.42. JPMorgan, based in New York, advanced 3.7
percent to $39.44. 
Lawmakers from the House and Senate worked through the
night in a 20-hour session to reach deals on a ban on
proprietary trading by banks and oversight of the derivatives
market. The legislation, which also seeks to protect consumers
from abusive lending practices, still needs to be approved by
the full House and Senate. Congressional leaders aim to hold
votes next week and send it for Obama&#8217;s signature by July 4. 
Obama today praised lawmakers for agreeing on what he
called the &#8220;toughest&#8221; consumer reforms in history. 
The bill is &#8220;not as bad as it looks,&#8221; FBR Capital Markets
analyst Paul Miller wrote in a report. &#8220;The conference
committee avoided adopting the worst-case scenario.&#8221; 
For example, congressional negotiators removed language
that would have required banks to act as a fiduciary when
selling derivatives to states, municipalities and pension funds,
Miller said. Instead, a code of conduct was adopted.

Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s first candidate
treatment for diabetes improved blood sugar control and helped
patients lose weight, a study showed. 
The 12-week study of patients who were also taking the
generic drug metformin found the lowest dose of JJ&#8217;s
canagliflozin reduced blood sugar 0.8 percent, and the highest
dose lowered blood sugar 0.9 percent. Patients in the trial who
were given Merck  Co.&#8217;s Januvia instead had reductions of 0.7
percent. The JJ-funded study didn&#8217;t have enough patients to
compare which treatment was better, the company said in a
statement. 
JJ, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, is testing
canagliflozin as its first drug for diabetes that will compete
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s dapagliflozin, which also had
data reported today. JJ&#8217;s Lifescan unit makes blood glucose
meters, allowing diabetic patients to see if their blood sugar
is too high, and had revenue of $2.4 billion last year. The
company has started enrolling patients for its final-stage
studies of the drug for diabetes. 
&#8220;It helps that people understand they&#8217;ve already committed
to the space,&#8221; said Michael G. King, an analyst for Wedbush
Morgan Securities, in a June 25 interview &#8220;The question is,
&#8216;Why doesn&#8217;t JJ have an insulin and a GPL-1?&#8221; said King,
referring to another category of drugs that includes Byetta from
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co. and Victoza from Denmark-
based Novo Nordisk A/S. 
Diabetes Meeting 
Results were presented today at the American Diabetes
Association&#8217;s annual meeting in Orlando, Florida. 
Canagliflozin works by letting the body excrete more
glucose through the urine. The kidneys have a kind of built-in
thermostat; any rise above a certain amount of blood sugar
triggers a response that sends the excess into the urine.
Canagliflozin lowers the temperature on the thermostat, so more
sugar goes into the urine, while allowing enough blood sugar to
continue circulating to avoid hypoglycemia, said Kirk Ways, the
head of canagliflozin development at the company. 
Patients taking canagliflozin decreased their weight by 2.3
to 3.4 percent. Patients taking placebo and metformin had 1.1
percent weight loss, and those on Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based Merck&#8217;s Januvia dropped 0.6 percent. 
New York-based Bristol-Myers and London-based AstraZeneca
Plc make another experimental drug, dapagliflozin, which works
the same way. Results from a phase 3 trial also announced today
showed that dapagliflozin, in combination with insulin, worked
better than insulin plus a placebo. 
Blood Sugar Levels 
The 800-person study showed reductions of 0.75 percent in
blood sugar for the lowest dose and 0.90 percent for the highest
dose of the Bristol-Myers drug. Patients who got a placebo and
insulin had declines of 0.3 percent. 
Additionally, patients who took dapagliflozin and insulin
lost weight while patients only on insulin gained weight. Taking
dapagliflozin allowed patients to lower their insulin dose. 
If dapagliflozin launches first, it will probably get more
of the market share, said Les Funtleyder, an analyst for Miller
Tabak  Co. 
&#8220;Johnson  Johnson has a lot going in its favor, but they
have to get through Bristol,&#8221; Funtleyder said in a June 23
telephone interview. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s room for two.&#8221; 
Today&#8217;s data are part of a push by JJ into diabetes
treatment. On June 22, the company entered into an agreement
worth as much as $330 million with privately held Metabolex
Inc., based in Hayward, California, to develop diabetes drugs.
The same day, Diamyd Medical AB announced it would partner with
JJ on a drug for Type 1 diabetes, worth as much as $625 million
for the Stockholm, Sweden-based company. The drug is in the
final stage of development. 
&#8220;Johnson  Johnson would like a more holistic approach,
through nutritionals, devices, surgical techniques, and having a
drug that would treat Type 2 diabetes, and offers added benefits
over other drugs,&#8221; said JJ&#8217;s Ways. 
Canagliflozin has &#8220;potential to be a blockbuster,&#8221;
Funtleyder said.

The Bank of Canada named Goldman
Sachs Canada Chief Executive Officer Timothy Hodgson as a
special adviser to Governor Mark Carney, who also worked at the
investment bank. 
Hodgson will work on developing rules for trading repos and
over-the-counter derivatives, and regulations to ensure banks
have enough capital, the Ottawa-based central bank said in a
statement today. A repo is a short-term contract to sell and
repurchase a security, and derivatives are securities whose
value depends on the value of another asset, such as crude oil. 
&#8220;The bank is privileged that someone of his experience has
chosen public service at this critical time,&#8221; Carney said in a
statement. Carney and Hodgson worked together at Goldman Sachs
in New York from 1998-2000, Bank of Canada spokesman Jeremy Harrison said. 
Canada and other Group of 20 nations are crafting rules to
have derivatives traded more through clearinghouses with
standardized contracts, Carney said in a June 10 speech in
Montreal. The global credit crisis was caused in part by
questions about the solvency of banks that led to the breakdown
of trading in important financial markets, he said in Montreal. 
Carney earlier today was named to lead a group at the Bank
for International Settlements that monitors global financial
markets. 
Ivey Graduate 
Hodgson will work for an 18-month term in Toronto starting
Sept. 1. He will serve on bank committees that review
developments affecting monetary policy and the health of the
financial system. 
Hodgson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and has a Master of
Business Administration degree from the Ivey School of Business
at the University of Western Ontario. He has served as the head
of Goldman&#8217;s Canadian unit since 2005, and joined the firm in
1990. 
Jack Curtin will replace Hodgson at Goldman Sachs on July
1, the New York-based company said today in a staff memo. Curtin
was chief executive of the bank&#8217;s Canadian unit from 1995 to
2000, and became chairman in 2002. He joined the firm in 1976
and is based in Toronto.

General Motors Co., preparing for an
initial public offering as soon as the fourth quarter, said U.S.
consumers are paying more per vehicle than last year. 
Customers in the U.S. are paying $3,000 more on average for
GM&#8217;s cars and trucks, Mark Reuss, president of GM North America,
said today in a conference call as part of a daylong
presentation to analysts and potential investors. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre and other
top executives gave a review of Detroit-based GM&#8217;s current
business operations, including restructuring in Europe, growth
in other markets and 85 percent capacity utilization in North
America. The U.S., which holds 61 percent of the automaker, may
sell 20 percent of its stake in the IPO, making it a minority
owner, said two people familiar with the plan. 
&#8220;We are not re-introducing GM,&#8221; Whitacre told the
audience at the automaker&#8217;s technical center in Warren,
Michigan. &#8220;We are introducing a new GM.&#8221; 
Chevrolet has 94 percent of the Uzbekistan market, said Tim Lee, GM&#8217;s president of international operations. The automaker
also plans to grow &#8220;significantly&#8221; in South Korea, he said. 
GM is now positioned to break even during troughs in
demand, Whitacre said. The management team is executing well, he
said. 
Equity Value 
The automaker&#8217;s equity is worth $70 billion, according to a
May 20 report by Eric Selle, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. debt analyst
who projects a return of 47 cents on the dollar for holders of
bonds issued by GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors Corp., that
will be converted to stock and warrants in new GM. At today&#8217;s
bond prices, GM&#8217;s equity is worth about $47 billion. 
GM, the maker of the GMC Terrain, Cadillac SRX and
Chevrolet Camaro, reported first-quarter net income of $865
million, helped by higher production and smaller discounts.
Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell on May 17 called the
profit a &#8220;good, useful step&#8221; toward an IPO. 
The company&#8217;s first-quarter operating profit was $1.2
billion in the first three months of the year, and the company
generated $1 billion in free cash flow, GM said. Revenue rose 40
percent from the same period a year earlier to $31.5 billion. 
GM&#8217;s Opel and Vauxhall operations in Europe lost $506
million in the first quarter. GM is restructuring the business
with plans to take out 20 percent of its production capacity and
cut 8,300 jobs. 
Changing Culture 
GM is changing its culture by cutting the bureaucracy that
made the company so slow, said Vice Chairman Steve Girsky. His
industry-analysis group used to prepare 94 reports a month, he
said, and now it does three. 
The company also has been moving executives to other
operations within the company to bring different perspectives,
he said. 
&#8220;That allows people to ask the basic stupid question that
hasn&#8217;t been asked for 30 years,&#8221; Girsky said. 
Board members thought that managers had too many direct
reports, with some exceeding 20, Girsky said. 
&#8220;Someone with 15 is pretty hard to find&#8221; now, he said. 
GM has the opportunity to increase annual sales by about
2.6 million vehicles by 2014 if GM holds its market share in key
regions, Liddell said. He cited a forecast from Lexington,
Massachusetts-based research firm IHS Automotive that calls for
annual global auto sales to grow by 25 million vehicles by 2014. 
GM has a &#8220;massive global opportunity if we are successful
maintaining market share,&#8221; Liddell said. 
Reducing Debt 
The automaker also needs to reduce its debt, Liddell said.
Debt, preferred shares held by the U.S. Treasury and underfunded
pension plans total $42.2 billion while GM has $30 billion in
cash, he showed in a slide presentation. 
GM&#8217;s pension plans are underfunded by $26.8 billion, GM
said. It doesn&#8217;t have to put any cash in now, Liddell said. 
The company will probably have to put cash into the pension
fund, while investments could take care of some of the
shortfall, Liddell said. 
&#8220;The pension plan is a huge continuing liability,&#8221;
Liddell said. &#8220;Almost certainly we will have to put cash in at
some stage. Once fully funded, we&#8217;ll change the investment
strategy to lock in.&#8221; 
GM will most likely rely on outside lenders to finance the
sale of cars to consumers and dealers, Liddell said. Banks and
other financial institutions have better access to cheap funds
than GM, which doesn&#8217;t have investment-grade credit, he said. 
Rather than saddle GM&#8217;s balance sheet with banking assets,
the company will find lenders to handle different types of
loans. GM has AmeriCredit Corp. handling subprime lending and
U.S. Bank for leasing and Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC
LLC, handling the bulk of dealer financing and car loans to
consumers.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been
more responsive to information requests from the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission since being subpoenaed and has made
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein available for an
interview, the panel&#8217;s leaders said. 
Blankfein was interviewed recently by FCIC staff &#8220;at
length,&#8221; commission Chairman Phil Angelides said today in a
conference call with journalists. Angelides said on June 7 that
the panel had subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the commission with documents. 
&#8220;I have no question&#8221; that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas
said today on the call. &#8220;It was the lack of specificity, or
even the acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles
of documents we got, that was cleared up.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar will testify at a two-day FCIC hearing beginning
tomorrow reviewing the role of derivatives in the recession.
Also scheduled to testify is Joseph Cassano, the former American
International Group Inc. executive whose bets on subprime
mortgages led the insurer to the brink of collapse in 2008,
requiring a U.S. bailout. 
&#8220;This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you&#8217;d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset,&#8221; Thomas said. 
$12.9 Billion 
After AIG&#8217;s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. 
AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including Goldman
Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG protecting them
against declines in the value of mortgages. When the housing
market collapsed, AIG didn&#8217;t have enough funds to honor its
contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that swelled to
$182.3 billion. Cassano was interviewed for about five hours. 
Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren&#8217;t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. 
Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. 
Credit-Default Swaps 
The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. 
Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

Walt Disney Co. opened its first
redesigned store in Montebello, California, today as part of a
six-year plan to make its 350 retail outlets worldwide more
entertaining for shoppers. 
The media company will open revamped locations 20 in the
U.S. and Europe by November, the start of the holiday shopping
season, Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said
in an interview. 
Disney has consolidated its retail business after taking
back control over U.S. and Japan operations. The new stores will
let customers build characters from Disney&#8217;s Pixar Studio movie
&#8220;Cars,&#8221; interact with a magic mirror and watch clips from film
and TV shows in a movie theater with a 12-foot (3.6-meter)
screen. 
&#8220;Today in retail you have to be a special destination or
very, very price conscious,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going for
special.&#8221; 
Disney will next open revamped stores in Madrid, then in
Portugal and Italy, before an outlet at Roosevelt Field mall in
Garden City, New York, at the end of July, Fielding said. A
store in Santa Monica, California, is slated for Aug. 8. 
The Montebello store features 13-foot plastic trees on
which Disney videos are projected. The goal is to keep shoppers
entertained in the store for 30 minutes, Fielding said. 
Disney, which owns movie studios, theme parks and the ABC
and ESPN television networks, got about 6.7 percent of its $36
billion in revenue last fiscal year from the consumer-products
unit, which includes retail stores, according to Bloomberg data. 
Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 92 cents to
$32.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares are little changed this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Richard Berliand, who helped combine Bear Stearns Cos.&#8217;s prime brokerage
unit into the firm, is retiring after 23 years at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets. 
Berliand will be replaced by Sandie O&#8217;Connor, JPMorgan&#8217;s
global head of financing and market products, who has also spent
more than two decades at the company, according to a memo sent
to employees today from Carlos Hernandez, JPMorgan&#8217;s global head
of equities. 
&#8220;Richard&#8217;s deep understanding of our markets businesses
and the regulatory environment has enhanced our ability to stay
ahead of the changes occurring in our industry,&#8221; Hernandez
wrote. The memo was confirmed by spokesman Brian Marchiony.
Financial News reported the move earlier today. 
Berliand ran several global divisions during his career at
New York-based JPMorgan, overseeing cash equities, futures and
options. As the global head of prime services, he oversaw the
bank&#8217;s prime brokerage, futures and options as well as
derivatives-clearing operations. Berliand, who wants to spend
more time with his family, will stay for a month while O&#8217;Connor
transitions to her new role, Hernandez said. 
O&#8217;Connor will work with the global equities group to expand
JPMorgan&#8217;s prime services business in Europe, the Middle East
and Asia, Hernandez said. She will also continue her role
overseeing JPMorgan&#8217;s prime custody solutions group, which acts
as a custodian for hedge funds and other large institutional
investors. 
She previously oversaw global securities lending, clearing,
collateral management, foreign exchange, depository receipts and
execution services. 
Jeremy Barnum, 38, a managing director in the bank&#8217;s global
fixed-income group, will take over Berliand&#8217;s duties chairing
the firm&#8217;s market-structure group, which evaluates regulatory
and market changes. Barnum will also continue in his current
role reporting to Daniel Pinto, the co-head of fixed-income
products, Hernandez said.

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc may consider bidding for BP Plc after the London-based
oil company lost more than half of its market value in the wake
of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. said. 
Exxon Mobil has the stronger balance sheet and proven
ability to integrate a large transaction, according to Fred Lucas, a London-based analyst at JP Morgan. It could make a cash
and share offer, valuing BP at 473 pence a share compared with
yesterday&#8217;s close of 308.25 pence, and including a $50 billion
spin-off of BP&#8217;s downstream assets, according to JPMorgan. 
BP&#8217;s market value has collapsed by more than $100 billion
since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 crew members and caused the leak.
The company has set aside $20 billion to pay for Gulf
restoration and compensation claims and said yesterday the cost
of battling the spill had reached $2.65 billion. 
Any potential attempt to buy BP would have to be backed by
&#8220;ruthless integration,&#8221; JPMorgan said. BP has many high
quality assets, including deepwater positions and upstream
operations, Lucas wrote under a future possible scenario. 
Sheila Williams, a spokeswoman for BP, declined to comment,
as did Kim Blomley, a London-based spokesman for Shell.

Microsoft Corp. scrapped the new Kin
social-networking smartphone because sales fell well short of
the company&#8217;s expectations, a person with knowledge of the
decision said. 
The phone&#8217;s high price contributed to lackluster demand,
said the person, who declined to be named because the
discussions were private. Microsoft announced plans to end work
on the Kin earlier today, saying it would focus on Windows Phone
software. The device debuted less than two months ago. 
Kin, sold through Verizon Wireless, marked Microsoft&#8217;s
first major foray into the hardware design of a mobile phone. It
was part of a dual strategy of developing its own phone while
working on new Windows software for other companies&#8217; handsets.
Verizon&#8217;s price cuts of the Kin on June 28 may have come too
late to save the phone. 
&#8220;Sales weren&#8217;t going that well at Verizon, so better to
kill it than have it fester on,&#8221; said Ken Dulaney, a Gartner
Inc. analyst in Redwood City, California. &#8220;Verizon did a very
poor job advertising this thing. The price of the data plan was
a killer.&#8221; 
Verizon required an unlimited data plan for $29.99, plus a
voice plan. The phones were released May 6 online and went on
sale in stores May 13. Those models will remain available. 
&#8220;We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell
current Kin phones,&#8221; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said
in a statement. 
Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New Jersey-
based Verizon Wireless, said the Kin &#8220;is still an important
part of our portfolio.&#8221; 
Lower Price 
Verizon cut the price of the Kin One to $29.99 from $49.99,
with a $100 discount and a two-year contract. The price of the
Kin Two, which has a larger screen and takes sharper photos, was
reduced to $49.99 from $99.99. 
The Microsoft team working on the product has been folded
into the Windows Phone unit, the company said today. A planned
release of the devices in Europe has been canceled. 
Microsoft will now focus its attention on its mobile
operating system, which has been losing market share to software
from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Mobile-phone makers will begin
offering devices with Windows Phone 7, a complete overhaul of
the software, later this year. It&#8217;s critical that those phones
fare better than the Kin, Dulaney said. 
&#8220;The big bet is on Windows Phone 7 -- if they don&#8217;t get
that right, they&#8217;re in big trouble,&#8221; he said. The Kin &#8220;was a
sidecar effort.&#8221; 
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system accounted for 6.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone-software market in the first
quarter, down from 10.8 percent a year earlier, according to
Michael Morgan, an analyst at ABI Research. Shipments of the
iPhone rose to 15.8 percent, while Android-based phones took 9.9
percent. 
Microsoft&#8217;s decision was reported earlier by Gizmodo.

After AIG&#8217;s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including
Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG
protecting them against declines in the value of mortgages. When
the housing market collapsed, AIG didn&#8217;t have enough funds to
honor its contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion. 
Joseph Cassano 
Cassano, who oversaw an AIG unit managing $2 trillion in
derivative trades, was interviewed for about five hours by FCIC
staff. He had previously shied away from public statements while
regulators investigated his role in the swaps trades, which he
said in 2007 would be profitable. 
&#8220;He was a person with extraordinary knowledge of the inner
workings of that company and the relationships with others,&#8221;
Angelides said. 
The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said on May 26 that a
review of the business Cassano oversaw didn&#8217;t turn up any
criminal violations. U.S. prosecutors also won&#8217;t bring charges,
a person familiar with the investigation said last month. 
Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren&#8217;t told that the hedge fund led by John Paulson
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded. 
Bear Stearns 
Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs. 
The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than 8 million U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President Barack Obama by
December. 
Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

Walt Disney Co. acquired Tapulous
Inc., a developer of music-related video games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s
iPhone and iPad, to expand its mobile business. 
Disney anticipates growth on Apple&#8217;s platforms and mobile
devices, Steve Wadsworth, head of the company&#8217;s Internet unit,
said today in an interview. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
With the deal, Burbank, California-based Disney becomes one
of the biggest developers of games for Apple&#8217;s App Store.
Tapulous has 30 million users and is profitable, according to
its website. &#8220;Tap Tap Revenge,&#8221; a top-selling download at the
App Store, is played by tapping a screen to the rhythm of a
song. While the software is free, players must buy new songs. 
&#8220;This is an extremely high-growth industry, both mobile
games and mobile media,&#8221; Wadsworth said. &#8220;We are there and we
want to continue to be there in a very big way.&#8221; 
Tapulous founder and Chief Executive Officer Bart Decrem,
operating chief Andrew Lacy and the development team are joining
Disney&#8217;s mobile-games group, Wadsworth said. 
&#8220;Their ability to effectively monetize, in a very
efficient way, games on these devices is very attractive,&#8221;
Wadsworth said. &#8220;Their insight into how that works will be very
helpful as we grow on these platforms.&#8221; 
Disney Characters 
Decrem said in an interview he will be head of Disney&#8217;s
mobile division, which will create new titles based on Disney
characters and intellectual property, as well as continue to
distribute the &#8220;Tap Tap Revenge&#8221; games. 
The deal came together over the past three to four months,
Decrem said. Tapulous was considering whether to raise another
round of funding from investors when it decided to join Disney
instead. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge opportunity,&#8221; he said. 
The acquisition was reported earlier by industry website
TechCrunch.com. 
Tapulous investors include Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff and Sun Microsystems Inc. co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim,
according to the company&#8217;s website. Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s chief
executive officer, is Disney&#8217;s biggest shareholder and a
director. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 1 cent to
$31.49 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have declined 2.4 percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. refused a
request from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to reveal
how much it makes trading derivatives, saying the bank doesn&#8217;t
separate the figure from other businesses. 
&#8220;Some other firms have provided us with that data when
we&#8217;ve asked for it and Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Commissioner
Brooksley Born said today in Washington on the second day of a
hearing investigating the role of derivatives in the 2008 credit
crisis, which sparked the worst recession since the 1930s. &#8220;It
makes one wonder why Goldman has the incentive or impetus to not
release this information.&#8221; 
Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
derivatives dealer, have provided estimates to investors. The
top five U.S. commercial banks, including Goldman Sachs,
generated an estimated $28 billion in revenue from privately
negotiated derivatives in 2009, according to company reports
collected by the Federal Reserve and people familiar with banks&#8217;
income sources. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in
history, is being questioned about credit-default swap trades
with American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out
by the U.S. government after AIG was unable to meet collateral
demands from trading partners on the contracts. The swaps, used
by Goldman Sachs and other banks to hedge against declines in
the value of mortgage-linked debt, caused losses at AIG as
housing prices collapsed. 
&#8216;It&#8217;s Integrated&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
testified today that the firm has no way of separating out its
derivatives data from trading in cash securities. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a separate derivatives business,&#8221; Viniar
told the panel. &#8220;It&#8217;s integrated into the rest of our
business.&#8221; 
Commissioner Byron Georgiou said he doubted Goldman Sachs
was unable to provide the information. 
&#8220;When you tell us that you don&#8217;t know how much you make in
your derivatives business, nobody here really believes it,&#8221;
Georgiou told Viniar. &#8220;Nobody here believes that you don&#8217;t know
how much money you&#8217;re making on the various aspects of your
business, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; 
$49.1 Trillion 
Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to an Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency report last month. The bank
reported total trading revenue of $7.65 billion during the first
quarter. That follows total trading revenue of $23.2 billion in
2009, according to a filing with the Federal Reserve. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of dangerous, don&#8217;t you think, to claim to the
FCIC that you don&#8217;t know the profitability of a major line of
business,&#8221; said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the
University of Houston. &#8220;How can you rationally allocate
capital, for instance, if you don&#8217;t know the return to that
capital?&#8221; 
Under a March 2008 amendment to derivatives accounting
standards, companies are exempt from breaking out gains or
losses on derivatives used as part of a trading book that also
includes cash securities, if other information on the trading
activities is provided, according to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board&#8217;s Statement No. 161. 
Goldman Sachs is &#8220;definitely capable of providing the data
that was asked for, but I can understand their fear of doing
so,&#8221; said Brian Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at
broker-dealer Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and
a former credit swaps trader. 
Derivatives Revenue 
&#8220;There is a potential for such a number to vastly
overstate the amount of profit or loss captured by a particular
business because much of that business may be symbiotic with
another,&#8221; Yelvington said. &#8220;They may have made money on the
derivatives leg of a trade, for example, and lost it on the cash
leg.&#8221; 
JPMorgan said in February 2009 that about 8 percent of its
total revenue from 2006 to 2008 came from derivatives in its
investment-banking unit, according to a presentation made to
investors. 
That breakdown and revenue figures from regulatory filings
imply that half of JPMorgan&#8217;s $31.2 billion in trading revenue
those years came from derivatives, according to Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in New
York. 
&#8216;Highly Imprecise&#8217; 
&#8220;Reporting a revenue number, just the profit on
derivatives without looking at cash positions associated with
hedging those, is going to be a highly imprecise exercise,&#8221;
Yavorsky said in an interview today. 
Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the commission last month
after the New York-based firm sent more than a billion pages of
documents to the panel, a shipment so sizable that panel members
called it an attempt to hinder their probe. 
&#8220;We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our
offices and dump a bunch of rubbish,&#8221; Chairman Phil Angelides,
who previously served as California&#8217;s treasurer, said June 7.
&#8220;This has been a very deliberate effort over time to run out
the clock.&#8221; 
The commission, which will report its findings to Congress
and President Barack Obama by December, said June 29 that the
bank had been more responsive to information requests since
being subpoenaed. Separately, Goldman Sachs faces a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud suit over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. The bank has said the SEC suit is
unfounded. 
Born&#8217;s Warning 
Born had warned in 1998, as chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, that the unregulated over-the-
counter derivatives market posed a danger to the global
financial system. She moved to address changes in how swaps
based on interest rates, commodities or currencies were traded
and was stopped by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
who all argued the market could regulate itself. 
Born said last year that the banks that caused the crisis
were trying to stop the congressional overhaul of the market. 
&#8220;Special interests in the financial-services industry are
beginning to advocate a return to business as usual,&#8221; Born said
in May 2009 as she accepted a Profile in Courage award from the
John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.

The price is about $400 million, according to a person

identifies devices that aren&#8217;t in compliance with corporate
policy and recommends fixes in real-time. 
IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he is
planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the next
five years. The software unit, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in 2015, the company
said in May. The unit has made about 60 acquisitions since 2003. 
BigFix, based in Emeryville, California, has about 200
employees and 700 customers, including SunTrust Bank. The deal
is expected to close this quarter. 
IBM fell 91 cents to $122.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock

Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s
largest brokerage, hired 100 bankers to offer more products such
as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney clients and may quintuple their numbers by the end of
2011, a person with knowledge of the strategy said. 
The firm is building a private bank to squeeze more revenue
from clients and encourage them to hold deposits at the company.
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s wealth management group had $191 million of
interest income in the first quarter, a fraction of the $1.1
billion at Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit. Private
bankers offer loans, savings products and sometimes investment
advice to a bank&#8217;s wealthiest clients. 
&#8220;There is always this hidden opportunity of cross-sell,&#8221;
said Steve Stelmach, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;Merrill Lynch has been successful in
offering mortgage products to their retail customers, so the
precedent is there.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley joins Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. in trying to do more business with wealthy customers as the
weak economy and new regulations make it harder to earn money
from loans and investment banking. Bankers have pushed cross-
selling for decades, often with little to show for it, to expand
their business without having to sign up new customers. 
Fed Approves Application 
&#8220;Every major financial firm has decided they are going to
grab a piece of wealth management, whether it&#8217;s private banking
or advisory,&#8221; said Jeanne Branthover, head of the financial-
services practice at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York.
&#8220;The combination of financial advisers working with the private
bankers is becoming more common. Ten years ago, they were
totally separate.&#8221; 
Private bankers are usually paid a salary and a bonus,
while financial advisers&#8217; compensation is based on commissions,
Branthover said. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York today approved Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s application to create Morgan Stanley Private Bank N.A.
It&#8217;s headed by Cece Stewart, 52, whom Morgan Stanley hired in
2008 from Wachovia Corp., where she had risen to executive vice
president from branch manager over three decades. The firm
started hiring the private bankers last year. 
Boosting Loan Balances 
The private bank plans to as much as triple its loan
balances to between $50 billion and $60 billion by the end of
2014, said the person, who declined to be named because the
plans haven&#8217;t been made public. The bank now has about $19
billion in loans largely from its previous lending efforts,
which mostly focused on agency mortgages, the person said. 
The private bank will also offer deposit products to
clients who hold more than $1.6 trillion of assets in the
brokerage. Morgan Stanley considered buying a banking franchise
before deciding to build its own private bank in the first half
of 2009, the person said. That was the same year that Morgan
Stanley formed its brokerage, which has more than 18,000
advisers, when it bought a controlling stake in the joint
venture with Citigroup. Merrill Lynch, by comparison, has about
15,000 financial advisers. 
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, said
today it named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to boost the
share of assets it holds for its wealthiest client to more than
the current 5 percent. Sommers was named CEO of Retail Affluent
and Investment Services, giving him responsibility for the
bank&#8217;s 2,700 financial advisers. 
Citigroup&#8217;s Hires 
The initiative could increase pretax profits by $500
million to $1 billion annually, Charlie Scharf, JPMorgan&#8217;s head
of retail financial services, said in a statement. 
Citigroup has hired about 15 private bankers since March
and will add another 115 over the next several years, spokesman
Mark Costiglio said in an interview last month. 
Bank of America is trying to persuade its 12 million
customers to move funds from rival brokers to Merrill Lynch and
wants Merrill Lynch clients to transfer some of the $500 billion
they have at other banks, according to a May 10 presentation.
Wells Fargo is focused on 3 million customers who keep more than
$250,000 for investments at other companies, according to Senior
Executive Vice President David Carroll. 
It&#8217;s often difficult to gauge how successful efforts to
sell clients new products are because banks rarely provide data
on their cross-selling efforts, said Stelmach, the FBR analyst. 
Jumbo Mortgages 
Morgan Stanley is now offering jumbo mortgages, home-equity
lines and securities lending, said Armando Cabo, a private
banker who joined from JPMorgan this year. The bank plans to
offer some commercial loans to clients later this year, Cabo
said. It&#8217;s offering mortgages of up to $5 million and home-
equity lines up to $2.5 million, spokesman Jim Wiggins said. 
The private bankers will work with financial advisers to
arrange lending options for clients, with the advisers remaining
the primary contact. Cabo said he&#8217;s working with about 80 to 90
advisers. 
The firm has been offering &#8220;aggressive&#8221; interest rates to
win clients, said Shawn Rubin, a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
financial adviser in New York. Lending and managing clients&#8217;
liabilities will probably be the highest-growth revenue source
of his business this year, Rubin said. 
&#8220;The markets have been very challenging for a while, and
clients are sort of used to the markets not doing a whole lot
for their net worth,&#8221; Rubin said. &#8220;So they are really focused
on the other avenues of wealth management, whether that&#8217;s risk
management or liability management.&#8221; 
Home-Loan Rates 
Record low home-loan rates may prompt some clients who had
loans with other banks, including Citigroup&#8217;s private bank, to
refinance, providing a chance for Morgan Stanley to gain market
share, Rubin said. Rates for 30-year fixed loans declined to
4.69 percent in the week ended June 24, mortgage-finance company
Freddie Mac said last week. That&#8217;s below the previous record of
4.71 percent, set in the week ended Dec. 3. 
Jumbo mortgages are larger than the ones that government-
supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can finance, now from
$417,000 to $729,750 in high-cost areas. About 10.3 percent of
U.S. prime jumbo mortgages which backed securities were at least
60 days late in May, according to Fitch Ratings. That&#8217;s up from
10.2 percent in April, marking the 36th straight increase for
&#8220;serious delinquencies.&#8221; 
Compensation Ratio 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s wealth-management unit had revenue of
$3.11 billion in the first quarter, down from $3.14 billion in
the fourth. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who led the
unit before succeeding John Mack in January, said in a letter to
shareholders this year that the joint venture will play &#8220;an
increasingly important role in our growth and profitability.&#8221; 
The effort is likely to lower the wealth-management unit&#8217;s
compensation ratio over time, according to two people briefed on
the matter. The division&#8217;s ratio of compensation costs to
revenue was 64 percent in the first quarter, compared with 41
percent in the institutional securities business, which includes
the trading and investment banking units. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re making huge investments on the lending front,
because Morgan Stanley did not do things like non-conforming
mortgages and structured or tailored loans, and we had that
through Citi&#8217;s private bank,&#8221; Charles Johnston, president of
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said in an interview in April.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge opportunity there, and we&#8217;ve got that now,
we&#8217;ve built that.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, named Barry Sommers to lead an effort to
boost the share of assets it holds for its wealthiest clients to
more than 5 percent. 
Sommers, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Securities,
will become CEO of retail affluent and investment services,
JPMorgan said today in a statement from Business Wire. He&#8217;ll
report to Charlie Scharf, head of retail financial services. 
&#8220;Our initiative will help us serve customers better and
could increase pretax profits by $500 million to $1 billion
annually,&#8221; Scharf said in the statement. 
Banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and
Wells Fargo  Co. are encouraging wealthy customers to do more
business with them as the weak economy and new regulations make
it harder to earn money from loans and investment banking.
Morgan Stanley plans to hire as many as 500 bankers to build its
private bank, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The customers JPMorgan distinguishes as affluent typically
have at least $500,000 in investable assets, spokesman Thomas Kelly said in a telephone interview. JPMorgan Securities was
formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. 
JPMorgan shares, down 15 percent this year compared with a
6.6 percent decrease in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index, fell 3 percent to $35.48 as of 11:27 a.m. in New York

30 years at Cravath, Morgan Stanley said today in a statement.
Lynch, 59, who announced in February that he would step down
from his post, will remain vice chairman and a member of the
firm&#8217;s operating and management committees. 
Eric Grossman, the bank&#8217;s general counsel for the Americas
and global head of litigation, was appointed to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
management committee, the New York-based firm said. Grossman was
a candidate for the chief legal position, a person briefed on
the matter said in February. 
&#8220;The partnership between Frank and Eric will provide
tremendous leadership on the legal and regulatory fronts in this
challenging period for the securities industry,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman said in an internal memo obtained
today by Bloomberg News. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jeanmarie McFadden confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. 
Barron was among Cravath lawyers who advised Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s board on its conversion to a bank holding company and
on Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s $9 billion investment
in the firm as its stock plunged after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy in 2008, according to the law firm&#8217;s website. 
Represented Banks 
Barron also represented National City Corp.&#8217;s board in its
2008 sale to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and CSX Corp.,
the third-largest U.S. railroad, in its defense against activist
hedge funds seeking seats on its board. Barron has also served
banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS
AG, according to the statement. 
Barron, a Boston native, graduated from Harvard University
in 1973 and Harvard Law School in 1978. He joined Cravath that
year, rising to partner in 1985. 
Lynch headed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
enforcement division from 1985 to 1989 and led insider-trading
investigations of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Former Morgan
Stanley CEO John Mack hired Lynch to work at Credit Suisse First
Boston in 2001 and then at Morgan Stanley when Mack moved there
in 2005. Mack stepped down as CEO at the beginning of this year
and remains chairman.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
repeated their position that disputes with American
International Group Inc. over securities prices and collateral
in 2007 and 2008 reflected the firm&#8217;s typical risk-management
efforts. 
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and David Lehman, co-
head of the firm&#8217;s structured products group trading desk, are
scheduled to testify this morning before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission in Washington. Their prepared testimony
replays comments made yesterday by President and Chief Operating
Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick. 
&#8220;We established credit terms with AIG consistent with
those extended to other major counterparts, including collateral
arrangements that we tightly managed,&#8221; Viniar said in prepared
remarks. &#8220;As we do with many other counterparty relationships,
we limited our exposure to AIG through a combination of
collateral and market hedges.&#8221; 
The FCIC, led by Chairman Philip Angelides and Vice
Chairman William Thomas, today holds its second day of a two-day
hearing into the role that derivatives played in the credit
crisis, with a focus on the relationship between Goldman Sachs
and AIG, the insurer that had to be bailed out by the federal
government. Members of the committee repeatedly questioned
yesterday whether Goldman Sachs marked down the value of its
complex trades with AIG to force AIG to pay collateral. AIG
disputed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s marks as too low. 
Clients Complained 
The committee released internal e-mails yesterday that
showed Goldman Sachs employees discussing other clients such as
Tokyo-based AIOI Insurance Co. complaining that Goldman Sachs
was marking mortgage-backed securities at prices that were
&#8220;more than twice as bad as the second worst dealer&#8217;s.&#8221;
Angelides asked Goldman Sachs yesterday to provide information
about how the firm derived the prices it set on its trades with
AIG, and Cohn agreed to do so. 
Goldman Sachs, whose record profits in 2007 were helped in
part by the firm&#8217;s negative bets on subprime mortgage-related
securities, is fighting accusations from regulators, members of
Congress and former clients that the firm designed securities it
knew would fail and bet on their collapse by buying credit-
default swaps, which pay out in the event of a default. Goldman
Sachs has denied any wrongdoing. Cohn said yesterday that the
firm had shorted just 1 percent of the mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations the company
underwrote between December 2006 and June 2007. 
Pricing Sources 
In his testimony today, Lehman will say that the firm&#8217;s
prices were based on two main sources: the marks of comparable
transactions trading in the market and information obtained from
market participants through bid or offer prices for similar
securities or derivatives. 
&#8220;We would collect information generated by these
comparable transactions,&#8221; Lehman says in his testimony. &#8220;Then,
we would perform a variety of analyses on the collected
comparables in order to gain a sense of the market value of the
Goldman/AIG swaps from the pricing reflected in actual market
transactions in similar derivatives.&#8221; 
Viniar and Lehman will testify today alongside former AIG
Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger and other AIG
executives. 
Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC last July to
investigate the causes of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. The panel has until December to report its
findings to Congress.

Investors should bet that longer-term
interest rates will rise faster than short-dated ones as central
banks maintain low interest rates as the recovery takes hold,
according to Morgan Stanley. 
Five-year notes will perform best, making the most
profitable trades to buy them against 10-year and 30-year bonds,
fixed-income strategists led by Jim Caron in New York wrote in a
research report dated yesterday. Five-year rates will fall
relative to two-year ones, they said. 
&#8220;Economic stability is an underpriced risk that we believe
will be the surprise for the market in the second half of the
year as it ignites an asset reflation trade,&#8221; the strategists
said. &#8220;Much of the double dip and deflation fears are already
priced. European sovereigns muddle along and the risk premium
assigned to them declines. This will allow the forces associated
with global growth to reassert themselves, producing higher
yields and steeper curves.&#8221; 
The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year U.S.
Treasuries over five-year notes narrowed one basis point to 115
basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in London. The so-called yield
spread was at 137 basis points on March 9.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. could have
done a better job managing reputational risks as it navigated
the credit crisis and has since reconsidered some decisions,
said President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve done a good job. Could we have done a better job?
Sure.&#8221; Cohn, 49, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;With hindsight, I know a lot more today than I did
back then.&#8221; 
Cohn spoke after testifying before the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, where he answered questions about the firm&#8217;s
derivatives business and particularly its interactions with
American International Group Inc., the insurer that was bailed
out by the U.S. government. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation was
marred in April when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
the firm for fraud over sales of a mortgage-backed security. The
bank has denied wrongdoing. 
&#8220;Based on all our internal data, we are doing fine, we are
doing well with our clients,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We continue to be at
the center of all flows, we continue to be engaged with clients,
we continuously are winning business.&#8221; 
Financial regulatory reform legislation, which passed the
House of Representatives yesterday and still needs Senate
approval, will require New York-based Goldman Sachs to hold more
capital, to be less leveraged, and to abandon &#8220;pure proprietary
trading,&#8221; he said. He didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility that the
firm could give up its bank holding company status sometime in
the future.

General Motors Co. is talking with a
number of banks about setting up a revolving line of credit that
may be worth $5 billion or more, said two people with knowledge
of the plan. 
The automaker could use the credit line to pay business
costs while using its cash to pay off more expensive debt, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plan is private. GM also wants to get a line of credit to
establish relationships between the company and a variety of
banks, the people said. 
The arrangements aren&#8217;t complete and the values may change,
both people said. 
Noreen Pratscher, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based GM,
declined to comment. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on GM seeking a
line of credit. 
GM is also talking with several major banks to arrange more
options for customers&#8217; car loans, one of the people said. GM
uses Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC LLC, for the bulk of its
auto lending. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp handles leasing and
AmeriCredit Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, does subprime lending
for GM&#8217;s customers and dealers. 
GM Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said at an
investor conference June 29 that GM will look at a variety of
lending sources for consumer car loans rather than carrying the
assets and liabilities of an in-house lending business on its
own books.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s first-half sales
in China surpassed those in the U.S. for the first time as the
world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy propelled global auto
demand. 
Sales in China by GM and its joint ventures totaled
1.21 million vehicles in the six months ended June 30, topping
U.S. deliveries of 1.08 million, based on figures reported
separately by the Detroit-based company. This would be the first
time any overseas market has &#8220;consistently outsold&#8221; GM&#8217;s
domestic market in the carmaker&#8217;s 102-year-old history, said
Michael Albano, a Shanghai-based spokesman. 
Surging demand among China&#8217;s 1.37 billion people is
speeding automakers&#8217; recovery after a recession cut global auto
sales last year and forced GM&#8217;s predecessor, General Motors
Corp., into bankruptcy. GM is counting on expansion overseas to
bolster profit as it prepares for an initial public offering as
early as the fourth quarter. 
&#8220;China is one of GM&#8217;s bright spots globally,&#8221; said John Zeng, a Shanghai-based automotive analyst at IHS Global Insight.
&#8220;GM has done a better job in the Chinese market than other
American automakers. The huge potential in this market will
continue to fuel GM&#8217;s growth here.&#8221; 
Government stimulus measures helped China&#8217;s industrywide
vehicle sales jump 46 percent last year to 13.6 million,
surpassing the U.S. for the first time to become the world&#8217;s
largest national automobile market. U.S. auto sales fell
21 percent to 10.4 million, the fewest since 1982, as
unemployment rose amid the worst recession in six decades.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecast for China this year to 10.1 percent from 11.4
percent as government restrictions on lending and real estate
slow expansion in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy. 
Asian stocks fell after the report fanned concern that
slower growth in China will undermine the global recovery. Hours
after Goldman&#8217;s revision, China increased its estimate for last
year&#8217;s growth to 9.1 percent, signaling output almost matched
Japan&#8217;s as the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. 
Goldman joins BNP Paribas, Macquarie Securities Ltd. and
China International Capital Corp. in reducing estimates as the
government tightens property restrictions to prevent overheating.
A third of China economists may cut &#8220;overly bullish&#8221; forecasts
for 2010 and 2011 in coming weeks, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
economist Lu Ting said in a June 30 note to clients. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s growth has been slowing down sharply and the
tightening measures we saw in April on property have been quite
aggressive,&#8221; Isaac Meng, a Beijing-based economist at BNP
Paribas, said in a phone interview today. 
The government won&#8217;t &#8220;launch easing measures in the short
term as the major concerns, especially about the property bubble,
haven&#8217;t been fully addressed,&#8221; Meng said. BNP this week reduced
China&#8217;s 2010 growth forecast to 9.8 percent from 10.5 percent. 
Manufacturing in the nation, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
computers and mobile phones, expanded at the slowest pace in 16
months, a survey of purchasing managers showed yesterday. Stocks
declined around the world this week on evidence that a cooling
China combined with austerity measures in Europe and slower
growth in the U.S. will hurt the global recovery. 
Stocks Fall 
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3 percent to 111.64 as
of 6:06 p.m. in Tokyo, the fourth straight decline. The gauge
has slumped 14 percent from its high this year on April 15. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China&#8217;s
stock exchanges, slid to its lowest level in 14 months this week. 
Liao Qun, a Hong Kong-based economist at Citic Bank
International Ltd, today lowered his forecast for China&#8217;s growth
this year to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent, citing the property
sector, the European crisis and the government&#8217;s 0.4 percentage
point upward revision to 2009 gross domestic product. 
The adjustment put the value of last year&#8217;s GDP at 34.05
trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement on its website. The figure translates to $4.98
trillion based on the average exchange rate between the yuan and
the dollar in 2009, suggesting Japan retained its position as
the second-largest economy with output of $5.07 trillion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
More Sustainable Pace 
Analysts including Sun Mingchun at Nomura Holdings Inc. say
China&#8217;s moderation is a sign that the government is moving the
country to a more sustainable pace of expansion after a 4
trillion yuan stimulus package drove an 11.9 percent rebound in
the first quarter. 
&#8220;The June PMI data confirms that the manufacturing sector
still remains in a solid expansion stage,&#8221; Sun, a Hong Kong-
based economist at Nomura, said in a note yesterday. &#8220;If the
decline does not continue for too long, it should prove a
healthy correction that reduces the risk of the economy
overheating.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s economy is moving in the &#8220;expected direction,&#8221;
Premier Wen Jiabao said in meetings with businesspeople and
economists this week. Policy makers will &#8220;further cement and
develop the positive economic trend&#8221; amid an &#8220;extremely
complicated&#8221; domestic and global outlook, he said. 
Macquarie cut its growth estimate for China to 9.5 percent
to 10 percent from a previous 10 percent to 10.5 percent last
month and CICC said in May that growth would likely ease to 9.5
percent from a previous estimate of 10.5 percent. 
&#8220;The momentum of growth has moderated as expected, but we
do not see a sharp slowdown in China,&#8221; Liu Li-Gang, economist
at Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in Hong Kong.
&#8220;With this moderation, this will be a good thing for policy
makers that they don&#8217;t have to tighten excessively.&#8221;

Electricite de France SA, Europe&#8217;s
biggest power generator, is facing demands to justify ballooning
cost estimates for extending the lives of French nuclear
reactors as the government opens the market to competitors. 
&#8220;Many decisions will hinge on&#8221; the cost estimates,
including the rates rivals will pay for EDF electricity
supplies, Pierre-Franck Chevet, the top official at France&#8217;s
Energy Ministry, said in an interview. &#8220;We will need some
estimates to set the rates&#8221; next year, he said. 
EDF will have to spend about 600 million euros ($750
million) on each of its 58 reactors to keep them in service for
longer, according to Chief Executive Officer Henri Proglio.
That&#8217;s 50 percent more than an estimate given earlier this year.
The utility will have to fork out almost 35 billion euros in 20
years to keep aging plants in working order, the CEO has said. 
Cost estimates have taken on greater urgency as lawmakers
study a planned electricity market law that may force EDF to
sell about a quarter of the power from its nuclear reactors to
GDF Suez SA and others. The law, in the Senate after approval by
the National Assembly last month, follows probes by European
Union regulators into EDF&#8217;s dominance in the French market. 
While the work on EDF&#8217;s reactors won&#8217;t start until the next
decade, the government needs rough cost estimates to calculate
the wholesale power rates the utility can charge rivals on what
may be as much as 100 terawatt-hours a year. The price will be
set by the government in consultation with the energy regulator
after the law is passed. 
Explain Costs 
The ministry has ordered state-owned EDF to spell out costs
to upgrade the French plants, which are on average 24 years old,
Chevet said. 
Extending French reactor operations will be &#8220;one of the
most important issues for the next two or three years,&#8221; Chevet
said. &#8220;I do not know the basis of the 400 million euros or the
600 million euros at this stage.&#8221; 
EDF&#8217;s 30-year-old French nuclear reactors are now
undergoing inspections by the Autorite de Surete Nucleaire,
France&#8217;s nuclear safety watchdog, to determine whether they can
operate for another decade. 
Keeping them going for more than four decades would be
cheaper than building new ones, such as the EPR model the
utility is developing for 4 billion euros in Flamanville,
Normandy. 
Precise Information 
&#8220;We want this examined in-depth,&#8221; Chevet said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not simple, there are a lot of technical issues.&#8221; Getting more
precise information could take at least a year and will depend
on how long EDF wants to operate the reactors. 
Proglio has described the proposed power law as
&#8220;expropriation&#8221; and warned against the &#8220;pillage&#8221; of the
utility by setting the price too low. At a Senate hearing last
month, Proglio said the minimum price should be 42 euros a
megawatt hour, which should be &#8220;progressively&#8221; raised to 45
euros a megawatt-hour to include costs of extending the lives of
French reactors. 
French regulated rates for households currently assume EDF
base power supply costs of about 34 megawatts an hour. EDF&#8217;s
rivals say that is about where the wholesale price should be set
to enable them to compete on that market. 
GDF Suez, the former French gas monopoly which operates
seven reactors in Belgium, has estimated costs to extend the
lifetime of its reactors at about 400 million euros each,
although this has to be evaluated plant by plant and depends on
the extension, Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet said
this week following a hearing at the French Senate. 
Industrial Challenge 
&#8220;Extending the lives of nuclear reactors is an industrial
challenge and it&#8217;s to be expected that the wholesale price will
permit this when the time comes, and I repeat when the time
comes,&#8221; Mestrallet told lawmakers. 
Making rivals pay up front for the costs isn&#8217;t right, he
said. EDF&#8217;s share price could rise or fall by 1.50 euros for
each year the average lifetime of the reactors is extended or
reduced, according to Louis Boujard, an analyst at Aurel BGC in
Paris. 
&#8220;EDF must come up with a solid case,&#8221; to justify the cost
estimates, Chevet said. &#8220;The costs depend a lot on the extent
of the extension that is envisaged.&#8221;

India&#8217;s current-account deficit may
&#8220;remain high&#8221; this year as economic growth boosts imports,
adding pressure on the rupee to weaken in the near term, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. 
&#8220;There are near-term weakening pressures on the rupee
exacerbated by external uncertainties,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
economists Pranjul Bhandari and Tushar Poddar wrote in a report
to clients yesterday. 
The current-account gap, a measure of trade and investment
flows, widened to a record $13 billion in the quarter through
March, the central bank said June 30, sending the rupee headed
to its biggest weekly loss in a month. The currency slid 0.7
percent this week to 46.625 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. in Mumbai. 
The Reserve Bank of India yesterday said India has become
more vulnerable to slowdowns and financial crises abroad as
foreign trade plays a bigger role in the economy. Trade
represented 35 percent of gross domestic product in the year
ended March 31, 2008, from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank. 
Goldman economists expect the rupee to gain over a six-to-
12-month period as faster growth attracts foreign investments. 
Goldman forecasts the rupee to touch 47.5 against the
dollar in three months, 46 in six months and 44.5 in a year,
according to the note. 
India&#8217;s $1.2 trillion economy may expand 8.5 percent in the
year ending March 31, from 7.4 percent in the previous year,
according to the finance ministry.

The most-accurate forecasters of
Asian currencies say it&#8217;s time to avoid the South Korean won and
the Indian rupee as the global economic recovery falters. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which correctly predicted the
Malaysian ringgit&#8217;s gain this year, has stopped recommending the
region&#8217;s currencies and says the rupee will drop 2 percent this
quarter. ING Groep NV, which had the closest forecasts for the
weakening won and Taiwan dollar, is among the most bearish for
their second-half performance. 
Strategists got it wrong at the start of the year when the
consensus in Bloomberg surveys was that the won would appreciate
the most in Asia and the ringgit would be the region&#8217;s weakest
currency. Instead, South Korea&#8217;s currency dropped 5 percent and
Malaysia&#8217;s climbed 7 percent. Now, Invesco Ltd. and Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which together manage $482 billion, are
avoiding the region&#8217;s higher-yielding assets as Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis spreads. 
&#8220;Episodes of risk aversion will see the won and rupee
underperform and give strong support to the dollar,&#8221; Tim Condon,
chief Asia economist in Singapore for ING, the biggest Dutch
financial services company, said in an interview yesterday.
&#8220;They may appreciate as markets calm down, but the path won&#8217;t
be smooth.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s Premier Wen Jiabao said on July 3 that the effects
of the global financial turmoil are more severe than expected,
after a Federation of Logistics  Purchasing report showed
manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in June. Markit
Economics reported on July 5 that expansion in Europe&#8217;s services
and manufacturing industries also weakened for a second month. 
Contagion Effect 
The won slumped 8 percent in the past three months to
1,222.3 per dollar, the worst performer in Asia, while the
Indian rupee declined 5 percent to 46.905. Financial-market
&#8220;stresses&#8221; may damp global economic activity in the second
half, the International Monetary Fund said on June 16, before
releasing forecasts this month. In April, the IMF projected
Asia&#8217;s 8.7 percent expansion this year would lead 4.2 percent
growth worldwide. 
China&#8217;s property market is beginning a &#8220;collapse&#8221; that
will hit the nation&#8217;s banking system, Kenneth Rogoff, the
Harvard University professor and former chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund, said in an interview in Hong Kong
yesterday. He said the global economic recovery is &#8220;very
slow.&#8221; 
&#8220;Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has some contagion effect on Asian
currencies,&#8221; said Paul Chan, Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Invesco, which oversees $430 billion globally. &#8220;It
was a trigger for outflows of hot money.&#8221; 
Downgrading Forecasts 
The won is the most exposed to changes in investor appetite
for riskier assets. Its correlation in the past year to the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of
U.S. share-price swings, was Asia&#8217;s highest at 0.75, followed by
the rupee&#8217;s at 0.66. A reading of 1 suggests movement in
lockstep. The ringgit&#8217;s relationship was the lowest at minus
0.02. The won&#8217;s one-month implied volatility, used to calculate
foreign-exchange options, is the highest among Asian currencies
at 17 percent. 
ING says the won will rise 6 percent in the rest of 2010 to
1,150, more bearish than the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 19 economists for an 11 percent gain. There&#8217;s a risk
it may end at 1,200, an increase of less than 2 percent, Condon
said. The company predicts the ringgit will decline to 3.27 from
3.23 this quarter and the rupee to 46.50 from 46.46. 
Spending Power 
Standard Chartered Plc, which had the same won forecast as
ING at the start of 2010, is more bullish, predicting the
currency will rally 11 percent to 1,100 as the yuan&#8217;s
appreciation makes Korean exports more affordable for Chinese
consumers. China&#8217;s currency has gained 0.7 percent since the
central bank ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19. 
&#8220;Robust regional growth should in particular favor
countries like Malaysia and Korea that are closely integrated to
the broader region,&#8221; Michael Hasenstab, who oversees the $34
billion Templeton Global Bond Fund in San Mateo, California,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. &#8220;The yuan still
remains undervalued.&#8221; 
Michael Buchanan, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Goldman
Sachs in Hong Kong, advises against buying Asian currencies. The
New York-based bank, which along with Barclays Plc and Danske
Bank A/S was among the three best ringgit forecasters, lowered
its 2010 economic growth forecast for China to 10.1 percent from
11.4 percent on July 2. 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a good time to be long these currencies,&#8221;
Buchanan said in a June 30 interview. &#8220;For most cases, there is
still room for appreciation but the risk-reward doesn&#8217;t
entice.&#8221; 
Cutting Forecasts 
Goldman Sachs in a June report dropped its forecast for the
rupee to 47.50 by September, from an earlier prediction of 44.
It cut its prediction for the won to 1,150 from 1,100, and for
the ringgit to 3.15 from 3.10. 
Goldman, ING and Standard Chartered are all bearish on the
rupee, after the current-account deficit widened to a record and
investors sold India&#8217;s stocks. The current-account gap reached
$13 billion in the first quarter, from $12.2 billion in the
fourth, which is &#8220;not what the market is looking for,&#8221;
Goldman&#8217;s Buchanan said. 
Foreign investors sold a net $5.4 billion of stocks in
South Korea in May and $2 billion in India. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not very confident on Asian currencies at the moment
as it depends very much on global risk sentiment,&#8221; said Kei Katayama, who helps oversee the equivalent of $37 billion in
non-yen debt as leader of the foreign fixed-income group in
Tokyo at Daiwa SB.

General Motors Co. expects sales in
Brazil to grow by 68 percent to 1 million vehicles by 2014 as
growth in Latin America&#8217;s largest economy stokes demand for
fancier cars, said the automaker&#8217;s South America chief. 
&#8220;Brazilians are getting richer and the currency is
stronger,&#8221; Jaime Ardila, head of GM South America, said in an
interview. The country will make a &#8220;significant contribution to
the company&#8217;s profits&#8221; in the next few years, he said. 
GM predicts that sales of Chevrolets in Brazil will rise to
650,000 vehicles this year from almost 600,000 in 2009, and then
surge to the 1 million mark in 2014, Ardila said. The Detroit-
based automaker plans to increase deliveries &#8220;in line with the
market or a little bit ahead&#8221; as total Brazilian car sales
advance to 4 million in 2014, he said. 
GM is investing more than 5 billion reais ($2.8 billion) in
Brazil through 2012 as a burgeoning middle class, a strong
currency and more jobs spur demand for cars, Ardila said. The
country&#8217;s gross domestic product will rise 7.2 percent this
year, according to a central bank survey published yesterday. 
&#8220;South America is perhaps one of the most important assets
and best returns on investment that GM has,&#8221; Ardila said in the
July 2 interview in Paris, where he was attending an Economist
conference. GM is focusing the investment on product development
and spending 1.4 billion reais on two plants in the state of
Sao Paulo to increase production.

Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s Japanese unit and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA may have to spend billions of dollars
upgrading plants or else shut units because of new rules aimed
at boosting heavy-oil refining, analysts said. 
The regulations require refiners to increase the proportion
of gasoline and gasoil they produce from residues, which are
cheaper than lighter crudes, Trade Minister Masayuki Naoshima
said yesterday. The move may force the nation&#8217;s fuel producers
to cut capacity by 800,000 barrels a day, or 17 percent, as they
opt to mothball plants rather than carry out costly upgrades,
said Hidetoshi Shioda, a senior energy analyst at Mizuho
Securities Co. 
The rules are meant to compel Japanese refiners to
modernize refineries or cut capacity in an oversupplied market
so they can compete more effectively with Asian rivals,
according to the trade ministry. About 10 percent of the
country&#8217;s capacity is dedicated to heavy oil processing,
compared with 36 percent in China and an Asian average of 19
percent, the ministry said in April. 
Exxon&#8217;s unit, Tonengeneral Sekiyu K.K., Cosmo Oil Co. and
the Brazilian company known as Petrobras stand to lose the most
because they have low ratios of residue-refining capacity to
crude distillation, said Osamu Fujisawa a Tokyo-based oil
economist at industry consultant FE Associates. 
&#8220;Given the bleak prospects for Japan&#8217;s fuel demand, these
refiners aren&#8217;t likely to spend large sums of money on upgrades
but will instead downsize plants,&#8221; Fujisawa said. 
Low Ratios 
Kosuke Kai, a spokesman for ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha, which
holds a 50 percent stake in Tonen, said the company is reviewing
the new regulations and declined to comment further. Nelson
Toyomura, a spokesman for Petrobras unit Nansei Sekiyu, said the
company hasn&#8217;t determined what to do with its 100,000 barrel-a-
day plant on Okinawa island. 
Cosmo Oil spokesman Katsuhisa Maeda said he&#8217;s not sure how
the company will deal with the new rules. The Tokyo-based
refiner, 21 percent owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, has
started internal talks to decide how to make its refineries
competitive. 
Companies whose ratio of residue refining to crude
distillation is less than 10 percent will need to increase the
proportion by 45 percent by March 2014, according to the new
rules. Nansei Sekiyu, Cosmo Oil and TonenGeneral all fall into
that category, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
refinery data compiled by the Petroleum Association of Japan. 
Showa Shell 
Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will be the least affected among
Japanese refiners as it already has a relatively high ratio of
residue-processing capacity, said Hirofumi Kawachi, a senior
energy analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. 
The company has 88,000 barrels a day residue-processing
capacity compared with 515,000 barrels a day of crude
distillation, a ratio of about 17 percent, according to the
company&#8217;s website. That proportion will climb to 22 percent when
the company makes good on plans to shut permanently a 120,000
barrel-a-day crude unit by September 2011. 
Refiners with a ratio between 10 percent and 13 percent
need to boost the proportion by 30 percent, and those with more
than 13 percent must increase the ratio by 15 percent, the trade
minister said in its announcement on July 5. 
Residue processing facilities such as coker units and
residue fluid catalytic crackers that can produce gasoline and
gasoil components from fuel oil cost around 100 billion yen
($1.1 billion) to build, making them too costly to be viable in
a market where fuel demand is declining, said Yuji Nishiyama, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. 
Japan&#8217;s domestic demand for fuels is likely to decline at a
rate of 3.5 percent a year through March 2015 because of a
shrinking population and a shift to energy conservation,
according to the trade ministry. 
&#8220;The refiners may have to make more cuts if local demand
falls faster and steeper in the next decade,&#8221; said Shioda of
Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

Walt Disney Co. was found liable for
not paying the U.K. creators of &#8220;Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire&#8221; their share of profits from the quiz show
broadcast on Disney&#8217;s ABC network. 
A jury in Riverside, California, today awarded $269.4
million in damages to Celador International Ltd. The jurors
agreed that Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television and ABC breached an
agreement that entitled Celador to 50 percent of the profits
from the show, which first aired in the U.S. in 1999 and helped
lift the network to first place from third in audience ratings. 
&#8220;We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will
aggressively seek to have it reversed,&#8221; Disney said in an
e-mailed statement. 
Closely held Celador sued Disney in 2004, claiming Buena
Vista and ABC &#8220;through a complex web of self-dealing
transactions&#8221; allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and
pay Buena Vista only a licensing fee equal to the cost of
producing the show. That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit
from &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; that it would have had to share, Celador
said. 
&#8220;The moral of the story is people should honor their
contracts and treat others fairly,&#8221; Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer
for Celador, said outside the courtroom. &#8220;That is what this
jury said today. Even Disney is not immune.&#8221; 
Third-Biggest Verdict 
The verdict is the third-largest jury award in the U.S.
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Major studios have taken a hard line defending lawsuits
over profits and Disney in particular is notorious for its
aggressive legal strategy, said Michael Kump, a partner with
Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump  Aldisert in Santa Monica,
California, who has litigated cases against Disney. 
&#8220;Studios have been very reluctant to settle these kind of
cases,&#8221; Kump said in a phone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re afraid of
setting a precedent and have every profit participant come after
them.&#8221; 
To succeed on appeal, Disney will have to show that the
trial judge erred, possibly in instructing the jurors, Kump
said. Appellate courts generally are reluctant to overturn jury
verdicts, the lawyer said. 
Disney, based in Burbank, California, argued that the
creators, who received a flat producers&#8217; fee for each episode,
knew that the network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t generate a
profit. There wasn&#8217;t anything unusual or secret about the way
Buena Vista and ABC, which took all the financial risks, divided
the rights, said Disney lawyer Martin Katz during the trial. 
Iger&#8217;s Criticism 
Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said the judge
and the jury got it wrong and should have had more opportunity
to review the contract. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all there in the contract,&#8221; Iger said today in an
interview at the Allen  Co. media conference in Sun Valley,
Idaho. 
The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and its
success prompted ABC to run the program four times a week.
&#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998 and has
been carried in 106 countries, including Australia, India,
Japan, Germany and Russia, according to the creators. The show
also was featured in the movie &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire,&#8221; which
was co-produced by Celador and which won eight Oscars in 2009. 
Eisner E-Mail 
Former Disney Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner said
in a 1999 e-mail introduced by Celador as evidence in the trial
that &#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; was as important to
Disney&#8217;s ABC network as its deal with the National Football
League. 
Eisner estimated the value of the rights to the game show
at $1 billion and said it would turn ABC around, according to a
separate 1999 e-mail message forwarded to Disney&#8217;s board of
directors. 
Celador Chairman Paul Smith said in a phone interview that
the verdict was a great relief and that the company had been
willing to settle the case before it went to trial. 
&#8220;Disney did a fine, fine job producing and exploiting the
show,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;The problem was they exploited it for
their own benefit only.&#8221; 
The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.
04-03541, U.S. District Court, Central District of California

Hercules Offshore Inc., owner of the
largest fleet of shallow-water drilling rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico, said its Hercules 120 rig began a well for Chevron Corp.
after receiving a federal permit. 
Chevron yesterday revoked a June 23 notice that new
drilling rules following a Gulf of Mexico oil spill might cause
it to cancel its contract for the rig under a legal provision
known as force majeure, Houston-based Hercules said today in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Drilling began July 2, Hercules said. 
President Barack Obama suspended permits to drill in more
than 500 feet (152 meters) of water after the April 20 blowout
of the BP Plc well in the Gulf of Mexico. The administration on
June 8 tightened safety standards for drilling in waters less
than 500 feet deep. The Chevron permit is the 15th under the
revised shallow-water rules and the fourth for a new well,
Hercules General Counsel Jim Noe said. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s an encouraging first step,&#8221; Noe said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s flow of permits that&#8217;s needed, not a trickle.
There are 50 available rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that are
working well-to-well and they continually need permits at a rate
of about 10 to 15 per week, not a handful every couple of
months.&#8221; 
The permit issued to Chevron by the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, successor to the regulatory arm of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, is for a well in water 61 feet deep off
Louisiana, Noe said. 
Jack-Up Rigs 
Hercules has 30 jack-up rigs, according to its website.
Jack-ups are mobile drilling rigs that extend legs to the ocean
floor in shallow waters. Two others are under contract to
Chevron, one of which is finishing a well in Louisiana state
waters and the other is ready to start a well, Noe said. 
Margaret J. Cooper, a spokeswoman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, had no immediate comment on the
Hercules filing. 
About one in three shallow-water rigs in the Gulf are idle,
double the normal rate, Noe said in an interview last week. 
Hercules rose 26 cents, or 11 percent, to $2.54 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq trading. It has fallen 42 percent since the BP well
blowout, which caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history. 
Chevron rose $1.89, or 2.8 percent, to $69.45 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are down 9.8
percent this year.

     August, 2010 (Bloomberg Markets) -- Amid a storm of
criticism, government investigations and an SEC suit, the
investment bank&#8217;s outside directors have failed to speak out. 
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. general counsel, took a
call in his 37th-floor office at One New York Plaza on Dec. 16,
2008. It was his old boss, Stephen Friedman, a former Goldman
chairman who was then head of the audit committee of its board
of directors. Goldman&#8217;s stock was down 65 percent from its 52-
week high during an accelerating global financial breakdown. 
Friedman, who had become chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that year, told Palm he wanted to buy,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its August issue. 
Palm says he couldn&#8217;t think of a reason why Friedman
shouldn&#8217;t: Goldman had made the necessary disclosures in that
day&#8217;s filings, Palm says. 
&#8220;We&#8217;d just reported earnings,&#8221; says Palm, whose job
includes approving trades by directors. &#8220;There was no material
information that wasn&#8217;t public from Goldman&#8217;s standpoint.&#8221; 
Friedman, 72, who is still a Goldman director, bought
37,300 shares at an average of $80.78 each on Dec. 17. Five
weeks later, he picked up 15,300 more at an average of $66.61.
By yesterday, the stock had doubled to $133.76, giving Friedman
a paper profit of $3 million. 
Now, the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee is investigating Friedman&#8217;s stock purchases. It wants
to know why he was permitted to buy stock in a bank he was
regulating as chairman of the New York Fed. 
Friedman held both that post and his Goldman board seat
when the firm became a bank holding company in September 2008.
The Federal Reserve Act forbids an official at the New York Fed
in his position from also being a director of a bank or buying
its stock. 
&#8216;Perfectly Legal&#8217; 
The New York Fed sought a waiver from the Federal Reserve
Board in September 2008 so that Friedman could keep his position
there. Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Friedman, says New York
Fed general counsel Tom Baxter told Friedman that the rules were
in abeyance while the waiver was pending. 
&#8220;Therefore, Mr. Friedman&#8217;s purchases of Goldman Sachs
stock were perfectly legal,&#8221; she says. The waiver was granted
in January 2009. 
Jerry Jordan, a former president of the Cleveland Fed, says
the section of the Federal Reserve Act barring Friedman from
owning bank stock or buying new shares could not be waived. &#8220;It
was not allowed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You can&#8217;t get permission to
violate the law.&#8221; 
Keeping Mum 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s ties to the New York Fed pose another
potential conflict for Friedman, says James Cox, a professor at
Duke University School of Law. Goldman was a prime beneficiary
of the New York Fed-engineered bailout of American International
Group Inc.&#8217;s bank counterparties, receiving, by its own count,
$12.9 billion for the credit protection it held on mortgage-
related securities. That figure was not publicly disclosed by
AIG until March 2009 -- after Friedman had bought his shares. 
&#8220;It raises at the least an eyebrow in terms of what he
knew about those payments,&#8221; Cox says. 
New York Fed spokesman Jack Gutt responds: &#8220;Friedman had
no involvement in nor was he provided with confidential
information related to the New York Fed&#8217;s negotiation with any
AIG counterparties.&#8221; 
Friedman resigned from the New York Fed on May 7, 2009,
days after the Wall Street Journal reported his stock buying. At
the time, Baxter said in a statement, &#8220;It is my view that these
purchases did not violate any Federal Reserve statute, rule or
policy.&#8221; 
As the Friedman saga unfolds -- and Goldman&#8217;s regulatory
and legal entanglements escalate -- the firm&#8217;s nine outside
directors, who aren&#8217;t Goldman employees, are keeping mum. 
&#8216;Completely Unfounded&#8217; 
The board members said nothing publicly, for instance,
when on April 16 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filed a civil suit alleging Goldman had committed fraud in
underwriting and marketing a mortgage-related security called
Abacus 2007-AC1 without disclosing to clients that a bearish
hedge fund customer, Paulson  Co., was involved in creating it. 
Goldman calls the SEC suit &#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; 
Federal prosecutors in New York are also investigating
Goldman transactions to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Nell Minow, co-founder of the Portland, Maine-based
Corporate Library, a governance research firm, says that when
the SEC suit was filed, the outside directors should have
immediately set up a committee to investigate, hired independent
counsel and announced that they would make the results of their
probe public. 
Wells Notice 
The board should also have been riding herd on its members&#8217;
stock trades, says Cornell University Law School Professor
Robert Hockett, who specializes in financial regulation from his
office in Ithaca, New York. Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag
says directors are periodically informed of such trades. The
bank received a Wells notice dated July 28, 2009, notifying the
firm that it was the target of an SEC fraud investigation. 
At least three company executives, including Vice Chairman
Michael Evans, unloaded more than $27 million of Goldman stock
from October 2009 through February 2010 in open market sales
unrelated to the recent exercise of options or delivery of
restricted stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Van Praag says Goldman&#8217;s board was informed of the Wells
notice, which was not made public until after the SEC filed its
suit. He says the firm&#8217;s lawyers determined it wasn&#8217;t material. 
&#8220;On the face of it, the idea that that would not be
material -- I can&#8217;t imagine anybody saying that with a straight
face,&#8221; Hockett says. 
11-Hour Hearing 
Jacob Zamansky of Zamansky  Associates LLC filed a class-
action lawsuit on April 30 on behalf of Goldman shareholders,
saying that Goldman made false statements relating to the SEC
suit and failed to disclose adverse facts about the company to
shareholders. 
&#8220;The Wells notice was a material fact going to the heart
of their business,&#8221; he says. Goldman had not formally responded
to the suit as of late June. 
The number of issues Goldman executives, and their board,
need to address continues to build. 
Director Rajat Gupta did not stand for re-election to the
board in May. U.S. investigators suspect him of leaking word of
a $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in
2008, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, former worldwide
managing director of McKinsey  Co., says, &#8220;Rajat Gupta has
never violated any law or rule.&#8221; 
A Billion Pages 
On April 27, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations held an 11-hour hearing on Goldman&#8217;s role in the
financial meltdown. 
&#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its own interests and profits
ahead of the interests of its clients and our communities,&#8221;
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said at the hearing. 
&#8220;We respectfully disagree,&#8221; van Praag says. 
On June 7, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
subpoenaed Goldman, accusing it of attempting to hinder its
probe of the firm by electronically sending it the equivalent of
more than a billion pages of documents. Yesterday the leaders of
the commission told journalists in a conference call that the
firm has become more responsive. 
&#8220;The outside directors haven&#8217;t been visible on any of
this,&#8221; says Patrick McGurn, special counsel at RiskMetrics
Group, a New York adviser to shareholders. &#8220;You have to ask if
it&#8217;s setting the correct ethical tone.&#8221; 
Van Praag says: &#8220;Board chairman Lloyd Blankfein has made
the views of the board well-known.&#8221; 
Speaking Out 
Goldman&#8217;s board consists of two insiders, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Blankfein and President Gary Cohn, and
nine outsiders. There are five scheduled meetings per year and
more as needed, the company says. 
The outside directors are: Friedman; Lois Juliber, 61,
former vice chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co.; William George,
67, ex-CEO of Medtronic Inc.; Lakshmi Mittal, 60, CEO of
steelmaker ArcelorMittal; John Bryan, 73, ex-CEO of Sara Lee
Corp.; Lee Scott, 61, ex-CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; Claes Dahlback, 63, ex-CEO of Sweden&#8217;s Investor AB; James Johnson, 66,
vice chairman of merchant bank Perseus LLC and former CEO of
Fannie Mae; and James Schiro, 64, former head of insurer Zurich
Financial Services AG. 
Directors who completed a full year in 2009 were paid an
average of $460,852 in stock and options compared with $255,519
in cash and stock for JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s 10 outside
directors and $337,803 for Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 11 outsiders,
proxies show. 
Goldman&#8217;s board may have been able to preempt criticism of
the company by speaking out, says Sean Coffey, a former partner
at Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann LLP, who&#8217;s running for
New York state attorney general. 
Shopping at Walmart 
The board should have established a committee of outside
directors with an independent counsel to investigate ethics
matters and get the facts, says Coffey, who won more than $50
million from WorldCom Inc. directors in a 2005 settlement with
the telecom company. 
&#8220;The right decision might be to take out advertisements
and apologize or it might be to batten down the hatches,&#8221;
Coffey says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t omit disclosing material information that
investors ought to know.&#8221; 
Minow says the Goldman board should have nominated someone
who had securities law enforcement experience, who could have
led an internal investigation. 
Instead, in March, Goldman nominated -- and shareholders
later approved -- the appointment of Walmart&#8217;s Scott. After an
exchange in which a person at the May 7 annual meeting asked how
Scott had been selected, CEO Blankfein deadpanned, &#8220;Actually, I
like shopping at Walmart.&#8221; 
Nine-Person Board 
At the meeting, Goldman announced the creation of an
internal committee that will examine possible conflicts of
interest and other issues such as transparency and disclosure.
It&#8217;s headed by Vice Chairman Evans and E. Gerald Corrigan,
chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. No board members are
involved. 
Former EBay CEO Meg Whitman, who joined Goldman&#8217;s board in
2001, says then-CEO Henry Paulson brushed aside her questions to
move a meeting along. 
&#8220;They wanted to keep acting like a group of partners who
did much of their discussion and decision-making in private and
then expected to get the board&#8217;s rubber stamp,&#8221; Whitman writes
in her new book, The Power of Many (Crown, 2010). She resigned
after 15 months. 
Whitman is now the Republican candidate for governor of
California. 
Cornell&#8217;s Hockett says that if Friedman violated any laws,
the entire Goldman board is to blame. 
&#8220;Boards are intended to police the actions of their
members,&#8221; he says. 
Class C 
Friedman spokesperson Davis says the waiver exonerates him. 
The New York Fed&#8217;s nine-person board consists of three
classes of directors serving staggered terms. Class A directors
are elected by member banks to represent commercial banks; one
class A director today is JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Class B directors are elected by member banks to
represent the public, while class C directors such as Friedman,
who also represent the public, are appointed by the Fed Board of
Governors. 
Former Cleveland Fed President Jordan says the law is
clear: As a Class C director, Friedman could not own, much less
buy, bank stock. 
Section 4, Number 15 of the Federal Reserve Act reads, &#8220;No
director of class C shall be an officer, director, employee, or
stockholder of any bank.&#8221; 
The New York Fed argued that because Goldman was a bank
holding company and not a bank, a waiver could be granted,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The Fed
agreed. 
Shares Surge 
How much the Goldman board&#8217;s silence in the face of
adversity has cost the firm is difficult to gauge. Goldman
shares have surged 157 percent as of June 29 since hitting an
all-time low in November 2008. In May, shareholders approved
those directors standing for election by margins of more than 95
percent or greater. 
Still, says Coffey, the board&#8217;s somnolence in the face of
so much controversy has done nothing to support Goldman&#8217;s
storied franchise.

(Corrects fourth paragraph to say Burkle and Weinsteins are
considering a bid.) 
Construction executive Ronald Tutor
is in discussions to buy Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s Miramax film
division, with backing from private equity firm Colony Capital,
according to two people with knowledge of the talks. 
Negotiations are continuing almost around the clock, said
one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks
are private. If consummated, an agreement could be announced by
next week, the person said. 
Tutor approached Colony prior to the July 4 weekend seeking
financing, said one person with knowledge of the arrangement.
Los Angeles-based Colony, led by chairman and CEO Tom Barrack,
has investments that include Michael Jackson&#8217;s Neverland ranch
in Santa Barbara. 
Los Angeles investor Ron Burkle and Miramax founders Harvey
and Bob Weinstein, who were working on a $625 million offer, are
weighing whether to put in a competing bid, said two other
people with knowledge of the situation. They had ended talks
with Disney in May. 
The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993. The two, who
left in 2005, control rights to some films and are acquainted
with both Tutor and Barrack, according to one of the people. 
Disney is seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax,
producer of &#8220;The English Patient&#8221; and &#8220;Shakespeare in Love,&#8221;
said one of the people. 
Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California-
based Tutor Perini Corp., didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment.
Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha declined to comment on the talks. 
Lead Negotiators 
Harvey Weinstein, in Sun Valley, Idaho, for media banker
Allen  Co.&#8217;s annual conference, declined to discuss Miramax
yesterday. 
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s better for me to not say anything,&#8221;
Weinstein said in an interview. 
Leading negotiations for Colony is Richard Nanula, who was
chief financial officer at Disney when it purchased Miramax,
said the person. Nanula is negotiating with Kevin Mayer,
Disney&#8217;s executive vice president for corporate strategy. 
The talks were reported yesterday by the Web site
Deadline.com/Hollywood and by Reuters. 
Disney gained 20 cents to $33.34 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. It has advanced 3.4 percent
this year.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest
publicly traded company, plans to buy back $3 billion of its
shares this quarter, easing the effect on shareholders from its
takeover of natural-gas producer XTO Energy Inc., and said it
will pay off or refinance the deal&#8217;s assumed debt. 
The $25 billion purchase last month increased outstanding
shares at Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, by 416 million, or
about 9 percent, David Rosenthal, vice president for investor
relations, said today during a conference call with analysts.
The company also will pay off or refinance $11 billion of
assumed debt when the opportunity presents, he said. 
The deal made Exxon Mobil the largest U.S. producer of
clean-burning gas, which Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
expects to be the fastest-growing fuel for more than two
decades. He kept almost all of XTO&#8217;s 3,300 employees and said a
team in its former Fort Worth headquarters will spend up to 18
months setting drilling priorities. 
&#8220;Now that we&#8217;ve got this in-house, we want to look at what
are the optimization steps that could be taken,&#8221; Tillerson said
on the call. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to be driven by all the aspects
that XTO standalone was.&#8221; 
Exxon Mobil is ending XTO&#8217;s practice of locking in oil and
gas prices for future production and instead will use its
traditional yardstick of return on capital, Tillerson said. At
the same time, XTO was more efficient than Exxon Mobil at
drilling onshore wells such as those in the Permian Basin of
West Texas, Tillerson said. 
Unconventional Bet 
The XTO purchase is a long-term bet that gas from shale
formations, coal seams and other so-called unconventional
sources will meet rising U.S. demand through at least 2030 as
output from conventional wells declines, Tillerson said. 
Exxon Mobil acquired the equivalent of at least 45 trillion
cubic feet of recoverable gas beneath 3.34 million U.S. acres
with the purchase, along with expertise to evaluate 4.8 million
acres of potential fields already accumulated outside the U.S.,
Tillerson said. 
The unconventional assets include oil and gas trapped in
dense, hard rock such as shale, considered not worth drilling
until Texas oil-patch billionaire George Mitchell developed
methods to extract gas economically in the 1990s. 
Exxon Mobil rose 38 cents to $58.81 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 14
percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley profit estimates were lowered by Meredith Whitney
Advisory Group LLC, following similar cuts by other research
analysts as markets fell and business demand shriveled. 
Whitney cut her estimate for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s second-quarter
earnings per share to $1.70 from an earlier forecast of $4.75
and reduced her estimate for Morgan Stanley to 40 cents from 68
cents, according to a report from her New York-based firm. 
Estimates for earnings have tumbled during recent weeks as
stock markets dropped amid a return of risk aversion by
investors. Analysts including Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga
Securities and Guy Moszkowski at Bank of America Corp. have
slashed earnings forecasts because of a lower revenue outlook
and higher costs related to legal expenses and a U.K. bonus tax. 
Whitney&#8217;s cuts are &#8220;due to a heinous trading environment&#8221;
and &#8220;lower than anticipated investment-banking activity,&#8221; she
said in the July 7 note to investors. 
The second quarter &#8220;was the worst quarter for debt and
equity underwriting volume in over a year as volatility spiked,
and global equity indices recorded the steepest quarterly
declines since&#8221; the fourth quarter 2008, she wrote. 
The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
is for New York-based Goldman Sachs to earn $2.30 per share in
the second quarter, with forecasts of $1.60 per share to $3.21
per share. Goldman Sachs earned $5.59 per share in the first
quarter of 2010 and $4.93 per share in the second quarter of
2009. 
Full-Year Estimates 
Whitney also lowered her estimates for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
third and fourth-quarter earnings to $3.77 and $4.64 from $4.24
and $5.42, respectively. She expects the firm to earn $15.70 in
2010, down from an earlier estimate of $20 a share, while the
2011 forecast was reduced to $19.50 from $22. 
The average estimate of 11 analysts is for Morgan Stanley
to earn 48 cents, with a range of 39 cents to 58 cents. Last
quarter the New York-based firm earned 82 cents a share, while
it lost $1.37 a share a year earlier. Whitney cut her full-year
2010 estimate to $2.62 per share from $2.90 and lowered the 2011
estimate to $3 from $3.05. 
Whitney has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on both Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley stock.

Walt Disney Co. was found liable for
not paying the U.K. creators of &#8220;Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire&#8221; their share of profits from the quiz show
broadcast on Disney&#8217;s ABC network. 
A federal court jury in Riverside, California, yesterday
awarded $269.4 million in damages to Celador International Ltd.
The jurors agreed that Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television and ABC
breached an agreement that entitled Celador to 50 percent of the
profits from the show, which first aired in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift the network to first place from third in audience
ratings. 
&#8220;We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will
aggressively seek to have it reversed,&#8221; Disney said in an e-
mailed statement. 
Closely held Celador sued Disney in 2004, claiming Buena
Vista and ABC &#8220;through a complex web of self-dealing
transactions&#8221; allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and
pay Buena Vista only a licensing fee equal to the cost of
producing the show. That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit
from &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; that it would have had to share, Celador
said. 
Disney, based in Burbank, California, argued that the
creators, who received a flat producers&#8217; fee for each episode,
knew that the network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t generate a
profit. There wasn&#8217;t anything unusual or secret about the way
Buena Vista and ABC, which took all the financial risks, divided
the rights, said Disney lawyer Martin Katz during the trial. 
The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.

Trials/Appeals 
Two Former Marsh Executives&#8217; Convictions Tossed in Bid-Rig Case 
A New York judge threw out the criminal convictions against
two former Marsh  McLennan Cos. executives whom he found guilty
of restraint of trade in 2008. 
State Supreme Court Justice James Yates in Manhattan tossed
the convictions against William Gilman and Edward McNenney,
former managing directors at Marsh, in a July 2 written
decision. The pair were accused of fixing prices to steer
business to insurers that paid Marsh hidden fees from November
1998 to September 2004. 
The decision was the latest loss for the New York Attorney
General&#8217;s office in its six-year probe of anti-competitive sales
practices in the insurance industry. The case, begun under
former state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, was tried under his
successor, Andrew Cuomo. 
Failures by prosecutors, including &#8220;newly discovered
contradictory evidence, undermines the court&#8217;s confidence in the
verdict,&#8221; Yates wrote in his decision. 
Yates found the two men guilty in February 2008 of a single
count of restraint of trade under New York&#8217;s antitrust statutes
after a 10-month trial. 
&#8220;We are reviewing the decision and contemplating an
appeal,&#8221; Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Cuomo, said in an
e-mailed statement. 
The attorney general&#8217;s office, following a 2004 probe,
alleged that McNenney, Gilman and six other Marsh Global Broking
Inc. brokers took part in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain
millions of dollars for Marsh and its accomplice companies by
rigging the market for excess casualty insurance, according to a
redacted copy of the 25-page decision. 
Gilman, formerly Marsh&#8217;s executive marketing director and
managing director, and McNenney, the former global placement
director and managing director, worked in the Excess Casualty
Unit of Marsh Global Broking, a Marsh Inc. unit. 
In January, Yates allowed former Marsh employees Robert
Stearns and Kathryn Winter and former Zurich Financial Services
AG employee James Spiegel to withdraw their guilty pleas to
felony charges of participating in a scheme to defraud. The
judge agreed to reduce the charges to misdemeanors and said he
would dismiss the charges if the three abided by plea
agreements. Yates also dismissed charges against six people who
previously pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges related to
alleged bid-rigging. 
The case is People of the State of New York v. Doherty,
04800-2005, New York State Supreme Court, County of New York

Stanford Professor Stung by Fund Wins $2.2 Million From Bank 
A First Republic Bank unit was ordered to pay a retired
Stanford University professor and his wife $2.18 million after
arbitrators found the firm gave them only a &#8220;fleeting and
slapdash&#8221; explanation of a municipal bond fund that imploded
during the credit crisis in 2008. 
Eight months after Elliott and Rhoda Levinthal entrusted $3
million to a leveraged investment vehicle called TW Tax
Advantaged Fund LLC, it collapsed, an American Arbitration
Association panel wrote in a July 2 ruling. Evidence shows
workers at First Republic didn&#8217;t try to fully grasp risks in the
fund they designed, the panel found. The firm also inadequately
trained a saleswoman who dealt with the Levinthals, and didn&#8217;t
ensure they understood the investment. 
The education offered to the Levinthals &#8220;was fleeting and
slapdash,&#8221; arbitrators wrote. &#8220;An investment in a highly
complex and concededly risky product like the fund, sold in this
fashion, is by definition unsuitable&#8221; for someone with their
experience and objectives. 
Greg Berardi, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based
company, declined to comment. Bank of America Corp. acquired
First Republic Bank while buying Merrill Lynch  Co. last year,
and sold it last week to an investor group that included founder
James H. Herbert II. 
Elliott Levinthal, 88, is a professor emeritus of
mechanical engineering at Stanford. He and his wife endowed
Levinthal Hall, a lecture hall at the Stanford Humanities
Center. 
The panel ordered First Republic Securities to pay the
couple and their trust $2.1 million in compensatory damages,
plus $78,153 in fees and expenses. 
About 35 retail mutual funds marketed as leveraged
municipal arbitrage strategies have failed in recent years, said
Craig McCann of the Securities and Litigation Consulting Group
Inc., a Virginia consulting firm that testified for the
Levinthals in the arbitration. Brokerage firms sold the funds as
&#8220;higher-yielding alternatives to conventional municipal bond
portfolios with little, if any risk,&#8221; he said in a 2009 report. 
Skilled Healthcare Falls After $671 Million Verdict 
Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. plunged the most since its
initial public offering in New York trading after a California
jury returned a $671 million jury verdict against the nursing-
home operator. 
Skilled Healthcare dropped $4.70, or 76 percent, to $1.52
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the largest intraday
decline since the shares went on sale in May 2007. They peaked
in August 2008 at $17.17. 
The plaintiffs accused Skilled Healthcare of improperly
staffing 22 California facilities. A Humboldt County jury July 6
found the company liable for $613 million in statutory damages,
the maximum allowed by state law, and $58 million for
restitution. Skilled Healthcare, based in Foothill Ranch,
California, said yesterday it will appeal. 
&#8220;We strongly disagree with the outcome of this legal
matter and we intend to vigorously challenge it,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Boyd Hendrickson said in a statement. The
company believes &#8220;our facilities are appropriately staffed,&#8221;
he said. 
The verdict is the largest jury award in the U.S. this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Skilled
Healthcare said the award exceeds the policy limits of its
insurance. The jury will return later to determine punitive
damages, said the company, which posted a net loss of $133
million last year on revenue of $759.8 million. 
The lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of current and
former residents of 22 Skilled Healthcare operations in
California, plaintiffs&#8217; attorney Tim Needham said. California
law requires nursing homes to maintain staff at a rate of 3.2
nursing hours per patient per day, he said. 
The case is Lavender v. Skilled Healthcare Group, DR060264,
Superior Court, Humboldt County, California (Eureka).

Gulf Drilling Ban Should Be Restored, U.S. Argues 
A three-judge appeals panel will hear arguments from the
U.S. government today on whether a six-month moratorium on deep-
water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico should be reinstated after
a lower court judge threw out the ban. 
The government is seeking to delay an order by U.S.
District Judge Martin Feldman that scrapped the six-month
drilling moratorium, imposed May 27 after the explosion and
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April. 
Feldman&#8217;s June 22 ruling came in a lawsuit against U.S.
regulators by oil service companies claiming the drilling
suspension would cause them irreparable economic harm. The ban&#8217;s
potential economic impact is outweighed by the risk of another
spill, lawyers for the Interior Department argued in court
papers filed before a hearing set for this afternoon in New
Orleans. 
&#8220;If in Interior&#8217;s judgment, drilling poses a threat of
serious or irreparable environmental harm, the public interest
in avoiding that threat would trump economic considerations in
the short term,&#8221; the government said in a July 6 filing. 
The Interior Department asked the appeals court to stay
Feldman&#8217;s order and keep the moratorium in place long enough for
regulators to appeal. 
Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. and more than a dozen other
offshore service and supply companies sued U.S. regulators,
including Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar, last month,
seeking to block the moratorium. 
The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The appeal case is 10-30585, 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals (New Orleans). 
New Suits 
HSBC Sued for Fraud Over Credit-Card Protection Plan 
Units of HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest lender by
market value, were sued by U.S. customers who said the bank&#8217;s
credit-card payment-protection service defrauds disabled,
retired and unemployed consumers. 
While the service purports to safeguard accounts by
suspending or canceling required minimum payments when customers
become disabled or unemployed, the circumstances that trigger
protection are &#8220;varied, complicated and always changing,&#8221;
according to complaints filed July 2 against HSBC units in
federal courts in Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. 
The bank enrolls people before sending them restrictions in
small print that are &#8220;incomplete, indecipherable, misleading
and obfuscatory,&#8221; the complaints said. The plan, which costs
$1.35 per $100 of a month-ending credit-card balance, excludes
the self-employed, part-time workers, retired people and those
who are already unemployed or on disability, the customers said. 
Kate Durham, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC, said the
bank doesn&#8217;t comment on legal matters. 
&#8220;The payment protection device is designed to prey on the
financially insecure and is virtually worthless because of the
numerous restrictions that are imposed,&#8221; according to the
complaints. 
The Camden complaint, brought by Marilyn Rizera, said HSBC
Bank USA Inc. and HSBC Card Services Inc. are violating the New
Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and engaged in breach of contract. The
Philadelphia case, by Edward T. Esslinger, Gloria Glover and
Adrath Rogers, said the bank is violating the Pennsylvania
Unfair Practices and Consumer Protection Law.Both seek to
proceed as group, or class-action, lawsuits. 
&#8220;Payment Protection is so confusing as to when coverage is
triggered, so restricted in terms of the benefits it provides to
subscribers, and processing claims is made so difficult by HSBC,
that the product is essentially worthless,&#8221; according to
Rizera&#8217;s complaint. 
The cases are Rizera v. HSBC Bank USA Inc., 10-cv-3375,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden); and
Esslinger v. HSBC Bank Services, 10-cv-3213, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). 
Carlyle Group Sued by Mortgage Bond Fund Liquidator over Losses 
Carlyle Group, the world&#8217;s second-largest private-equity
firm, was sued by liquidators of the buyout firm&#8217;s defunct
mortgage bond fund, saying executives lost $945 million in
overly risky investments. 
Liquidators for Carlyle Capital Corp. Ltd, a Guernsey,
Channel Islands-based hedge fund that collapsed in March 2008,
contend Carlyle directors turned a blind eye to questionable
investments in residential mortgage-backed securities and failed
to stop the loss of all the company&#8217;s capital, according to a
lawsuit filed in Delaware. 
&#8220;In the short space of eight months, the entirety of CCC&#8217;s
capital was spectacularly lost under the reckless and grossly
negligent direction, supervision, management and advice of the
defendants,&#8221; the liquidators said in the suit, filed yesterday
in Delaware Chancery Court. 
Lenders seized Carlyle Capital&#8217;s assets after it failed to
meet more than $400 million of margin calls on mortgage-backed
collateral that had plunged in value. Carlyle Group, co-founded
by David Rubenstein, wound up the fund seven months after its
initial public offering. 
Carlyle Group officials said they&#8217;d defend themselves in
court over the fund liquidators&#8217; claims. The liquidators also
filed suit over the investment losses in state court in
Manhattan yesterday. 
&#8220;We will vigorously contest all claims and are confident
we will prevail,&#8221; Chris Ullman, a company spokesman, said. 
Carlyle Capital raised $945 million in equity funding and
sought to generate annual returns of at least 12 percent by
investing in residential mortgage backed securities and
&#8220;leveraged finance assets,&#8221; the liquidators&#8217; lawyers said in
the suit. 
The company&#8217;s business model called for leverage equaling
19 times capital, the complaint said, adding that the actual
leverage employed exceeded 30 times capital. 
Mortgage securities were among the biggest contributors to
writedowns and credit losses of almost $1.8 trillion since the
start of 2007 at the world&#8217;s largest banks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
The case is Carlyle Capital Corp. Ltd. v. William Elias
Conway Jr., CA5625, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). 
Firearms Sellers, CME Trader Sue Chicago Over Gun-Control Law 
A Chicago Mercantile Exchange trader and three other people
have joined with the Illinois Association of Firearms Retailers
to sue the city of Chicago over a restrictive gun law passed by
its legislators last week. 
The gun-owning plaintiffs, who include a teacher&#8217;s aide and
a married couple, claim the new ordinance restricting handgun
possession to inside the home and mandating firearms training
and permitting is unconstitutional. 
The measure imposes &#8220;new restrictions that have the
purpose and effect of preventing plaintiffs and other law-
abiding residents of Chicago from exercising their fundamental
right to keep and carry firearms for self defense and other
lawful purposes,&#8221; the plaintiffs said in a complaint filed July
6 in the city&#8217;s federal courthouse. 
Ruling in a case challenging Chicago&#8217;s earlier ban on
handgun possession, a divided U.S. Supreme Court on June 28 said
the constitutional right to bear arms binds states and
municipalities. 
Chicago&#8217;s new law was passed by the city council 45-0 four
days later. Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city&#8217;s law
department, said in an e-mailed message that the office had just
received a copy of the complaint and is reviewing it. She said
she couldn&#8217;t otherwise immediately comment. The high court
decision &#8220;effectively overturned&#8221; the city&#8217;s handgun ban,
Mayor Richard M. Daley said in a July 2 press statement
announcing the new ordinance. He is a named defendant in the
lawsuit. 
The retailer&#8217;s association, based in Carbondale, Illinois,
claims it has members who want to sell guns and operate firing
ranges within the city, yet can&#8217;t because of the law. 
The plaintiffs seek a court order declaring the
restrictions unconstitutional. 
The case is Benson v. City of Chicago, 10cv4184, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).

With the millions he made peddling
fake Viagra, Martin Hickman bought a beachside villa on Spain&#8217;s
Costa del Sol, a diamond-studded Rolex and a flat in London.
Pfizer Inc. aims to make sure he never gets to enjoy them. 
The spoils of Hickman&#8217;s crimes helped settle a trademark
infringement lawsuit brought by the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker
three years ago. It&#8217;s the biggest example of a new approach
Pfizer is taking to fight counterfeiting of prescription drugs,
an industry that&#8217;s almost doubled to $75 billion in five years,
according to the New York-based Center for Medicine in the
Public Interest. 
Pfizer, whose erectile dysfunction pill Viagra is one of
the most copied medicines, once relied on local authorities and
criminal courts to hunt down offenders. Now it&#8217;s hired former
U.S. customs officials, FBI agents, Turkish narcotics experts
and Hong Kong police to find counterfeiters. In China, they&#8217;re
tracking fakes to the source, raiding derelict warehouses for
evidence of illegal drug-making. In the U.K., they&#8217;re using
civil courts to hit fake pill peddlers where it hurts most. 
&#8220;The point is to make them realize that there&#8217;s no sense
from a business perspective in counterfeiting our products,
because if we find you, we&#8217;re taking your money away,&#8221; says
John P. Clark, a 55-year-old U.S. law enforcement veteran who
now serves as New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s chief security officer.

Chevron Corp. and OAO Rosneft&#8217;s plan
to drill for oil in the Russian Black Sea hinge on a request for
government tax breaks, according to a copy of their initial
drilling agreement obtained by Bloomberg News. 
The final agreement is conditional on the group gaining
assurances of &#8220;fiscal relief&#8221; from the Russian government &#8220;to
ensure the economic viability of the project,&#8221; according to the
document. The two sides aim to finish negotiations by the end of
March and start drilling at the end of next year. Chevron will
have a 33.3 percent stake in the venture. 
Russia needs foreign capital and technology to tap harder-
to-drill deposits as production from existing fields in Siberia
declines. The deal would mark Chevron&#8217;s second attempt at
Russian offshore drilling after the state annulled a production
sharing agreement to develop a block of the coast of Sakhalin
Island in 2004. 
&#8220;Russia is looking for foreign direct investment in
frontier areas where Russians do not have the expertise to
explore and develop themselves,&#8221; Ed Chow, a senior fellow at
the Center for Strategic International Studies and a former
Chevron executive, said by e-mail. &#8220;There are oil companies
willing to test the investment climate in spite of Russia&#8217;s
dubious track record.&#8221; 
Tax Exemptions 
The state last year approved exemptions from mineral
extraction tax for the first 20 million metric tons of oil
produced from Black Sea deposits. Even so, Chevron Chief
Executive John Watson said the venture would seek tax breaks for
the project in a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
during the signing of the agreement. 
&#8220;Ideally, fiscal relief should come from a change in the
tax laws applying to new exploration and production projects,&#8221;
Alexei Kokin, an oil and gas analyst at AFK Metropol, said by e-
mail today. 
A deal would also mark Chevron&#8217;s initial foray into the
little-explored Black Sea after rival Exxon Mobil Corp. has
snapped up acreage in Turkey and Romania as have Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, OAO Lukoil and Vanco Energy. 
Chevron will provide all financing, up to $1 billion, in
the venture&#8217;s exploration phase which would include drilling two
exploration wells and two appraisal wells on one discovery, the
document said, adding that Chevron will pay a Rosneft bonus in
the event of a discovery. 
Venture Structure 
The group will seek to structure the venture to allow
Chevron to book reserves, according to U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission requirements even though Rosneft will retain complete
ownership of the licenses to the venture&#8217;s West Chernomorsky
block, the agreement said. 
Rosneft has identified 5 potential structures in the
deepwater block and potential resources of 860 million tons of
oil, according to the company website. 
Drilling on the block is expected to begin at the end of
next year, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said last
month at the time of the signing. The two companies will first
have to find a way to close negotiations which have been going
on since at least 2008. 
Both Rosneft and Chevron declined to comment on ongoing
commercial negotiations.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was accused
in a lawsuit by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. of misleading
investors in 2007 when it sold Fannie Mae preferred shares while
betting against the U.S. mortgage market. 
Goldman Sachs misrepresented Fannie Mae&#8217;s health when it
underwrote the offerings, in which the insurer invested
$62.5 million, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Boston. The investment bank misstated the
purpose of the sale by saying the offering was to raise surplus
capital when it was actually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain
its business, said Liberty Mutual, which accused Goldman Sachs
of securities fraud. 
&#8220;As a knowledgeable and sophisticated investor in the U.S.
real estate financial markets, and with access to Fannie Mae&#8217;s
financial records, Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded
the actual status of Fannie Mae&#8217;s capital structure,&#8221; Liberty
Mutual said in the complaint. The mortgage guarantor was seized
by the U.S. in 2008. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the suit was without merit &#8220;and we will contest it
vigorously.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and
regulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage
markets collapsed during the credit crisis. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs in April, claiming it
sold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a
hedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. 
Senate Probe 
At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae
offering, Goldman was aware that there were &#8220;significant
problems&#8221; in the real estate market and bet its own money
against subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual
said in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the
U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
The documents, including internal Goldman Sachs e-mails,
establish that during the time leading up to the disputed
offerings, &#8220;Goldman Sachs not only knew about the serious risks
in the mortgage market, but it was urgently moving to short the
mortgage market,&#8221; the suit says. 
Managing Risk 
The offerings raised almost $8 billion and were completed
in September and December of 2007, according to the complaint.
Fannie Mae fell into U.S. conservatorship the following
September, leaving Liberty&#8217;s investment &#8220;virtually worthless,&#8221;
the suit says. 
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
told the Senate panel in April that his firm is a market-maker,
a role that often puts the company on the opposite side of
customers as it tries to manage its own risk. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
said. 
Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, declined to
comment. The Boston-based company is owned by policyholders and
isn&#8217;t publicly traded. Goldman Sachs advanced $2.26, or
1.7 percent, to $137.72 at 12:05 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock has dropped 18 percent this year. 
Liberty Mutual slashed its stake in Goldman Sachs by
80 percent in the six months ended March 31, 2009. That was part
of more than two years of stock sales that brought the insurer&#8217;s
stake in Goldman Sachs to 7,752 shares at the end of the first
quarter from 46,343 shares in September 2007. 
Liberty Mutual dumped bank stocks after the 2008 financial
crisis, Chief Executive Officer Edmund &#8220;Ted&#8221; Kelly said in a
March 2009 conference call with policyholders and bond
investors. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo
 Co. were among the financial firms sold in late 2008,
according to regulatory filings. 
The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-11150,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second largest mall operator in the U.S., said it has an
agreement for a new $400 million bankruptcy loan from Barclays
Plc. 
General Growth is seeking court permission to use the new
financing to replace its existing $400 million bankruptcy loan,
it said yesterday in papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan. 
The mall owner said it will save $2.7 million per month in
interest payments under the new agreement, &#8220;thereby preserving
value in General Growth that would otherwise be lost,&#8221; if it
didn&#8217;t repay the original loan. 
General Growth, based in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy
last year after amassing a $27 billion debt load making
acquisitions. It has said it expects to file its plan to
restructure its remaining debt this week. 
The new financing comes with a 5.5 percent interest rate
compared with a variable interest rate under the existing loan,
which is currently at 13.5 percent, the lowest rate
possible, General Growth said. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Morgan Stanley and dozens more bank and brokerages were
sued by a Boston area-based fund seeking reimbursement for
losses related to subprime loans. 
Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc., founded by ex-
Goldman Sachs Group bankers Martin Finegold and Robert Kramer,
lost more than $1.2 billion as a result of the banks&#8217; untrue
statements, according to a copy of the complaint filed July 9 in
state court in Massachusetts. 
The banks sold securities backed by mortgages that came
from a &#8220;small group of now notorious subprime mortgage
originators,&#8221; used faulty appraisals, accepted misleading
information in loan applications, and violated their own
standards for underwriting, the firm said in the lawsuit. The
banks offered or sold $2.4 billion of residential mortgage-
backed securities using untrue statements, according to the
lawsuit. 
&#8220;The Wall Street banks conducted inadequate due diligence
and failed to satisfy their own responsibilities,&#8221; Cambridge
Place said in the lawsuit. 
The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. 
&#8216;Improper Lending&#8217; 
The banks created an &#8220;environment of improper lending
practices,&#8221; keeping personnel on site at the mortgage lenders
to monitor the loan underwriting business, according to the
lawsuit. 
The suit also names Bank of America Corp., Merrill Lynch 
Co., UBS AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse
Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC and dozens of
others. 
Representatives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Barclays, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives from the
others couldn&#8217;t be reached after business hours. 
Bank representatives who allegedly offered or sold
securities to Cambridge Place included Scott Eichel, RBS
Securities Inc.&#8217;s co-head of its mortgage and asset backed
securities business, when he had been at Bear Stearns Cos., and
Greg Lippman, who helped create the market for betting against
subprime mortgage bonds in 2005 and then profited along with
hedge funds when home prices declined and defaults soared to
records two years later. 
Eichel, Lippman 
Eichel didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment after regular business hours. A voice message left for
Lippman after business hours wasn&#8217;t returned. 
The filing wasn&#8217;t immediately available on the court&#8217;s
electronic docket and was provided by an attorney for Concord,
Massachusetts-based Cambridge Place Investment Management. 
The case, according to the court records, is Cambridge
Place Investment Management Inc. v. Morgan Stanley, 10-2741,
Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County (Boston).

China&#8217;s first narrow-body jet may
take a technological leap with a contract awarded to a joint
venture between General Electric Co. and state-owned Aviation
Industry Corp. to help design a new way to control the plane. 
The deal announced yesterday with China&#8217;s Commercial
Aircraft Corp. also marks the first foray into the integration
and supply of such control equipment by GE Aviation Systems,
part of the world&#8217;s biggest jet-engine maker, and AVIC. 
GE and AVIC targeted the 150-seat C919 when they unveiled
their 50-50 avionics venture in November. They plan to compete
with suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc., United
Technologies Corp. and Rockwell Collins Inc. by using so-called
open-architecture software that isn&#8217;t tied to one manufacturer. 
&#8220;One of the benefits of this system is that you can
replace dozens of traditional stand-alone computers with less
weight, better reliability, lower complexity,&#8221; said Lorraine Bolsinger, who runs GE Aviation Systems, in a telephone
interview ahead of next week&#8217;s Farnborough Air Show near London. 
Comac, as the Chinese planemaker is known, is promoting the
C919 as a rival to Boeing Co.&#8217;s bestselling 737 and Airbus SAS&#8217;s
A320. The C919 is due to enter service in 2016, and Comac
predicts having 2,300 of the single-aisle planes in operation
over the next two decades. 
For GE, the venture means a chance to take advantage of
Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt&#8217;s $4.8 billion purchase
of Smiths Group Plc&#8217;s aviation unit in 2007. The acquisition
added electronics to the engine business at Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE. 
&#8216;Big Risk&#8217; 
&#8220;Given GE and Smiths&#8217; lack of expertise with a project
like this, it&#8217;s a very big risk, especially for the Chinese,&#8221;
said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Fairfax, Virginia-based
Teal Group. 
GE&#8217;s entry into the avionics market may take business from
suppliers such as Honeywell, Rockwell Collins and Thales SA,
said Michel Merluzeau, an aviation analyst at G2 Solutions in
Kirkland, Washington. 
&#8220;This is a huge deal, perhaps one of those events that has
the potential to redefine the avionics market once every 15 to
20 years,&#8221; Merluzeau said in an e-mail. 
GE Aviation supplies the core computing system on Boeing&#8217;s
787 jumbo jet. In looking for a partner to begin selling open-
source systems, GE Aviation saw AVIC as a &#8220;very natural&#8221;
choice, Bolsinger said. 
Yesterday&#8217;s contract announcement came a week before
planemakers and parts manufacturers gather in Farnborough for
the industry&#8217;s biggest showcase for new products. Many of the
companies are rushing to court business in China as travel
demand rises in the world&#8217;s most-populous country. 
Growth Market 
&#8220;China is the world&#8217;s fastest-growing aviation market and
we need to ensure GE and the United States are part of this
growth,&#8221; John Rice, a GE vice chairman who oversees divisions
including GE Aviation, said in a statement announcing the C919
contract. 
AVIC Vice President Zhang Xinguo said the venture with GE
envisions adding customers in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
The C919, which will join the narrow-body Boeing and Airbus
jets that are the workhorses of airline fleets worldwide, is
already drawing U.S.-based manufacturers. Honeywell said last
week it won a contract valued at more than $3 billion to supply
brakes and other parts for the plane. 
Rockwell Collins said yesterday it signed a letter of
intent to provide communications and navigation systems through
a venture with China Electronics Technology Avionics Co., while
Eaton Corp. and Comac&#8217;s Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. said
they formed a venture for fuel- and hydraulic-system parts. 
GE fell 2 cents to $14.93 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 1.3 percent
this year, compared with a 2 percent decline for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. 
GE said the contract will support jobs in the U.S., China
and the U.K. About $6 billion of GE&#8217;s revenue last year came
from China, Immelt said last week. Sales totaled $157 billion.
Sales in China should rise by at least 10 percent this year,
Immelt reiterated last week.

Stephen Trevor and Stuart Bohart,
the former co-heads of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s asset-management unit,
plan to leave the company seven months after Gregory Fleming was
hired as president of the division. 
Spokeswoman Alyson Barnes confirmed Bohart and Trevor&#8217;s
plans to exit Morgan Stanley Investment Management and declined
to comment further. The Wall Street Journal reported the
departures earlier today. 
The unit had pretax profit of $173 million in the first
quarter, snapping eight quarters of losses on that basis. Morgan
Stanley sold its retail asset-management business, including the
Van Kampen funds, to Invesco Ltd. last month to focus on
institutional funds. 
Bohart, who oversaw the core asset-management business, had
worked at Morgan Stanley since 1997. Trevor joined the firm in
2006 from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to build Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
newly established private-equity business. Both reported to
Fleming, a former Merrill Lynch  Co. executive who was hired by
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman in December. 
Morgan Stanley said in a statement earlier today that it
appointed Michael Kushma chief investment officer for global
fixed-income in the bank&#8217;s asset-management unit. He will
oversee the unit&#8217;s fixed-income strategies, the New York-based
bank said. 
Morgan Stanley also hired Sara Fuber as chief operating
officer of the long-only business, Jim Janover as global head of
risk for the investment-management unit and Lisa Jones as its
global head of sales, according to the statement. The firm also
hired Navtej Nandra to lead Morgan Stanley Investment Management
International.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest

unit. 
Kushma, who joined the firm in 1987, is co-head of the

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
buying five-year Spanish bonds against equivalent-maturity
German securities on &#8220;encouraging policy initiatives,&#8221;
including stress tests for European banks. 
Investors should bet the yield premium investors demand for
the Spanish debt will drop to 150 basis points, Noah Weisberger,
a New York-based trading strategist, wrote in a report received
today. They should end the bet if the spread closes at more than
210 basis points, he said. 
&#8220;The recent policy initiatives have been encouraging,
particularly with respect to the stress tests,&#8221; he said. 
The yield spread widened eight basis points to 209 basis
points as of 12:33 p.m. in London.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia leads
the nation&#8217;s four biggest banks in preparing a &#8220;deluge&#8221; of
bond sales as they seek to refinance notes and fund lending,
driving up costs for the most indebted, Morgan Stanley said. 
Commonwealth Bank, Westpac Banking Corp., National
Australia Bank Ltd. and Australia  New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. need to borrow about A$140 billion ($122 billion) in the
year to Sept. 30 and A$162 billion in the following 12 months,
Morgan Stanley strategists led by Pieter Van Der Schaft wrote in
a note e-mailed today. 
Investors will &#8220;increasingly differentiate between banks
on the basis of funding requirements,&#8221; the strategists said.
Most sales will have to be done &#8220;at a higher cost offshore due
to limited onshore absorption capacity of new bank issuance.&#8221; 
Australia&#8217;s top four banks, facing tougher capital rules
requiring them to hold more liquid assets and less of each
others&#8217; debt, are seeking funds offshore in an effort to cut
borrowing costs. The extra yield investors demand to hold
Australian financial company debt instead of government bonds
has jumped 22 basis points since the start of June, a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index shows. 
Westpac, Australia&#8217;s second-biggest bank by market value,
raised A$800 million from five-year bonds on June 29, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The notes, priced to yield 135 basis points more than the
bank bill swap-rate, caused spreads on comparable four- and six-
year Australian dollar-denominated bank bonds to widen by 15
basis points, Morgan Stanley said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.

Pfizer Inc. directors should be held
liable for the drugmaker&#8217;s repeated violations of federal laws
governing drug-marketing practices that resulted in the company
having to pay a $2.3 billion settlement, a union pension fund
said in a lawsuit. 
New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s board turned a blind eye to
criminal guilty pleas the company entered over marketing
practices for medicines such its Bextra pain-killing drug and
its Neurontin epilepsy pill, the Bricklayers Local 8  Plasters
Local 233 Pension Fund, a Pfizer shareholder, said in the suit.
Directors&#8217; inaction has hurt the value of investors&#8217; stakes in
the company, the fund&#8217;s lawyers contend. 
&#8220;The board and senior management made a calculated bet
that the negative consequences of getting caught would never
become significant,&#8221; the fund&#8217;s attorneys said today in the
Delaware Chancery Court complaint. &#8220;Defendants lost that bet.&#8221; 
The $2.3 billion settlement to resolve government probes
into Pfizer&#8217;s marketing practices was the largest accord in
history to address such sales techniques. Proceeds from the
accord went to government health agencies including Medicare,
Medicaid and the military&#8217;s Tricare health plan. 
Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, didn&#8217;t return calls and
an e-mail for comment on the suit. Pfizer is the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker. 
&#8216;Red Flags&#8217; 
Pfizer has paid at least $2.7 billion to settle claims over
its marketing practices pressed by government regulators or by
consumers suing over its products, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. 
In addition to the $2.3 billion it paid over Bextra and
other drugs, the company paid $430 million to resolve
prosecutors&#8217; claims that it illegally marketed Neurontin. 
&#8220;The fact that Pfizer has been operated with a systematic
disregard for the laws governing its fundamental business was
not hidden from the board, which repeatedly and knowingly
disregarded red flags that clearly demonstrated the company&#8217;s
wrongdoing,&#8221; the fund&#8217;s lawyers said in the suit. 
The fund wants directors held liable for the company&#8217;s
improper acts and seek to recoup &#8220;all profits, benefits and
other compensation&#8221; they reaped as board members. 
The case is Bricklayers Local v. Ausiello and Pfizer Inc.,
CA5631, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Alastair Maxwell, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of energy investment
banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, to join the firm
in London, said a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Maxwell will join Goldman in October, said the person who
declined to be identified because the appointment hasn&#8217;t been
made public. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and a
spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
At Morgan Stanley, Maxwell&#8217;s group worked with the
government of Ghana on offshore oil and gas deposits, advising
it when Kosmos Energy LLC tried last year to sell a stake in the
$3.1 billion Jubilee oil field to Exxon Mobil Corp. Goldman&#8217;s
energy clients include London-based BP Plc, which plans to raise
$10 billion selling assets as it tries to contain the worst oil
spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The oil and gas industry is the second-biggest mergers and
acquisitions market by volume this year, with $78 billion of
announced transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
BP&#8217;s $7 billion purchase of Devon Energy Corp. assets in Brazil,
Azerbaijan and the Gulf of Mexico was the biggest takeover, the
data show. 
BP is in talks to sell a stake in Alaskan assets to Apache
Corp. of the U.S. which may be worth $12 billion, people
familiar with the matter said July 11.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, filed a reorganization plan
saying it will split itself into two companies when it exits
bankruptcy in October. 
Under the proposal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York,
General Growth will fully repay debt and other claims, raise as
much as $8.5 billion of new capital and issue stock in two new
companies to current shareholders. 
Today&#8217;s filing marks the start of the last stage of General
Growth&#8217;s bankruptcy case, which began after the company failed
to refinance its debt during the credit crunch. At the time,
commercial real estate prices in the U.S. had dropped 15 percent
and retail sales had fallen as job losses forced consumers to
pull back. 
&#8220;Things went from bleak to full payment,&#8221; said Kirk Ruddy, senior vice president of trading at APS Capital Corp. and
a former Bear Stearns Cos. claims trader. 
The company&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy is being funded by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LLC, General Growth
said today in a statement. 
The company has already won court approval to restructure
$15 billion of secured debt tied to 144 properties. 
General Growth in May received court approval to move
forward with financing commitments from the companies after
rejecting a competing bid from Simon Property Group Inc., the
largest mall owner. 
180 Properties 
It expects to emerge from reorganization in October and
remain the second-largest mall owner in the U.S., with 180
properties in 43 states. 
General Growth began the largest real-estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. 
The two new General Growth companies will divide the
assets, with the larger one keeping the name and most of the
malls and receiving at least $6.3 billion of the new investment,
according to the statement. 
The smaller company will get mixed-use residential
properties and $250 million through a rights offering, said
David Keating, a spokesman. 
The Chicago-based company filed for bankruptcy after
amassing a $27 billion debt load while making acquisitions.
Since the filing, it has restructured $15 billion worth of its
project-level debt. 
The Teacher Retirement System of Texas agreed yesterday to
invest $500 million in the company. 
The filing of the plan &#8220;is an important milestone in our
restructuring process,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Adam Metz said
in the statement. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

National Bank of Canada, the
country&#8217;s sixth-biggest bank, was cited among five &#8220;defensive&#8221;
financial stocks by Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;We would recommend National Bank as the most defensive
within the Canadian banks, the strongest asset quality and also
the most insulation to potential weakness in the U.S. and the
broader global economy,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analyst Cheryl Pate
said on a conference call today. 
Morgan Stanley also recommended Chubb Corp., MetLife Inc.,
People&#8217;s United Financial Inc. and Travelers Cos. for a
&#8220;defensive portfolio&#8221; in case the U.S. economy is weaker than
expected. Montreal-based National Bank was highlighted because
it has &#8220;very little&#8221; international exposure, earning 65
percent of revenue from the province of Quebec. 
National Bank may also raise its dividend one quarter
before Canada&#8217;s other banks, Pate said in the webcast call. 
&#8220;We believe the next catalyst for National is going to be
a dividend increase,&#8221; Pate said. &#8220;We think National&#8217;s going to
be the first of the Canadian banks to raise the dividend, and
we&#8217;re expecting this in the fourth quarter of this year.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley named Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
 Co., Prudential Financial Inc., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
and Zions Bancorporation for its top five picks for financial
stocks in a July 12 note, given a slowly improving credit and
regulatory environment.

Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s second-
biggest merger adviser, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Thomas M. Miles, who helped arrange takeovers for companies such as UAL
Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
Miles, a managing director in JPMorgan&#8217;s MA group, will
take a similar role at Morgan Stanley when he joins later this
year, Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake confirmed. Miles worked
at JPMorgan since 1994. 
Miles was part of the JPMorgan team that helped Chicago-
based UAL win an agreement in May to merge with Continental
Airlines Inc., creating the world&#8217;s largest airline. JPMorgan
stands to earn a $23 million fee for the assignment. Last year,
he advised Bristol-Myers, the New York drugmaker, on its $2.4
billion acquisition of Medarex Inc. 
Morgan Stanley has been adding investment bankers from
competitors this year, hiring energy bankers Michael Johnson,
Jonathan Cox, and Eduardo Miras from Deutsche Bank AG and
Citigroup Inc. financial-services specialist Gary Shedlin.
Outside of the investment bank, it&#8217;s hired 100 bankers to offer
loan products to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney clients, and may
quintuple that number by 2011, according to a person with
knowledge of the strategy. 
Morgan Stanley is the second-biggest adviser on mergers
announced globally this year, behind Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan are ranked third and fourth.

Microsoft Corp. is paying developers
to build mobile applications for its Windows Phone 7 system to
help it narrow a lead by rival products from Apple Inc. and
Google Inc. 
The company is providing financial incentives ranging from
free tools and test handsets to funds for software development
and marketing, said Todd Brix, a senior director at Microsoft
who works with app developers. In some cases, Microsoft is
providing revenue guarantees, and will make up the difference if
apps don&#8217;t sell as well as expected, he said. 
Microsoft revamped its flagship mobile operating system to
recoup market share lost to Google and Apple. To win consumers,
the world&#8217;s largest software maker needs an ample supply of
games, music and navigation apps when handsets with Windows
Phone 7 reach stores later this year. Some developers may be
reluctant to sign up before they know Windows Phone will lure
enough customers, said Kevin Burden, an analyst at ABI Research. 
&#8220;In no way do they want to say, &#8216;Trust us, there will be
apps at some point,&#8217;&#8221; said Burden, who is based in Hopkinton,
Massachusetts. &#8220;If that means paying developers, so be it. It&#8217;s
a good strategy for them.&#8221; 
While Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has used
similar compensation programs for previous versions of its
mobile operating system, it&#8217;s devoting a larger sum this time,
Brix said. He declined to say how much Microsoft will spend. 
&#8216;Open for Business&#8217; 
&#8220;We are investing a lot to attract developers big and small
to Windows Phone 7 to let them understand what the opportunity
is and provide as many resources as we can to help them be
successful on our platform,&#8221; Brix said. &#8220;We&#8217;re open for business
and we want to work with them.&#8221; 
Microsoft needs a hit to turn around its mobile business,
which Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said this week
&#8220;missed a generation.&#8221; 
Windows accounted for 6.9 percent of the worldwide
smartphone-software market in the first quarter, from 10.8
percent a year earlier, according ABI. Shipments of the iPhone
rose to 15.8 percent, while Android handsets had 9.9 percent. 
At least four app makers have been approached by Microsoft
and offered financial incentives in cash, assistance with
development costs or revenue guarantees in exchange for having
apps ready at or near the release of Windows Phone 7, said five
people with knowledge of the matter. The people declined to be
named because the incentive terms are confidential. 
Fewer Apps Than Apple 
Other mobile software makers use different approaches to
entice programmers. Apple shares a portion of the revenue
generated when consumers buy apps from its online store. With
more than 51 million iPhones sold since its 2007 debut,
Cupertino, California-based Apple hasn&#8217;t offered payments like
Microsoft&#8217;s incentives to gain programs, the people said. 
Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. 
Apple has about 225,000 apps available for the iPhone,
while devices that run on Google&#8217;s Android operating system have
access to some 65,000. 
Microsoft is starting from scratch in amassing apps for
Windows Phone 7. Its overhaul of the operating system was so
complete that programs developed for older Windows-based phones
won&#8217;t work on the new one. At the end of last year, Microsoft
had only 246 apps, according to ABI. 
Microsoft rose 31 cents to $25.44 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 17 percent
this year. 
The company&#8217;s deep pockets and the likelihood it will keep
investing in Windows Phone 7 mean Microsoft may have an easier
time luring developers than a smaller company, Burden said. 
&#8216;Unproven Prospect&#8217; 
Developers expect Windows Phone 7 to be successful, three
of the people said. Yet it&#8217;s difficult to get companies to build
software for an operating system that doesn&#8217;t exist yet. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely less enthusiasm today for Windows Phone
7 -- developers develop for the platform with largest number of
users because that&#8217;s where they can make the most money,&#8221; said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland,
Washington. &#8220;Windows Phone 7 is an unproven prospect. It
definitely makes sense for Microsoft to prime the pump a little
bit.&#8221; 
Last month, Microsoft scrapped an effort to sell its own
phone, less than two months after the device debuted. Sales of
the Kin social-networking phones fell short of the company&#8217;s
expectations, a person familiar with the matter said then.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, named Jeff Urwin and Kevin Willsey as co-heads of investment banking for the U.S. and
Canada. 
The pair succeed Doug Braunstein, who was named chief
financial officer of the bank in June, according to an internal
memo dated today from Jes Staley, chief executive officer of the
investment-banking unit at New York-based JPMorgan Chase. 
Staley said investment bank co-chair Jimmy Lee will
&#8220;continue to serve as our senior dealmaker and manage many of
our top client relationships.&#8221; He&#8217;ll also be an adviser to
Urwin and Willsey, Staley said. 
Urwin, 54, joined the firm when it acquired Bear Stearns
Cos. in 2008 and Willsey, 47, was previously JPMorgan&#8217;s chairman
of global equity capital and derivative markets. Willsey, who
started at JPMorgan in 1989, rejoined the bank in 2002 after a
two-year stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;Both Jeff and Kevin are outstanding individuals with
impeccable character and a drive to serve clients,&#8221; Staley told
employees in the memo, which was confirmed by spokeswoman Tasha Pelio. Staley said the two will manage the business jointly,
focusing on their own areas of expertise. 
Urwin was JPMorgan&#8217;s head of investment banking coverage of
the Americas. He previously was co-head of investment banking at
Bear Stearns, which he joined in 1996, and head of global
emerging markets at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York. 
Visa, Wells Fargo Deals 
Willsey has raised capital for clients in the U.S., Europe,
Asia and Latin America, according to JPMorgan. He has managed
major financing deals, including Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion
initial public offering, Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s $12.6 billion
equity offering used to acquire Wachovia Corp. and JPMorgan&#8217;s
own $11.5 billion equity deal to acquire assets of Washington
Mutual Inc., the company said. 
Lee, 57, advised UAL Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines on its $3.1
billion merger with Continental Airlines Inc. earlier this year.
He also helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury Department on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt
holders.

Microsoft Corp. said the 12th
alleged member of a Russian spy ring operating in the U.S. was
an employee at the company&#8217;s Redmond, Washington, headquarters. 
The man, a Russian citizen in his early 20s named Alexey
Karetnikov, worked for Microsoft as a software tester for about
nine months, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Moscow, who declined
to be identified in line with company rules, said by e-mail
today. 
Russia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the news
when contacted by Bloomberg. 
Ten members of the spy ring pleaded guilty to conspiring to
serve as unregistered foreign agents on June 8 in a U.S. federal
court in Manhattan. They admitted to carrying money or coded
messages, secretly communicating with Russian officials and
instructing others on how to find information useful to Russia.
Their objective was to infiltrate U.S. policy-making circles
after constructing false American identities, prosecutors said. 
Karetnikov was deported on charges of violating U.S.
immigration laws, Itar-Tass reported, citing Matt Chandler, a
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Karetnikov admitted to the violation and agreed to deportation
to avoid court proceedings, the state-run news service said. 
Software Company 
The Facebook page of a person identified as Alexey
Karetnikov shows that he is married and graduated from St.
Petersburg State Polytechnic University in 2009. He worked for a
company called &#8220;Neobit&#8221; in addition to Microsoft, according to
the Facebook page. 
A St. Petersburg-based software developer called OOO NeoBIT
lists Katernikov&#8217;s university among its partners and the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB,
among its clients, according to the company&#8217;s website. 
No one at NeoBIT&#8217;s offices answered repeated calls from
Bloomberg News. 
Strategic Forecasting Inc. said yesterday another member of
the ring tried to get the risk advisory group to install
software he said his company had developed. 
Assumed Names 
A man calling himself Donald Heathfield held five meetings
with an employee of Austin, Texas-based Stratfor in an effort to
get the firm to use his program, Chief Executive Officer George Friedman said in an e-mailed report. Heathfield, who later
identified himself as Andrey Bezrukov, was one of 10 people U.S.
authorities traded for four Russians on July 9 in Vienna. 
&#8220;We suspect that had this been done, our servers would be
outputting to Moscow,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;We did not know at the
time who he was. We have since reported the incident to the
FBI.&#8221; 
Bezrukov and his partner in the network were sentenced to
time served and deported after agreeing to give up their home on
Trowbridge Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and all the funds
in four bank accounts. Bezrukov&#8217;s partner, who was identified as
Tracey Foley at the time of her arrest, told the court her real
name was Elena Vavilova. 
Bezrukov, Vavilova and the other members of the spy ring
are being debriefed at the Foreign Intelligence Service&#8217;s
compound in southern Moscow, Moskovsky Komsomolets, Russia&#8217;s
second-biggest newspaper by circulation, reported yesterday,
citing unidentified Russian security officials. That process may
last weeks, the Moscow-based daily said. 
Some of the 10 agents may continue to work with the
security service, while others will be free to pursue new
careers, Moskovsky Komsomolets said.

Kathy Matsui, an investment
strategist in Japan for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., cut her three-
month estimate for the Topix index by 5.3 percent, citing
political uncertainties and the yen&#8217;s appreciation. 
Matsui lowered the target to 900 from 950, according to a
report dated yesterday, when the gauge closed at 854.39. The
strategist cut her six-month estimate to 950 from 1,000 and the
12-month prediction to 1,020 from 1,150, the report said. 
The Topix fell 0.8 percent in the previous two days after
the ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost control of the upper
house in a weekend election. The yen climbed a week ago to near
its highest level in seven months as concerns over the health of
the global economy caused some investors to seek refuge in
Japan&#8217;s currency. A stronger yen hurts the value of export
revenue that is repatriated. 
&#8220;In the short term, political uncertainties will likely
mount and the policymaking processes may become more
cumbersome,&#8221; Matsui wrote in the Japanese-language report.
&#8220;The most powerful driver for an increase in investment in
Japanese stocks is the yen&#8217;s depreciation.&#8221; 
The strategist raised her rating on communication and
transportation companies to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221;
citing large cash flows and the possibility of China relaxing
tightening policies. She also recommends retail and real-estate
companies that should be supported by economic measures such as
child-care allowances and tax breaks for home buyers. 
Matsui lowered her call on the precision-machinery and
consumer-electronics industries to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight,&#8221; because a slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt
profits of companies that rely on overseas sales.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused by
the U.S. government of defrauding investors, is generating
better returns for companies and buyers of initial public
offerings than any other Wall Street firm. 
American companies that used New York-based Goldman Sachs
as the lead underwriter for initial sales got the highest prices
for their shares in the first half of 2010, selling at an
average 1.4 percent discount to their offering range, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Buyers were rewarded with an average
first-day advance of 9.6 percent, the biggest this year. 
The U.S. IPO market is proving why Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street&#8217;s history, is still
the bank of choice for companies looking to raise capital and
buyers seeking the biggest returns, finance professors at the
University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame said.
Offerings led by Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
were discounted the most and produced the smallest gains,
Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;The issuer and investor care about the opposite things,
and the investment bank is in the middle,&#8221; said Steven Kaplan,
professor of finance at the University of Chicago&#8217;s Booth School
of Business. &#8220;There&#8217;s conflict. Goldman appears to have done
very well.&#8221; 
SEC Charges 
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s firm is beating
competitors in an area that generates some of Wall Street&#8217;s
biggest fees. Bankers charged 6.4 percent for underwriting U.S.
IPOs this year, more than 10 times that for mergers and
acquisitions and corporate bonds, Bloomberg data show. 
Goldman Sachs won the largest share of the $580 million in
fees from initial offerings in the first half, even after the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm in April for
allegedly selling mortgage-related securities that were designed
to fail. The bank has called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; 
SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs was the so-called lead-left underwriter for
11 U.S. IPOs in the first half, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
More than half of those were priced above the middle of the
offering range, while Goldman Sachs-led deals accounted for four
of this year&#8217;s five biggest premiums, the data indicate. 
Companies that didn&#8217;t hire the 141-year old firm to lead
their IPOs took an average discount of 14 percent for their
shares. 
First-Day Gains 
Buying initial sales from Goldman Sachs has produced first-
day gains that are more than double the average 3.6 percent for
offerings arranged by other banks, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In the first month of trading, IPOs led by Morgan Stanley
produced the largest returns, rising 7.8 percent on average. 
 Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
 Financial Engines Inc., the investment adviser co-founded
by Nobel laureate William Sharpe, garnered the largest premium
of any U.S. IPO this year in a March deal led by Goldman Sachs. 
The provider of portfolio-management services to people
with employer-sponsored retirement plans jumped 44 percent in
its first day, the biggest surge this year, after selling shares
at $12 each. The price was 20 percent higher than the Palo Alto,
California-based company had originally asked buyers to pay. 
&#8220;Goldman is clearly the king investment banker,&#8221; said Tim Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame&#8217;s
Mendoza College of Business in Notre Dame, Indiana. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
come under fire, but it doesn&#8217;t matter. If you&#8217;re an issuing
firm, that&#8217;s the first firm you would go to.&#8221; 
Tesla Motors 
While the first-day performance of initial sales led by
Goldman Sachs helped buyers reap immediate profits, investors
that held onto the shares have seen the gains diminish. The
advance for the 11 IPOs shrank to 2.5 percent on average over
the first month of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
 Tesla Motors Inc., the Palo Alto-based maker of the
electric Roadster, erased almost all its 41 percent first-day
surge in the next nine days after the first IPO by an American
car company since 1956. 
The automaker run by Elon Musk raised $260 million selling
shares for $17 each, 13 percent higher than the midpoint of its
forecast price range and the third-largest premium for a U.S.
company this year. Tesla&#8217;s stock ended at $18.14 yesterday, 24
percent below its first-day close of $23.89. 
&#8216;The Credibility&#8217; 
&#8220;For the underwriter, first-day success is a very
important measure in terms of certifying the power and the
credibility of the franchise,&#8221; said Josef Schuster, the
Chicago-based founder of IPOX Capital Management LLC, which
oversees $3 billion. &#8220;A good first-day pop certifies the
quality job the underwriter has done with investors and the
company in order to further deals.&#8221; 
Schuster, who purchased Tesla shares for his Direxion
Long/Short Global IPO Fund, sold 30 percent of his stake on the
second day of trading as the stock rose as much as 79 percent
from its offering price. 
Some deals arranged by Goldman Sachs have helped private
equity sellers while leaving IPO buyers with losses. 
The initial offering of Metals USA Holdings Corp., a Fort
Lauderdale, Florida-based metals processor, almost quadrupled
the value for Leon Black&#8217;s New York-based leveraged-buyout firm
Apollo Global Management LLC&#8217;s investment. The shares lost 8.6
percent on the first day and 28 percent after one month. 
Besides Financial Engines and Tesla, four other IPOs led by
Goldman Sachs -- Calix Inc. of Petaluma, California, Chicago-
based Accretive Health Inc. and CBOE Holdings Inc., and Higher
One Holdings Inc. in New Haven, Connecticut -- climbed at least
12 percent in their first day of trading. 
Morgan Stanley 
Morgan Stanley, which led IPOs that had an average 7.5
percent first-day gain, completed every deal that it
participated in after marketing began, according to Paul Donahue, the firm&#8217;s co-head of U.S. equity capital markets. 
Every other bank had at least one deal that was scuttled,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Americold Realty Trust, the
Atlanta-based warehouse operator owned by Ron Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa
Cos., postponed what would have been the largest IPO of 2010 in
May after cutting its midpoint price by 33 percent. Goldman
Sachs was hired to lead the IPO. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say that everyone entered 2010 with great
expectations and the market has proven to be trickier than
people would have thought entering the year,&#8221; said Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Donahue. &#8220;It&#8217;s exactly these types of markets where
we think Morgan Stanley as a franchise has differentiated
itself.&#8221; 
Credit Suisse, JPMorgan 
All five U.S. companies that listed Credit Suisse as the
first underwriter took price cuts. The average 21 percent
discount from the original midpoint offer price was the biggest
for any firm&#8217;s deals. 
Sales arranged by Zurich-based Credit Suisse, Switzerland&#8217;s
second-biggest bank, also left investors with the smallest
first-day returns as four of the five companies rose less than 1
percent. The gains then turned into declines that averaged 7.8
percent in the first month, making it the only bank whose deals
lost money for IPO buyers in the period, Bloomberg data show. 
 Alimera Sciences Inc., the Alpharetta, Georgia-based
developer of treatments for diseases of the retina, sold its
shares for $11 each after cutting the range from $15 to $17 in
an offering led by Credit Suisse. The stock closed unchanged in
its first day of trading before falling 27 percent in the next
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 Duncan King, a Credit Suisse spokesman, declined to
comment. 
Winning Deals 
&#8220;Pricing above or below the range generally reflects
strong or weak demand relative to what was originally
expected,&#8221; said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the
University of Florida in Gainesville who has studied IPOs for
three decades. &#8220;If an underwriter is consistently pricing below
the range, however, it might mean that it had been aggressive in
suggesting a high valuation in order to win deals.&#8221; 
Six of the eight companies that hired New York-based
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, to lead their IPOs sold
shares at a discount. The average price reduction equaled 20.9
percent, the data show. 
 AVEO Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing a kidney-
cancer treatment, took the biggest cut, reducing its price by 36
percent. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company sold shares
at $9 each after offering them at $13 to $15. 
The initial sales by JPMorgan produced first-day gains of
3.5 percent, less than every bank except for Credit Suisse.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a balancing act,&#8221; said Lisa Jacobs, a New York-
based partner in the capital markets group at law firm Shearman
 Sterling LLP. &#8220;Lead underwriters are looking for that price
at which both the companies and investors get the benefit of the
bargain and feel they&#8217;ve gotten a good deal. It&#8217;s a fair amount
of science but it&#8217;s also a little bit of art.&#8221;

Chevron Corp., the oil producer
fighting lawsuits over environmental damage from drilling in
Ecuador, won a request to see outtakes from &#8220;Crude: The Real
Price of Oil,&#8221; a film about oil exploration in the country. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York today ordered
filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to turn over footage not included in
the publicly released version of the movie. Appearing in the so-
called outtakes are lawyers for the plaintiffs in a lawsuit
against Chevron, private and court-appointed experts in the
suit, and current and former Ecuadorian officials. 
&#8220;We have already seen instances of collusion and fraud on
the part of plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers in portions of Crude that have
been publicly released,&#8221; Justin Higgs, a spokesman for Chevron
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are confident that review of
the outtakes will reveal additional instances of misconduct.&#8221; 
Chevron won a lower court ruling in May ordering Berlinger
to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the San Ramon,
California-based company&#8217;s operations in Ecuador. The company
argued that footage shot for the film may be relevant in a
lawsuit brought by Ecuadoreans, in Chevron&#8217;s arbitration against
Ecuador, and in criminal proceedings in the South American
country. 
The lower-court judge postponed a Chevron subpoena
requiring Berlinger to surrender his outtakes to allow him to
appeal the ruling. Berlinger&#8217;s lawyer, Maura Wogan, had argued
that rulings against her client will compromise the rights of
other documentary makers protecting their unpublished material. 
Wogan didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment
today. 
The district court case is In re Application of Chevron
Corp., M-19-111, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The appeals court case is Chevron v.
Berlinger, 10-1918, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
Court (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle
U.S. regulatory claims it misled investors in collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. 
The penalty is the largest ever levied by the Securities
and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said in a statement announcing the accord today. Under the deal,
Goldman Sachs acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that
marketing materials for the instruments had &#8220;incomplete
information,&#8221; the agency said. 
For Goldman Sachs, the payment amounts to 14 days of
earnings, based on first-quarter results. It&#8217;s the equivalent
of 93 cents a share, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
Bernstein  Co., who had estimated a cost of $1.05. 
&#8220;This appears to be negligence, not fraud,&#8221; Hintz said in
an e-mail, citing the SEC&#8217;s use of words such as &#8220;mistake&#8221; and
&#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &#8220;Bottom line the SEC and the
administration gets a headline and a &#8216;political win&#8217; and GS gets
an &#8216;economic win.&#8217;&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade
and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
&#8216;It Was a Mistake&#8217; 
&#8220;It was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to
state that the reference portfolio was &#8216;selected by&#8217; ACA
Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson  Co. Inc.
in the portfolio selection process,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s statement quoted
Goldman Sachs as saying in settlement documents. 
The bank, based in New York, didn&#8217;t admit or deny
wrongdoing under the accord, the SEC said. The payment includes
a $300 million fine and $250 million as restitution to
investors. IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, the first German
lender bailed out during the subprime crisis, will receive $150
million, and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will get $100 million,
the SEC said. 
Shares of Goldman Sachs, which closed today at $145.22,
dropped 21 percent since April 15, the day before the suit was
filed, and jumped 4.4 percent today after the SEC said it
planned a &#8220;significant announcement.&#8221; The SP 500 Financial
Index declined 13 percent since the SEC filed suit. 
&#8220;This takes a cloud off the stock,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages $13.3 billion including
Goldman Sachs shares. For Goldman Sachs, the settlement means
&#8220;we&#8217;re done, turn the spotlight off, we&#8217;re out of here,&#8221; he
said. 
Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s Case 
Sorrentino said his firm may still reduce its holdings in
Goldman Sachs on any price gains because he&#8217;s concerned about
the effect of financial regulatory legislation passed today by
the Senate. Goldman Sachs said the agency doesn&#8217;t &#8216;&#8216;anticipate&#8217;&#8217;
it will bring more claims linked to collateralized debt
obligations. 
Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs worker targeted by
the SEC, remains an employee of the firm and is on leave, said
Lucas van Praag, a company spokesman. The firm promised to
cooperate with the SEC in the case against Tourre and other
&#8220;ongoing litigation,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s deputy enforcement
director, Lorin Reisner, told reporters in Washington. 
SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami called the
settlement &#8220;a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product
is too complex, and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a
heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of
honest treatment and fair dealing.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable securities firm, climbed more than 4
percent amid speculation it will settle U.S. claims that it
defrauded investors. CNBC reported after the market closed that
the firm reached a settlement. 
Goldman Sachs jumped in New York trading after the
Securities and Exchange Commission said it would make a
&#8220;significant announcement&#8221; at a 4:45 p.m. news conference. 
The New York Times reported that the firm will pay $550
million to settle the claims, without admitting wrongdoing. Of
that, Goldman Sachs will pay $300 million in fines and the rest
will be restitution. 
&#8220;If and when a settlement is reached, the pool of
potential investors in Goldman stock will get expanded,&#8221;
Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in New
York, wrote in a note to investors today. &#8220;Many that we have
spoken with are prohibited from owning Goldman stock when there
is a threat of criminal action.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs created and sold collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped picked the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade

Goldman Sachs has said the allegations were unfounded. 
The firm&#8217;s stock, which closed today at $145.22, has
dropped 21 percent since April 15, the close before the suit was
filed. The SP 500 Financial Index declined 13 percent in the
same period. 
Mayo, who predicted last month that a settlement could be
reached as early as July 20, has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Goldman
Sachs shares with a target stock price of $207.

Credit-default swaps protecting
against losses on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bonds fell after a
report the bank reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.                              
Five-year contracts on New York-based Goldman declined
about 4 basis points to a mid-price of 167 basis points,
according to data provider CMA. The contracts had been trading
at 177 basis points before CNBC reported the bank had reached a
settlement over fraud allegations, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said profit rose 76 percent, buoyed
by a $6.3 billion reduction in provisions for soured mortgages
and credit-card loans from last year. 
Second-quarter net income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09
a share, even as revenue fell 7.6 percent, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. The bank earned $2.72
billion, or 28 cents, in the same period a year earlier and
$3.33 billion in the first quarter. 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, said he isn&#8217;t
satisfied with the results, even though they surpassed the most
optimistic analyst&#8217;s estimate, because consumer lending charge-
offs and late payments remain high. A 7.6 percent decline in
revenue prompted Shannon Stemm, an analyst for Edward Jones 
Co. in St. Louis, to question whether the profit report masked
weakness in JPMorgan&#8217;s main businesses. 
&#8220;The results beat estimates by so much because of the
large reserve release,&#8221; Stemm said. &#8220;Revenue fell quarter over
quarter and year over year, largely driven by weaker investment-
banking and fixed-income trading results, which were down
because of the volatile trading environment.&#8221; 
JPMorgan rose 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $40.46 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m. The
stock lost 3.2 percent this year through yesterday.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, won dismissal of a lawsuit by a
victim of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, claiming the bank
knowingly participated in the fraud. 
U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in New York threw out
the suit filed by MLSMK Investments Co., which said the New
York-based bank in September 2008 investigated Madoff,
determined he was a fraud and liquidated its $250 million
investment in a Madoff-linked fund. 
&#8220;While it might have been possible for defendants to
determine that Madoff was committing fraud from the &#8216;red flags&#8217;
that plaintiff points out, plaintiff alleges no facts to
demonstrate that defendants actually did make such a
discovery,&#8221; Jones wrote in an opinion released today. 
MLSMK, a Palm Beach, Florida, partnership, claimed it lost
$12.8 million to Madoff from October to December 2008, the month
he was arrested and charged in history&#8217;s biggest Ponzi scheme.
The case alleged civil racketeering, negligence and bad faith. 
&#8220;We thought we laid out enough of a factual basis, at the
pleading stage, to show that Chase knew at least by September
2008 that Madoff was committing fraud, but continued providing
services that enabled him to continue the fraud,&#8221; said Howard Kleinhendler, a lawyer for MLSMK. 
Kleinhendler said his client is considering an appeal. 
Stolen Money 
The suit, filed in April 2009, claimed MLSMK deposited the
$12.8 million in Madoff&#8217;s Chase account, expecting that the
money would be used to buy and sell securities for its benefit.
Madoff never invested the money and instead stole it. 
MLSMK claimed that in 2008, when most investors in stocks
were losing money, JPMorgan became suspicious of Madoff&#8217;s
consistently high returns. JPMorgan employees met with Madoff
and did their own investigation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Services LLC, MLSMK said. 
JPMorgan &#8220;unequivocally concluded that Madoff&#8217;s reported
returns were false and illegitimate&#8221; and &#8220;quietly liquidated&#8221;
its $250 million position in a Madoff-linked fund, MLSMK said.
JPMorgan then decided to &#8220;partner with him in the fleecing of
his victims,&#8221; the firm claimed. 
JPMorgan helped Madoff perpetuate his fraud by continuing
to provide banking services and trade with Madoff&#8217;s market-
making business after learning of the fraud, MLSMK claimed. 
Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to fraud and other crimes on
March 12, 2009, and is serving a 150-year prison term. 
The case is: MLSMK Investments Co. v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
09-CV-4049, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. should return
more capital to investors after buying back $500 million in
shares, according to Charles Peabody, a partner and research
analyst at Portales Partners LLC. 
&#8220;If they have this fortress-type balance sheet with excess
capital and excess loan loss reserves, they should start
returning that to shareholders in various forms,&#8221; Peabody said
today during a radio interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Surveillance. 
The bank bought back $135 million of the shares through the
end of the second quarter and the rest this month, Michael Cavanagh, the New York-based company&#8217;s chief executive officer
for Treasury and security services, told journalists on a
conference call today. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a start,&#8221; said Peabody, who recommended JPMorgan
buy back more shares or pursue an acquisition. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, said it had $108.2
billion, or 9.6 percent of assets, in Tier 1 regulatory capital,
a core measure of solvency demanded by regulators that includes
common stock and disclosed reserves. 
Quarterly net income increased 76 percent to $4.8 billion,
or $1.09 a share, beating an average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts for adjusted earnings of 71 cents. Profit
grew even as revenue fell 7.6 percent. 
U.S. banks have been hesitant to return capital to
shareholders following the worst economic crisis since the Great
Depression. 
Dimon on Dividends 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today in a
conference call that his preference is to buy back stock rather
than raise the dividend. He said last month that it may be &#8220;too
ambitious&#8221; to expect a dividend increase by the year-end. 
Pushing a dividend increase back until 2011 is &#8220;probably
too long a time to wait,&#8221; Peabody said. 
JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the first-
and third-largest U.S. lenders, respectively, may report
earnings of $2.6 billion and $1.46 billion when they release
results tomorrow, Bloomberg surveys show.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to sell 10-year global notes
as soon as today after reporting profit rose 76 percent, more
than analysts estimated. 
The sale will be benchmark in size, according to a person
familiar with the transaction, who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t set. A benchmark sale is typically at least
$500 million. 
JPMorgan is marketing debt after it said second-quarter net
income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, from $2.72
billion, or 28 cents, in the same period a year earlier. The
per-share earnings compared with an average estimate for
adjusted earnings of 71 cents projected by 22 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s probably some appetite, or as good of appetite as
there&#8217;s been for financials to potentially come to market,&#8221; Tom Murphy, who helps oversee more than $20 billion of investment-
grade credit at Columbus Management in Minneapolis, said in a
telephone interview earlier this week. &#8220;It will be something
very interesting to follow to see if the JPMorgans, the Bank of
Americas, et cetera, decide to do some term-issuance at much
tighter spreads, at much tighter yields.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank ranked by
assets, is expected to report earnings tomorrow. 
Last Sale 
JPMorgan last sold debt on June 17, issuing $1.25 billion
of five-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
3.4 percent notes priced to yield 3.445 percent, or 145 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. That offering was boosted from $1 billion, the data show.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 
Those notes traded yesterday at 101.594 cents on the dollar
to yield 3.049 percent, or 124.1 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 
JPMorgan is marketing 10-year fixed-rate debt for the first
time since March, when it sold $1.5 billion of the bonds,
Bloomberg data show. The bank will manage today&#8217;s offering, the
person familiar said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
waive tax deductions it could have claimed after paying a $550
million penalty in a settlement with U.S. regulators, giving up
as much as $187.5 million in savings. 
In yesterday&#8217;s settlement with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, the firm agreed &#8220;it shall not claim,
assert or apply for a tax deduction&#8221; for any penalty amounts.
Goldman Sachs will pay a $535 million civil penalty, which
normally would be deductible, and give up $15 million in
profits, which the firm likely can still deduct. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s unusual, but not unheard of&#8221; for companies to forgo
tax deductions when negotiating settlements, said Robert Willens, founder of Robert Willens LLC, a consulting firm that
advises investors on tax and accounting rules. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually
become a little more popular in recent years for the government
to insist that no deduction be taken for any portion of the
payment.&#8221; 
In order to deduct the payments, Goldman Sachs would have
had to argue that a portion were compensatory and would be paid
to third parties rather than the government. Other companies
have argued that position, said Ron Pearlman, a tax law
professor at Georgetown University. 
Explicit Prohibition 
The settlement explicitly bars the company from claiming
deductions &#8220;regardless of whether such penalty amounts, or any
part thereof, are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used
for the benefit of investors.&#8221; 
In Goldman Sach&#8217;s case, Pearlman said, the company &#8220;likely
concluded that it would not be good PR if it became known, as it
undoubtedly would, that Goldman Sachs attempted to deduct the
penalty.&#8221; 
Giving up the tax deduction makes the penalty appear
smaller than paying a larger penalty and retaining the
deductions. Had Goldman Sachs agreed to a $1 billion fine and
kept its federal and state deductions, the net outlay would have
been about $600 million. 
In the settlement, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that
marketing materials for a 2007 deal at the center of the case
contained &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; The SEC&#8217;s suit filed in
April accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-
backed collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them
that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was planning to bet against
the deal, had helped design it.

(Corrects number of units sold in sixth paragraph of story
that ran yesterday.) 
U.S. sales of video games fell 6
percent in June to $1.1 billion after the strong appeal of
Nintendo Co., Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. consoles failed to
offset weak game purchases. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360 sales gained 88 percent to 451,700
units after it introduced a slimmer version of its console with
a larger hard drive. It was the second-largest non-holiday month
of sales for the Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s Xbox 360,
behind the September 2007 release of the game Halo 3, research
firm NPD Group said today in a statement. 
Nintendo sold 422,500 Wii consoles in the U.S. in June, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, NPD said. Sales of
Tokyo-based Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 3 jumped 85 percent to 304,800
units in June. 
Nintendo&#8217;s DS handheld video-game player sales fell by a
third after the Kyoto, Japan-based company said it&#8217;s introducing
a version equipped with three cameras, a wireless connection and
a screen that displays 3-D images without the use of special
glasses. The company plans to start selling the 3DS player
before March 2011, prompting a 39 percent decline in May. 
Games sales fell 15 percent to $531 million, hurt by a
relatively weak lineup of large-franchise titles as game
publishers hold major releases for the second half of the year,
which historically delivers higher sales. 
Red Dead Redemption, from New York-based Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc., remained the top-selling video game
for a second month, with 963,000 units purchased for Xbox 360
and PS3, NPD said. Nintendo&#8217;s Super Mario Galaxy 2 sold 548,000
units for the Wii. 
&#8220;Sales are more concentrated this year on the top-selling
games,&#8221; NPD analyst Anita Frazier said in the statement.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s $550
million settlement with U.S. regulators yesterday will benefit
the firm by ending three months of uncertainty at an affordable
price. Now the rest of Wall Street begins calculating the cost. 
Investors welcomed the deal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, saying the company won key points: The cost
was below some analysts&#8217; estimates of at least $1 billion; no
management changes were required; and Goldman Sachs said the SEC
indicated it doesn&#8217;t plan claims related to other mortgage-
linked securities it examined. The stock&#8217;s late surge on
anticipation of a settlement yesterday added more than $3
billion to the company&#8217;s market value, and it climbed further
after New York trading closed. 
&#8220;You&#8217;d have to look at it as a victory for Goldman,&#8221; said
Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages $13.3 billion including
Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;This takes a cloud off the stock.&#8221; 
In the settlement, unveiled less than two hours after the
Senate passed legislation to reform the financial system and
avert future crises, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that marketing
materials for the 2007 deal at the center of the case contained
&#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; In its April 16 suit, the SEC
accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-backed
collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them that
hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was planning to bet against the
deal, had helped to design it. 
&#8216;One of the Worst Days&#8217; 
In its original public response, Goldman Sachs had called
the SEC&#8217;s case &#8220;unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and maintained that
it made all disclosures about the CDOs that should be material
to the &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; investors who lost money on the deal.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, who said
the day the suit was filed was &#8220;one of the worst days in my
professional life,&#8221; said in May that the bank established a
committee to review the firm&#8217;s business standards. 
The settlement requires the New York-based company to
increase training for employees who structure or market mortgage
securities, and to bolster the vetting and approval process.
Those changes will probably lead to a new industry standard for
disclosures in private sales of securities, even to the most
sophisticated investors, analysts said. 
&#8220;All of the firms are going to adjust their internal
standards for this,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. in New York, said in an interview. The agreement
means &#8220;a private placement doesn&#8217;t absolve you from the
accuracy of the disclosure and you&#8217;d better have very, very good
compliance watching what your sales people are saying.&#8221; 
&#8216;Best Practices&#8217; 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s director of enforcement, said at
a news conference yesterday that his agency means to send a
signal to the entire industry. 
&#8220;We would strongly encourage other institutions to adopt
any kinds of best practices that they see across the street in
order to prevent this kind of wrongdoing,&#8221; said Khuzami, 53.
&#8220;The deterrence, and preventing a fraud before it occurs, is a
much better outcome than picking up the pieces afterwards.&#8221; 
The SEC is still investigating other companies and a range
of products that fueled losses during the financial crisis,
Khuzami said. Last month, the agency sued New York-based ICP
Asset Management LLC on claims that it improperly traded assets
in CDOs it managed. ICP has denied wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement that the SEC doesn&#8217;t plan
to target the firm over any other products that the agency has
reviewed. 
Case Against Tourre 
&#8220;We understand that the SEC staff also has completed a
review of a number of other Goldman Sachs mortgage-related CDO
transactions and does not anticipate recommending any claims
against Goldman Sachs or any of its employees,&#8221; the firm said. 
The SEC&#8217;s case continues against Fabrice Tourre, the only
Goldman Sachs employee the agency sued over the CDO. Tourre, 31,
is due to respond to the complaint by July 19. He told a Senate
subcommittee in April that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denies the SEC&#8217;s
allegations and will fight them in court. 
The SEC&#8217;s deputy enforcement director, Lorin Reisner, said
Goldman Sachs agreed to cooperate in the case against Tourre,
who is on leave and whose legal expenses are being paid by the
company. Tourre&#8217;s attorney, Pamela Chepiga at Allen  Overy LLP,
didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail and phone message. 
Blankfein, 55, and the firm&#8217;s other senior managers may not
emerge from the SEC case unscathed, even if they weren&#8217;t forced
to resign. 
&#8216;Repair Their Reputation&#8217; 
&#8220;Within a decent interval, you&#8217;re probably going to see a
new CEO,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a New York Federal Reserve
official in the 1980s and co-founder of Institutional Risk
Analytics, in an interview on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;They still
have a lot of work to do with clients and may face claims and
litigation going forward, and they have to repair their
reputation.&#8221; 
William Cohan, an author and former investment banker who
is writing a book about Goldman Sachs, said that Blankfein&#8217;s
position is secure for the &#8220;foreseeable future.&#8221; Cohan expects
the next CEO will come from an investment banking background
rather than trading, the business drawing regulators&#8217; scrutiny. 
&#8220;I will predict that this is the last trading-oriented CEO
of Goldman Sachs for a while,&#8221; Cohan said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. 
SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, 55, has previously denied
speculation that the lawsuit was filed to support financial-
reform legislation backed by President Barack Obama by casting
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, as a villain. There was &#8220;absolutely no
consideration&#8221; to the bill, Khuzami told reporters, hours after
the bill cleared the Senate. Still, the timing raised some
eyebrows. 
&#8216;Highly Suspicious&#8217; 
&#8220;It is highly suspicious, and it makes the SEC now look
like it is totally politicized,&#8221; said Paul Atkins, a former
Republican SEC commissioner who is now a financial services
consultant. 
While the SEC touted the $550 million settlement as the
largest it ever levied against a Wall Street firm, it fell short
of some analysts&#8217; estimates for a $1 billion fine. Hintz, who
estimated the agreement will shave 93 cents from the firm&#8217;s
earnings, said he had predicted it would cost $1.05 per share. 
For Goldman Sachs, the cost represents about 14
days&#8217; worth of earnings, based on first-quarter profit.
Blankfein, who was awarded a record-setting $67.9 million bonus
for 2007, has stock in the firm that&#8217;s worth almost $490
million, based on the firm&#8217;s last proxy statement. 
Shares Gain 
The SEC&#8217;s disclosure yesterday that it planned a
&#8220;significant announcement&#8221; fueled speculation that a deal was
imminent, sending the firm&#8217;s shares up 4.4 percent to $145.22 at
the end of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock,
which had lost more than 20 percent since the suit was filed, is
likely to rise further, said Hintz. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m jumping up and down and telling my dad to buy it,&#8221;
Hintz said of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it upgraded its rating
on Goldman Sachs to &#8220;buy&#8221; in a note to clients following the
agreement yesterday. 
The settlement is &#8220;palatable&#8221; and the &#8220;probability of
further action against Goldman Sachs&#8221; is much lower, said
analysts led by New York-based Guy Moszkowski in the note. 
Goldman Sachs rose 5.1 percent to $152.59 at 9:50 a.m. in
German trading.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, fell in
late trading after the company reported revenue that missed
analysts&#8217; estimates and a decline in services-contract signings. 
Revenue last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, the
Armonk, New York-based company said today. Analysts on average
estimated $24.2 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500 million, IBM said. 
Services signings declined 12 percent to $12.3 billion,
suggesting corporate customers are delaying projects even as the
economy recovers. It&#8217;s the second straight quarterly decline in
contracts for services, which makes up more than half of IBM&#8217;s
total revenue. Shares fell as much 4.3 percent in late trading. 
&#8220;Investors simply want to see a bit more in terms of
revenue and bookings,&#8221; said Andy Miedler, a St. Louis-based
analyst at Edward Jones who rates the shares &#8220;buy.&#8221; &#8220;The
market is in &#8216;show-me&#8217; mode. You can&#8217;t just tell us you&#8217;re going
to do this.&#8221; 
IBM also boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts&#8217; average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20. 
Signings declined last quarter as many customers didn&#8217;t
renew contract extensions while some clients put off closing
contracts until the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. 
Loughridge cautioned against viewing the results as a sign
of &#8220;a pullback in spending.&#8221; The rollover of deals into the
current quarter &#8220;should accelerate performance in the
outsourcing signings,&#8221; he said. 
Shares Fall 
IBM fell as much as $5.59 to $124.20 in extended trading
after reporting the results. The stock closed at $129.79 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and has lost less than 1
percent this year. 
IBM gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe, whose
currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Whitmore. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a headwind,&#8221; said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who rates the shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. 
Net income climbed to $3.39 billion, or $2.61 a share,
compared with $3.1 billion, or $2.32, a year earlier. Analysts
estimated earnings of $2.58 a share. 
Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it would
introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week. 
Acquisition Outlook 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more profitable software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total profit in five years, Palmisano
has said. 
Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in acquisitions
in the timeframe. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructures to
help them run more efficiently. 
Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said.

Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, disputed regulators&#8217; allegations
in a filing today. 
Tourre in his filing today in federal court in Manhattan
denied wrongdoing and said he was aware that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. &#8220;was considering taking some or all of the short side&#8221;
of a transaction involving the 2007 sale of a collateralized
debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1 that was linked to
subprime mortgages. 
Tourre responded four days after Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, agreed to
settle its role in the case for $550 million. The firm also will
cooperate in the SEC&#8217;s investigation of Tourre, 31, who remains
an employee. Tourre is on leave and his legal expenses are being
paid by New York-based Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;The purported claims against Mr. Tourre and the
allegations upon which they are based are improperly vague,
ambiguous and confusing, and omit critical facts,&#8221; the filing
said. &#8220;Mr. Tourre, a French citizen and engineer by training,
reasonably relied on Goldman Sachs&#8217; institutional process to
ensure adequate legal review and disclosure of material
information, and cannot be held liable for any alleged failings
of that process.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. sued the Texas
Rangers, claiming the bankrupt baseball team breached the terms
of a loan by taking over the lease for its stadium, Rangers
Ballpark. 
Transferring the lease to Texas Rangers Baseball Partners
made it harder for lenders to collect at least $411 million owed
by the team&#8217;s owner, Tom Hicks&#8217;s HSG Sports Group LLC, JPMorgan
said in a lawsuit filed July 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Fort
Worth, Texas. 
When HSG borrowed the money, it agreed that certain units
and affiliates would help pay back the loan if necessary,
according to court papers. The HSG unit that controlled the
lease was obligated to repay the full amount while Texas Rangers
Baseball Partners was liable only for $75 million, New York-
based JPMorgan said in court documents. 
After filing for bankruptcy in May, the Rangers, based in
Arlington, Texas, sought court permission to sell the club to a
group led by Hall of Fame pitcher and team President Nolan Ryan
and attorney Chuck Greenberg in a transaction valued at more
than $500 million. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge D. Michael Lynn ordered the team put
up for auction on Aug. 4, with the Ryan-Greenberg group acting
as the lead bidders. Afterward, he will consider approving the
company&#8217;s bankruptcy exit plan, which details how the money
generated from a sale would pay creditors. 
July 28 Deadline 
Creditors have until July 28 to vote on the plan, which
means they won&#8217;t know the outcome of auction when they cast
their ballots. Lynn must take those votes into consideration
when deciding whether to approve the bankruptcy exit plan. 
Lenders, led by JPMorgan, oppose the sale, arguing that it
doesn&#8217;t give competitors time to prepare. 
JPMorgan, the agent for investors who loaned the money to
HSG, asked the judge to declare the transfer null and void
because it violated the mortgage on the property. The lease on
the stadium in Arlington, Texas, is collateral for the loan,
according to court documents. 
Mark Semer, a spokesman for the Rangers, declined to
comment. 
The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth).

The U.S. economy faces a period of
&#8220;protracted sluggishness&#8221; as consumers are wary to spend, said
Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chairman for Asia. 
&#8220;The U.S. is, I think, in the early stages of what is a
very protracted sluggishness of domestic internal demand,&#8221;
Roach, who is also a professor at Yale University, said in a
radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt on &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance.&#8221; 
The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than previously calculated, reflecting a
smaller gain in consumer spending and a bigger trade gap, data
showed last month. Consumer confidence slumped in July to the
lowest level in a year, signaling that the biggest part of the
economy is losing momentum, according to the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment published on July 16. 
&#8220;The dynamism that we&#8217;ve gotten hooked and accustomed to,
is just not going to be&#8221; there, Roach said. 
The U.S. housing market took another step back in June as
construction and purchases dropped, and a gauge of the outlook
for growth signaled the expansion will lose steam, economists
said before data due to be published later this week. Housing&#8217;s
inability to maintain a rebound is one reason the economic
recovery is not gaining speed. 
Stimulus Debate 
President Barack Obama said on July 15 that his economic-
stimulus program is gradually pulling the U.S. out of its
deepest recession in decades. Republicans have said the stimulus
is wasteful, hasn&#8217;t reduced unemployment and has added to the
record budget deficit. 
&#8220;The president is walking a fine line&#8221; between stimulus
and budget cuts, Roach said. &#8220;What the markets are ultimately
going to want is far more specificity and credibility on deficit
reduction and normalization of Fed policy.&#8221; Federal Reserve
policy makers last month restated a pledge to keep the benchmark
lending rate at around zero for &#8220;an extended period.&#8221; 
Roach also said that the savings rate in China, one of the
biggest buyers of U.S. debt, is still high and rising. &#8220;It is a
savings rate driven more by fear than by life-cycle rational
motives, if you deal with that fear, you can reduce that excess
saving,&#8221; he said. 
Reducing savings may boost Chinese domestic demand, helping
the country to cope with weak exports to Europe and the U.S.,
where demand fell following the recession. China has depended on
exports to the U.S. and Europe to fuel its economic growth over
the past decades. 
China&#8217;s Model 
&#8220;China has to shift the model if it wants to continue to
maintain rapid growth and avoid social instability, and focus on
deriving support from internal private consumption,&#8221; Roach
said. 
Morgan Stanley cut its full-year economic growth forecast
for China by about 1 percentage point to around 10 percent.
Roach expects economic growth will hold at around 10 percent
over the next couple of years. 
&#8220;Per capita gross domestic product in China is still a
real laggard,&#8221; he said. It will take China at least 50 years
before China&#8217;s gross domestic product per capita catches up to
&#8220;anything close&#8221; to that of the developed world, he said.

A surge in imports and slower
consumer spending reduced U.S. economic growth in the second
quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
The world&#8217;s largest economy grew at a 2 percent annual pace
from April through June, down from a previously estimated 3
percent pace, according to revised estimates by Goldman
economists. Forecasts for the second half of the year remained
at an average 1.5 percent pending the government&#8217;s annual
revisions to gross domestic product due July 30. 
&#8220;At that point, we may need to make downward revisions,
judging from the relentless run on disappointments in recent
weeks,&#8221; Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New
York wrote in a July 16 note to clients. &#8220;While it is
conceivable that the slowdown will prove fleeting, several
factors strongly suggest otherwise.&#8221; 
Among the issues that will damp growth in the second half
are the loss of support from fiscal stimulus and inventory
replenishment, the excess supply of vacant housing, state and
local budget constraints, a lack of credit, and weak employment
gains, McKelvey said. 
The cut in the growth forecast follows similar reductions
by economists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities LLC in
New York.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
second-quarter profit dropped 82 percent, missing analysts&#8217;
estimates on a slide in trading revenue five days after settling
U.S. regulators&#8217; fraud allegations. 
Net income fell to $613 million, or 78 cents a share, from
$3.44 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.99 per
share, with estimates ranging from 77 cents to $4.34. Some of
the analysts didn&#8217;t include costs of the settlement. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, is working to restore the firm&#8217;s reputation
after agreeing to pay $550 million to settle the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud accusations. The bank&#8217;s bigger
competitors, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., last week also
reported lower trading revenue as market gyrations reduced
clients&#8217; willingness to take on risk. Concern that the U.S.
economic rebound will stall and reform legislation will crimp
profits at finance companies have weighed on their stocks. 
&#8220;The clouds over the financial industry remain thick,&#8221;
said Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, who manages more than $650
million. Farr, who sold his Goldman Sachs stock when the SEC
suit was filed on April 16, said he&#8217;s considering buying again. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got probably the greatest, most innovative
investment bank in the world, leading the category, which looks
cheap,&#8221; Farr said before earnings were released. &#8220;I have not
put my money back in yet but I am taking a close look at doing
just that.&#8221; 
Share Performance 
Goldman Sachs fell 49 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $145.68 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, leaving the
stock down 14 percent this year through yesterday. The SP 500
Financials Index, which tracks the performance of 80 financial
company shares, is down 2 percent this year. 
The company&#8217;s shares rebounded last week on news that the
firm had reached a settlement with the SEC over its 2007 sale of
a collateralized debt obligation. The cost was lower than the $1
billion some analysts had estimated and the settlement didn&#8217;t
require any management changes. Analysts slashed earnings
estimates in recent weeks on concern market declines would hurt
trading revenue as well as on costs related to the settlement
and a one-time bonus tax imposed in the U.K. 
&#8220;People have gotten overly pessimistic on Goldman,&#8221;
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
before the earnings were released. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve
lost big chunks of their client base, and we do believe in their
risk-management capabilities.&#8221; 
Bank of America 
Shares in some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest rivals fell last
week after they reported revenue that was lower than investors
predicted. JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s second-quarter net revenue dropped 9
percent from the first quarter as revenue at the investment bank
unit slid 24 percent. Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s revenue fell 9
percent as global banking and markets revenue tumbled 38
percent. 
Morgan Stanley, which was the second-biggest securities
firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008,
is due to report earnings tomorrow. 
Investors and analysts said before the earnings that
they&#8217;re keen for news on how the settlement, which imposes
changes to the way Goldman Sachs sells mortgage-related
securities, and the wider financial regulatory reform bill
passed by the U.S. Senate last week will affect earnings. 
&#8220;I do think there will actually be business reforms where
their risk taking might be reined in,&#8221; said Portales Partners
LLC&#8217;s Peabody. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question that Goldman
did play in the grey areas&#8221; and curbing that &#8220;reduces your
opportunities.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most trading equities, lost money in the second
quarter by betting on a drop in stock-market volatility just as
a gauge of equity-price swings surged to a one-year high. 
&#8220;Primarily in response to our client needs, our equity
derivatives business was short volatility entering the second
quarter and posted poor results,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call with reporters today. The firm
didn&#8217;t break out the size of the loss or the overall results
from the equity derivatives group responsible for the business. 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the
VIX, is the most widely used measure of volatility. The index,
which started the second quarter at 17.47, rose as high as 45.79
on May 20 before ending the quarter at 34.54. The index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, has averaged 20.38 over its
two-decade history. 
Goldman Sachs said the division&#8217;s revenue slumped 62
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to $1.21
billion. Still, the unit&#8217;s revenue beat equities divisions at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
in the quarter. 
&#8216;Volatility Just Spiked&#8217; 
Clients wanted to hedge against an increase in volatility,
Viniar said on the call. &#8220;We took the other side because you
know we deal with our clients all the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had
that position going into the quarter and volatility just
spiked.&#8221; 
The client demand described by Viniar seems to indicate
that clients took the opposite tack of the one recommended by
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own economics and strategy team. In a Dec. 2,
2009, note about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;top trades for 2010,&#8221; the
first recommendation made to clients is that they hold short
positions in so-called variance swaps as a way of betting on
falling volatility. 
&#8220;Even in a sluggish recovery and a range-bound equity
market, as macro-driven uncertainty declines, volatility can
continue to moderate,&#8221; the note said. 
Risks Not Offset 
Some investors and analysts expressed surprise that Goldman
Sachs, which prides itself on its risk-management success,
didn&#8217;t have positions that could hedge any losses. 
&#8220;I would think they&#8217;d try to hedge out and offset those
risks,&#8221; said Benjamin Wallace, an analyst at Grimes  Co. in
Westborough, Massachusetts, which manages $800 million and
doesn&#8217;t hold Goldman Sachs stock. 
Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
asked Viniar on a call with investors today why the firm didn&#8217;t
have any hedges against the jump in volatility. 
&#8220;I would say we didn&#8217;t hedge it fast enough,&#8221; Viniar
replied. &#8220;Things spiked really dramatically really fast.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street profit record for a
U.S. securities firm in 2007, reported today that second-quarter
profit tumbled 82 percent from a year earlier as revenue from
trading equities as well as fixed-income, currencies and
commodities dropped 44 percent from a year earlier. The stock
rose 2.2 percent to $148.91 as of 6:10 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. 
Viniar said the firm reduced the size of its market bets
during the quarter to the lowest in three years as measured by
value-at-risk. VaR, a statistical measure of how much the firm
could lose in a single day of trading, dropped to an average of
$136 million in the quarter from $161 million in the first
quarter and $245 million a year earlier. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of hard to fault them for being wrong every now
and then,&#8221; said Alan Villalon, a senior research analyst at FAF
Advisors, which owns Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;They&#8217;ve kept
raising the bar themselves, but there&#8217;s going to be a hiccup
every now and then.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, slid in
New York trading after missing analysts&#8217; sales estimates and
reporting a drop in services-contract signings. 
Revenue last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, IBM
said. Analysts on average estimated $24.2 billion, according to
a Bloomberg survey. Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500
million, the company said. 
Services-contract signings declined 12 percent to $12.3
billion, the Armonk, New York-based company said, for the second
straight quarterly drop. 
&#8220;The market doesn&#8217;t want to hear words -- it wants to see
results,&#8221; said Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler, who rates the
shares &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing earnings growth. 
IBM&#8217;s outlook remains healthy, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. Signings declined last
quarter because many customers didn&#8217;t extend contracts and some
clients put off signing them until this quarter, he said. IBM
actually increased new business signings, he said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would take this and interpret it as a
reflection that there&#8217;s a pullback in spending,&#8221; Loughridge
said. &#8220;The rollover of deals should accelerate performance.&#8221; 
Outsourcing signings should have double-digit percentage
growth in this quarter, Loughridge said. Services growth, as
well as software revenue and new hardware products, will help
IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a currency impact,
he said. 
Forecast Boost 
IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts&#8217; average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20. 
Net income for the quarter climbed 9.4 percent to $3.39
billion, or $2.61 a share, topping analysts&#8217; average estimate of
$2.58 a share. 
The company gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe,
whose currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Whitmore. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a headwind,&#8221; said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who rates the shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. 
Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents a share, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it
would introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week. 
2015 Outlook 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more lucrative software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in five years,
Palmisano has said. 
Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in acquisitions
in that period. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructure to
help these systems run more efficiently. 
Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. 
IBM also announced a shuffling of management duties at the
company yesterday, in an e-mail distributed to employees. Four
top executives will take on additional responsibilities as
Palmisano nears 60, the usual retirement age for the company&#8217;s
CEOs. 
The company fell $3.24, or 2.5 percent, to $126.55 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 3.3 percent this year.

General Atomics Aeronautical Systems
Inc. said it won U.S. approval for an export version of the
Predator drone, clearing the way for the first sales of the
unmanned aircraft in the Middle East. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s interest from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
the United Arab Emirates,&#8221; Frank Pace, president of the
aircraft systems group at the closely held company, said today
in an interview at the Farnborough Air Show near London. 
General Atomics recently received U.S. State Department
approval to offer an unarmed Predator model to countries beyond
the NATO bloc, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, Pace said. That
would allow sales in the Middle East and elsewhere to
governments previously ineligible to buy the planes, he said. 
U.S. Predators are now used to monitor and strike targets
in Iraq, Afghanistan and the border areas of Pakistan. Selling
the aircraft to countries in the Middle East may ease regional
opposition to the surveillance while raising new issues related
to how the buyers fly them, one analyst said. 
&#8220;There could be an argument that if the countries do it
themselves, it&#8217;s less intrusive,&#8221; William Hartung, an analyst
at the New America Foundation, a Washington research group, said
in a phone interview. &#8220;But there&#8217;s still a question of how this
capability is used.&#8221; 
For example, a Pakistani Predator that was sent to monitor
neighboring India would be &#8220;problematic&#8221; because such a
mission might not be in U.S. interests, Hartung said. 
Predator Capabilities 
Predators are popular with U.S. military and intelligence
agencies because they&#8217;re smaller than manned planes and can
loiter over a target for long periods without risk to a pilot.
Missile-equipped Predators can mount attacks via remote control. 
General Atomics see the potential for sales of as many as
100 units in the Middle East and Pakistan of the so-called
Predator XP model approved for export, Pace said. 
&#8220;Saudi Arabia is a huge country, and if they want to cover
the country well, they alone could get 50 aircraft,&#8221; Pace said. 
General Atomics, based in Poway, California, has sold about
435 Predator-series drones, mostly to the U.S. government,
according to spokeswoman Kimberly Kasitz. That total includes
about 25 sold to NATO countries, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand, Kasitz said. The export model also is being promoted in
South America and Mexico, she said. 
That version, based on the model used by the U.S. Army and
the Air Force, will lack the ability to carry weapons and will
be designed only for surveillance and reconnaissance missions,
Pace said. 
Predators range in price from about $4 million for the
basic model to about $15 million for the so-called Avenger
version, Kasitz said. 
General Atomics also builds the Predator B model with
extended range and a new Predator C, the Avenger, that can evade
enemy radar. Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp. also make unmanned aerial vehicles used by the U.S.
military for surveillance and armed missions.

David Viniar, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s chief financial officer, said he&#8217;s &#8220;not aware of any
discussions&#8221; about changing the chief executive officer or
chief operating officer after the firm agreed to a record-
setting settlement with U.S. regulators. 
Some investors and analysts have speculated that CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and Gary Cohn, 49, who serves as president and
COO, may step down in coming months as the New York-based
company attempts to overcome reputational damage from the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. 
&#8220;They must know something I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Viniar, 55, said in a
telephone interview today after the bank reported an 82 percent
drop in second-quarter profit. He added that &#8220;obviously I
wouldn&#8217;t tell you if we were having board discussions about
those things.&#8221; 
Christopher Whalen, a former Federal Reserve Bank of New
York official and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics,
said after the settlement last week that Blankfein would
probably leave &#8220;within a decent interval&#8221; in order to help
repair the company&#8217;s reputation. 
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
last week that he expects Blankfein and Cohn to be gone before
the end of next year. 
They will &#8220;choose a time where they can exit in a manner
that it&#8217;s not tied to the SEC issue and in a manner where they
can walk out with good news on their hip,&#8221; Peabody said. 
Goldman Sachs, which has lost 12 percent on the New York
Stock Exchange this year, gained $2.70 to $148.38 in composite
trading at 2:27 p.m. 
Partner Departures 
Goldman Sachs, which had about 400 partners after the firm
last named new members to the partnership in 2008, will probably
see defections before the end of the year because 15 percent to
20 percent of the partners leave every two years, Viniar said.
He estimated that about half of the 60 or 80 partners that would
be expected to leave have already gone. 
&#8220;There are going to be partners who retire,&#8221; Viniar said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who they are, there&#8217;s no one who&#8217;s being talked
about, there&#8217;s no one who&#8217;s talking about it. But I am sure that
between now and the end of the year there will be partners who
retire.&#8221; 
The amount of money set aside for compensation in the first
half of the year dropped 18 percent even as the total number of
employees climbed 9 percent. 
New Legislation 
The firm hasn&#8217;t had any &#8220;large amounts&#8221; of people leaving
because of new legislation that will affect businesses including
proprietary trading and the special-situations unit, Viniar
said. 
That &#8220;doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t happen in the future but we&#8217;re
not seeing it now,&#8221; he said. 
Goldman Sachs agreed last week to pay $550 million to
settle the SEC&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit, which accused the firm of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation sold in
2007. A new financial regulation law that was passed by the U.S.
Senate last week will probably force changes on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
derivatives-trading business and divisions that invest the
company&#8217;s own money. 
Viniar, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1980, said he remains
happy at the firm. &#8220;I am here because I love Goldman Sachs and
I love what I do,&#8221; he said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, restarted halted units at its Augusta
refinery in Italy after a boiler fault on July 18. 
The failed boiler, the main generator of steam at the site,
brought down oil processing units, a Rome-based spokeswoman for
Exxon said today by phone, declining to be named in line with
company policy. Most of the halted units are back in operation
after the fault, which occurred at about 5 p.m. local time and
led to flaring for a couple of hours, she said. 
The refinery has the capacity to process 190,000 barrels of
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is a
safety measure used to vent gases to prevent pressure build-up
when normal refinery operations are disrupted.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
second-quarter profit dropped 82 percent, missing analysts&#8217;
estimates on a slide in trading revenue five days after settling
U.S. regulators&#8217; fraud allegations. 
Net income fell to $613 million, or 78 cents a share, from
$3.44 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.99 per
share, with estimates ranging from 77 cents to $4.34. Some of
the analysts didn&#8217;t include costs of the settlement. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, is working to restore the firm&#8217;s reputation
after agreeing to pay $550 million to settle the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud accusations. The bank&#8217;s bigger
competitors, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., last week also
reported lower trading revenue as market gyrations reduced
clients&#8217; willingness to take on risk. Concern that the U.S.
economic rebound will stall and reform legislation will crimp
profits at finance companies have weighed on their stocks. 
&#8220;The clouds over the financial industry remain thick,&#8221;
said Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, who manages more than $650
million. Farr, who sold his Goldman Sachs stock when the SEC
suit was filed on April 16, said he&#8217;s considering buying again. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got probably the greatest, most innovative
investment bank in the world, leading the category, which looks
cheap,&#8221; Farr said before earnings were released. &#8220;I have not
put my money back in yet but I am taking a close look at doing
just that.&#8221; 
Share Performance 
Goldman Sachs fell 49 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $145.68 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, leaving the
stock down 14 percent this year through yesterday. The SP 500
Financials Index, which tracks the performance of 80 financial
company shares, is down 2 percent this year. 
The company&#8217;s shares rebounded last week on news that the
firm had reached a settlement with the SEC over its 2007 sale of
a collateralized debt obligation. The cost was lower than the $1
billion some analysts had estimated and the settlement didn&#8217;t
require any management changes. Analysts slashed earnings
estimates in recent weeks on concern market declines would hurt
trading revenue as well as on costs related to the settlement
and a one-time bonus tax imposed in the U.K. 
&#8220;People have gotten overly pessimistic on Goldman,&#8221;
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
before the earnings were released. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve
lost big chunks of their client base, and we do believe in their
risk-management capabilities.&#8221; 
Bank of America 
Shares in some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest rivals fell last
week after they reported revenue that was lower than investors
predicted. JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s second-quarter net revenue dropped 9
percent from the first quarter as revenue at the investment bank
unit slid 24 percent. Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s revenue fell 9
percent as global banking and markets revenue tumbled 38
percent. 
Morgan Stanley, which was the second-biggest securities
firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008,
is due to report earnings tomorrow. 
Investors and analysts said before the earnings that
they&#8217;re keen for news on how the settlement, which imposes
changes to the way Goldman Sachs sells mortgage-related
securities, and the wider financial regulatory reform bill
passed by the U.S. Senate last week will affect earnings. 
&#8220;I do think there will actually be business reforms where
their risk taking might be reined in,&#8221; said Portales Partners
LLC&#8217;s Peabody. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question that Goldman
did play in the grey areas&#8221; and curbing that &#8220;reduces your
opportunities.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley is selling as much as
10 million euros ($12.9 million) of eight-year structured notes
that are linked to euro-area interest rates. 
The bonds pay a fixed 4.5 percent coupon in the first year,
which steps up by 0.25 percentage point in years two, three and
four, according to the term sheet. In the final four years, the
securities pay eight times the difference between the two-year
and 30-year euro swap rate up to a maximum 8 percent. 
Bonds linked to swaps allow investors to bet on the future
direction of interest rates. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s notes perform best
the more the 30-year swap rate, the cost of exchanging fixed for
floating interest payments, is above the two-year rate. 
&#8220;The product is for retail investors interested in the
possibility of high coupons in a low interest-rate
environment,&#8221; said Joern Schiemann, a vice president at Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s derivatives solution group for Germany and Austria. 
The 30-year swap rate is 3.29 percent and the two-year rate
is 1.42 percent. The coupon has a zero percent floor so if
short-term rates rise above longer-dated ones, or invert,
investors won&#8217;t incur a loss on their principle. 
The difference between two-year and 30-year swap rates has
averaged 1.34 percentage points in the past 10 years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. By 2015, the two-year rate will
be about 0.04 percentage point more than the 30-year rate,
according to the forward rate curve. 
&#8220;If we enter a rate hiking cycle in three years the curve
will flatten,&#8221; said Matteo Regesta, an interest-rate strategist
at BNP Paribas SA in London. &#8220;Investors may be enticed by the
huge yields of this product in the short-term, which they can
lock in, while they could lose in the longer-term. In that
respect, the eight times leveraging factor provides a cushion to
such risk.&#8221; 
The initial target issuance size may be increased,
depending on investor demand, according to Morgan Stanley. The
deal is the third series of &#8220;Interest Expander&#8221; notes sold by
the bank and will be listed on Germany&#8217;s Frankfurt and Stuttgart
stock exchanges.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, shuffled
its top management as Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano
nears 60, the usual retirement age for that position. 
Senior Vice President Mike Daniels, who heads technology
services, will now lead the consulting business as well,
Palmisano said in an internal memo sent to IBM employees
yesterday and obtained by Bloomberg News. Ginni Rometty, also a
senior vice president, will lead marketing and strategy, in
addition to her position as head of sales. 
The restructuring could point to succession plans at IBM.
Three of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives have stepped down at
60, and Palmisano, who has led the company for more than eight
years, will hit that mark next July. Daniels and Rometty have
been cited by analysts and former employees as two likely
candidates for the top spot. 
Steve Mills, who&#8217;s headed the software group for a decade,
will take on the hardware division as well. Mills, while well-
respected for helping increase profitability in IBM&#8217;s software
division, may be unlikely to take over the top post since he
also turns 60 next year. 
Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge will now also
oversee IBM&#8217;s financing division as well as its own information
technology, according to the memo. 
&#8220;Over the past several years we have seen great value in
working collaboratively,&#8221; Palmisano said in the memo. &#8220;Today&#8217;s
changes have that in common - they will further strengthen
teaming in support of our strategies and initiatives.&#8221; 
IBM spokesman Edward Barbini, who confirmed the existence
of the e-mail, declined to comment further. 
IBM Succession 
IBM has brought in a CEO from outside the company only
once, when it named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed John Akers
in 1993. Akers, who was forced out by IBM&#8217;s board, was the only
one of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives to leave before 60. 
For the last CEO change, IBM made the succession path clear
more than a year before Gerstner stepped aside. The company
appointed Palmisano, then head of the server business, president
and chief operating officer in September 2000. The formal CEO
announcement came in January 2002, and Gerstner stepped down
from the position March 1, on his 60th birthday. Gerstner
remained chairman through the end of 2002 before Palmisano
assumed that title.

Pfizer Inc., the drugmaker cutting
costs after buying Wyeth, agreed to sell a New York skyscraper
to TIAA-CREF, said two people with knowledge of the transaction. 
The deal for 685 Third Ave. in Midtown sets the price at
$180 million to $190 million, one of the people said. Both
declined to be identified because the transaction isn&#8217;t
complete. 
The deal would be at least the seventh for a Manhattan
skyscraper in the past three months, showing increased
confidence among buyers that the city&#8217;s office market may have
reached bottom. U.S. commercial real estate prices rose for the
second straight month in May, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said
yesterday. 
&#8220;That reflects the demand and competition,&#8221; Robert Bach,
chief economist for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-
based commercial property broker, said in a telephone interview
about the Moody&#8217;s report. 
Manhattan real estate owners sold $2.92 billion of
commercial property in the first half, up 70 percent from a year
earlier, according to preliminary data from New York-based
research firm Real Capital Analytics. About $1.42 billion of
those sales were for office buildings, up 62 percent from a year
earlier. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, told New York
officials in April it planned to sell the 634,000 square-foot
Third Avenue tower as it consolidates operations. 
A Pfizer official declined to comment yesterday. 
Firing Workers 
The company has been firing workers and shutting facilities
following its $68 billion buyout last year of Madison, New
Jersey-based rival Wyeth. It has said it will cut 19,000 jobs,
close eight manufacturing plants and eliminate six research
centers as it seeks to lower costs. 
Pfizer is also bracing to lose patent protection next year
on its top-selling product, the Lipitor cholesterol pill, which
generated $11 billion in 2009 sales. 
In 2003, the New York-based drugmaker said it planned to
spend $1 billion over 15 years to expand in the city and add
jobs. Since then, it has fired 40,000 employees worldwide in
addition to the 19,000 it plans to shed after buying Wyeth. 
The company already stopped receiving city benefits under a
deal intended to lure companies to relocate or expand in New
York. It may have to refund tax breaks and pay penalties of as
much as double the $12 million it got in public benefits, David Lombino, spokesman for the city Economic Development Corp., said
in May.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc plan to build and
deploy a $1 billion rapid-response system to capture and contain
oil in the event of a future underwater well blowout. 
The four companies will contribute $250 million each toward
the creation of a non-profit organization, the Marine Well
Containment Co., that will create and manage containment
equipment and responses in the Gulf of Mexico, Alan Jeffers, an
Exxon spokesman, said today in a phone interview. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering
construction phase, but the plan is to set up a non-profit
organization that will ultimately manage this,&#8221; Jeffers said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s still in the development stages, but we&#8217;re going to ask
others to join and those who choose not to join can have access
to the equipment via commercial arrangements.&#8221; 
BP Plc, which has been struggling to contain an underwater
oil gusher after a Gulf rig exploded in April, wasn&#8217;t listed as
a participant. 
&#8220;Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve said from early on that there will be lessons
learned from this incident and we&#8217;re sure that changes will be
made in the industry.&#8221; 
As part of the new initiative led by Exxon, the biggest
U.S. oil company, equipment will be designed for several
scenarios up to 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) in depth specific to
conditions in the Gulf. The system will be able to mobilize
within 24 hours and have initial capacity to contain 100,000
barrels a day, according to an e-mailed statement. 
Additional costs for equipment, contracts and new vessels
may increase the $1 billion commitment, according to the
statement. The companies said in the statement that they have
reviewed the system with Congress.

Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, posted a 16 percent increase in second-quarter
profit as North American sales volumes climbed for the first
time since 2007. 
Net income rose to $2.37 billion, or $1.02 a share, the
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.06, compared with the $1.03 average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Beverage volume in North America advanced 2
percent, compared with a 1 percent decline a year ago. 
The volume growth in North America, Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest
market, exceeded predictions from analysts such as Mark Swartzberg at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. Coca-Cola benefited from
marketing tied to the 2010 World Cup and from surging sales of
sports beverages like Powerade.

market researcher IBISWorld in Santa Monica, California, said
today in an interview. &#8220;People will invest a couple of bucks to
cool off and refresh themselves.&#8221; 
Coca-Cola gained 84 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $54.08 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has dropped 5.1 percent this year, while rival PepsiCo
Inc. gained 5.2 percent and the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
declined 4.1 percent. 
Coca-Cola&#8217;s growth outstripped PepsiCo&#8217;s in North America,
where a drop in consumer confidence has escalated competition.
PepsiCo posted a 1 percent decline in North American volume in
the second quarter excluding the effect of a distribution deal
with Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. 
Global Results 
Global sales by drink volume grew 5 percent at Coca-Cola,
with the Eurasia and Africa unit showing the fastest growth at
10 percent. Coca-Cola used the World Cup soccer tournament,
hosted by South Africa, to stage its largest marketing campaign,
covering 160 countries and attracting more customers. 
European sales by drink volume fell 1 percent, hurt by
&#8220;ongoing challenges&#8221; in southern and eastern Europe, Coca-Cola
said. Volume growth in the Pacific region, which amounted to 6
percent in the quarter, was hampered by bad weather in parts of
China and Japan, according to the beverage maker. 
&#8220;Consumer sentiment is still not out of the tunnel, in
terms of employment, in terms of real estate, in terms of
banking, in terms of investment,&#8221; Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said today said during a telephone call with
reporters. &#8220;We do see rays of hope.&#8221; 
Total sales advanced 4.9 percent to $8.67 billion. A year
earlier, second-quarter profit at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola was
$2.04 billion, or 88 cents a share. 
Yesterday, Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo reported a 3.4
percent drop in second-quarter profit on costs to integrate its
largest bottlers. Coca-Cola has said it plans to finish its
purchase of the North American assets of its largest bottler in
October, aiming to improve beverage profit and distribution.

Morgan Stanley rose by the most in
more than a year in New York trading after reporting earnings
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and revenue from trading stocks
that surpassed all five of the company&#8217;s bigger competitors. 
The shares surged 6.3 percent, the biggest gain since July
13, 2009, after the New York-based company posted second-quarter
net income of $1.96 billion, or $1.09 a share. Earnings from
continuing operations were 80 cents a share, including a 20-cent
tax benefit, compared with the 47-cent average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has added employees to
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s sales and trading unit to close a gap with
larger competitors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Stock-
trading revenue jumped 82 percent from a year earlier and the 12
percent decline in overall trading revenue from the first
quarter was smaller than the drop at bigger banks. 
&#8220;Quite impressive compared to Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Gary Townsend, chief executive officer of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC
in Chevy Chase, Maryland, which owns Morgan Stanley shares.
&#8220;Morgan has just not had as pronounced a view as Goldman has
had, it has generally been taking less risk over the past
several quarters, and that helped it here.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs yesterday reported earnings that missed
analysts&#8217; estimates as trading revenue fell 36 percent from the
first quarter. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, last week both reported at
least a 34 percent drop in trading revenue. 
&#8216;Taking Market Share&#8217; 
&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing the beginnings of taking market share,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview after earnings were released. 
Morgan Stanley rose $1.58 to $26.80 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at 4:02 p.m. after jumping as much
as 11 percent. The stock, which gained 85 percent in 2009, is
down 9.5 percent this year. 
Revenue at Morgan Stanley rose to $8 billion from $5.2
billion a year earlier. Book value per share climbed to $29.65
from $27.65 at the end of March. The firm&#8217;s return on equity
from continuing operations, a measure of how well it reinvests
earnings, was 12.2 percent. 
In equities trading, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s $1.42 billion of
second-quarter revenue included a $129 million gain as the
firm&#8217;s credit spreads widened. The unit&#8217;s revenue, which was
$776 million a year earlier, compares with $1.21 billion at
Goldman Sachs and $1.04 billion at JPMorgan. 
Trading &#8216;Reality&#8217; 
&#8220;Trading is still the predominant driver of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s business,&#8221; said Mark Lane, an analyst at William
Blair  Co., who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Morgan Stanley.
The Smith Barney joint venture with Citigroup Inc. &#8220;sent a
signal that they are going in a different direction than the
rest of Wall Street, but the reality is that trading still is
the key driver of their business, at least in the near term.&#8221; 
Revenue benefitted from $750 million of gains related to
the widening of the firm&#8217;s own credit spreads. The company
booked $5.1 billion of gains in fiscal 2008 as its bond spreads
widened, then reversed them in 2009 as markets improved and
spreads tightened. 
In the second quarter, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s revenue from fixed-
income sales and trading, excluding gains or losses from its own
credit spreads, was $1.7 billion compared with $2.3 billion a
year earlier. That missed estimates for $1.85 billion from
Howard Chen at Credit Suisse Group AG and $1.89 billion from
Roger Freeman at Barclays Capital. 
Investment Banking 
Morgan Stanley generated $885 million in revenue from
investment banking. 
Global wealth management posted pretax income of $207
million, compared with a loss of $71 million in the second
quarter of 2009, when Morgan Stanley completed its purchase of a
controlling stake in the joint venture with Citigroup&#8217;s Smith
Barney. 
Morgan Stanley said it will miss profit-margin goals for
its brokerage as retail investors shy away from risk following
higher volatility in the second quarter and the May 6 market
crash. The firm may also reach a target for cost savings later
than planned. 
&#8220;Hitting those targets, given it&#8217;s a fairly formulaic
business in many respects, will get pushed out because the
performance is market-dependent,&#8221; Porat said today in an
interview. 
Wealth Management 
Gorman, who led the wealth-management business before
becoming CEO in January, said in February the bank expected to
increase the unit&#8217;s pretax profit margin to 15 percent by the
end of this year and to more than 20 percent by the end of 2011.
The margin was 7 percent in the second quarter, down from 9
percent in the first. 
Asset management reported a pretax loss of $86 million,
less than the $210 million pretax loss in the previous year&#8217;s
period. Net asset outflows were $1.2 billion. 
Compensation and benefits increased 2.2 percent to $3.89
billion in the quarter, or 49 percent of the firm&#8217;s overall
revenue. The cost compared with $3.8 billion in the second
quarter of 2009, when the firm set aside 73 percent of revenue. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s profit may be hurt by the financial-
overhaul bill that President Barack Obama signed into law today.
The bill, which the Senate passed last week after more than a
year of negotiations, increases oversight of derivatives trading
and limits proprietary trading and banks&#8217; investments in private
equity and hedge funds. 
Restoring Trust 
&#8220;Regulatory reforms are a key step toward restoring trust
in the industry and the markets,&#8221; Gorman said in the statement. 
Morgan Stanley could move certain derivatives, including
those tied to interest rates, foreign exchange and risk-
management swaps, into its bank in order to have access to
cheaper funding, Porat said on a conference call with analysts. 
Porat also said that while the firm&#8217;s key concern is the
global economic outlook and a &#8220;fragile&#8221; recovery in the U.S.,
concern that the recession will return is &#8220;overstated.&#8221; 
The firm had a gain from the sale of its retail investment-
management business, including its Van Kampen funds, to Invesco
Ltd. The $1.37 billion purchase, which was announced last year,
was completed on June 1. Results also included a $361 million
charge related to the U.K. bonus tax. 
Sixteen analysts cut their per-share earnings estimates in
the past four weeks, with many citing volatile financial
markets. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 8.2 percent in
May and another 5.4 percent in June. The average earnings
estimate fell 19 cents in the past four weeks.

Morgan Stanley, buoyed by rising
revenue, set aside 37 percent more money to pay employees in the
first half of 2010 even as rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment bank lowered their
compensation expenses. 
Morgan Stanley allocated $7.94 billion to pay employees in
the first six months of 2010, up from $5.78 billion a year
earlier, company data show. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-half
compensation dropped to $9.3 billion from $11.4 billion and
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank set aside $5.3 billion versus $6
billion. All of the figures exclude U.K. bonus tax costs. 
The jump at Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, is connected to an improvement in revenue during the
period that was helped by better trading results than analysts
expected, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at
recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive Search. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s equity trading revenue in the second quarter
outstripped all of its biggest rivals. 
&#8220;They must have extremely good people in those jobs and
they&#8217;re performing,&#8221; Branthover said of New York-based Morgan
Stanley. &#8220;They&#8217;re coming out winners.&#8221; 
Employee Ranks 
The three Wall Street firms added 5,125 employees in the
last year, with more than half -- 2,900 -- joining Goldman
Sachs. That contributed to a drop in average pay per employee at
Goldman Sachs to $272,581 in the first half from $364,135 a year
earlier, while Morgan Stanley&#8217;s average climbed to $126,244 from
$94,465 a year earlier. 
Morgan Stanley added 20,000 employees on May 31, 2009, when
it completed a deal to combine its brokerage unit with Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. The higher first-half compensation cost
this year reflects the fact that those employees were only
counted for June in the first half of 2009. 
Even with the increase, Morgan Stanley is putting aside a
smaller percentage of revenue for compensation expenses compared
with 2009, as first-half revenue more than doubled. The firm set
aside 47 percent of revenue for pay costs, excluding the U.K.
bonus tax, compared with 71 percent a year earlier. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation costs accounted for 43 percent
of revenue, compared with 49 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank set aside 36 percent in the first half, from 38
percent in the first six months of 2009.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. doubled its
lobbying expenses as it focused on proposed financial
regulations and faced U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that it misled investors. 
New York-based Goldman, which paid $550 million last week
to settle the SEC suit, spent $2.7 million to lobby during the
first six months of 2010, more than double the $1.3 million it
spent during the same period a year earlier, according to new
congressional filings. 
Several other financial institutions also increased their
lobbying this year before congressional approval of the biggest
overhaul of financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
measure was signed into law today by President Barack Obama. 
Among the top 10 U.S. banks ranked by assets, six reported
increases in lobbying spending between January and June compared
with the same period in 2009. 
Bank of America Corp. spent $2 million, up 33 percent from
$1.5 million spent during the first six months of 2009. Wells
Fargo  Co.&#8217;s spending rose to $2.3 million from $1.4 million in
2009. Morgan Stanley spent $1.6 million, compared with $1.4
million a year earlier, though its second-quarter lobbying
expenses were lower than a year ago. 
The banks&#8217; trade group, the Washington-based American
Bankers Association, spent $4.2 million, up from $3.9 million. 
&#8220;The increase in our lobbying expenses reflects the
additional analysis and legal support devoted to regulatory
reform and related legislation as it evolved over the last
several months,&#8221; said Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the largest
U.S. bank by assets. 
Higher Costs 
Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, said the higher lobbying costs reflected the company&#8217;s
growth following its acquisition of Wachovia Corp. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s important to stay in tune with the conversations and
decisions that occur in Washington, D.C., because so many of
them impact our four most important stakeholders: our customers,
our shareholders, our team members and our communities,&#8221; she
said. 
Melissa Daly, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. 
As the banks&#8217; lobbying expenses grew, their contributions
to lawmakers decreased. Bank of America&#8217;s political action
committee made $496,500 in donations between Jan. 1, 2009, and
June 30, 2010, down from $716,822 during the same 18-month
period in 2007-08. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s PAC gave $303,500, down from
$663,300 two years ago. New York-based Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s PAC
contributions fell to $499,000 from $756,600. 
Legislation Passed 
Lawmakers reluctant to take money from banks blamed for
causing the economic meltdown don&#8217;t have to worry about it now
that Obama has signed the financial regulation bill into law,
said Rogan Kersh, associate dean at New York University&#8217;s Wagner
School of Public Service. 
&#8220;Once the bill has passed, it&#8217;s much harder for their
opponents or good-government advocates to claim that their vote
was unduly influenced by campaign cash,&#8221; Kersh said.

Journalists call it a buried lead. 
It&#8217;s when the real story is below the newspaper fold and
drowned out by a tidbit that seems more sexy or appealing. Such
is the case with the Asian Development Bank&#8217;s latest outlook. 
Markets moved on the headline: the ADB upgraded its 2010
forecast for 14 East Asian economies to 8.1 percent from 7.7
percent projected in April. Buried was the news that three major
risks must break Asia&#8217;s way to keep prosperity alive: a double-
dip global recession, destabilizing capital flows and the
successful unwinding of stimulus measures. 
&#8220;While most emerging East Asian economies are assured of a
sharp V-shaped recovery this year, it&#8217;s too early to say that
the V stands for &#8216;victory,&#8217;&#8221; Srinivasa Madhur, a senior
director at the Manila-based ADB, said on July 20. 
Asia has had an impressive crisis, and China&#8217;s rapid growth
is bolstering confidence in the region. China&#8217;s dynamism even
prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to raise its targets for a key
index of Asian stocks. Yet Asia is moving into a precarious
period, arguably the most challenging since the late 1990s. 
Goldman&#8217;s V stands for &#8220;valuations,&#8221; and its bet on Asian
shares makes perfect sense in the short run. In a July 14
report, analysts led by Timothy Moe raised their three-month
forecast for the MSCI Asia-Pacific excluding Japan Index to 425
from 405, increased their six-month target to 440 from 430 and
maintained their 12-month target of 485. The index is now 395. 
V for &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217; 
The V may really stand for &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; as U.S. growth
disappoints, investors poke and prod Europe to assess default
risks and Japan&#8217;s woes deepen. Whether healthy growth can be
maintained will depend on the decisions that policy makers take
today about Asia&#8217;s three big challenges. 
First, the global economy. The historic wave of debt
issuance over the last two years stabilized growth. It didn&#8217;t
stimulate it as hoped, and economists are talking about a return
to recession. The same goes for unprecedented interest-rate
cuts. Free money helped banks get back on their feet, but did
little to create new jobs or encourage increased consumption. 
The trouble is, leaders are applying conventional thinking
to very unconventional situations. Calls in Washington for
deficit reduction ignore how comatose the biggest economy
remains. Concerns in Europe that inflation is just around the
corner overshadow the odds of deflation. Talk of recovery in
Tokyo defies reality on the ground. 
&#8216;Protracted Sluggishness&#8217; 
All the stimulus Asians threw at their economies means
little if Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s non-executive chairman
for Asia, is right that the U.S. faces a period of &#8220;protracted
sluggishness.&#8221; Export-dependent Asia can live for a year
without help from a $14 trillion economy. Three or four years
would be another story. Sure, China is booming, yet a $4.3
trillion economy with an undervalued currency is no replacement
for the U.S. economic-growth engine. 
That gets us to challenge No. 2: hot money. Zero-interest-
rate policies in Washington and Tokyo are ricocheting around
Asia and increasing inflation risks. The U.S., Europe and Japan
are putting off finding exit strategies from post-crisis growth
stimulants. Asia doesn&#8217;t have that luxury. 
As inflation pressures mount, countries from South Korea to
Malaysia are letting currencies strengthen. That approach is
more palatable for politicians since China&#8217;s move last month to
scrap its peg to the dollar. 
Currencies on Move 
&#8220;Now that the Chinese yuan is moving again, they can
afford stronger currencies and it&#8217;s less damaging than interest-
rate hikes,&#8221; says Simon Grose-Hodge, a strategist at LGT Group
in Singapore. 
The dynamic may lead to additional obstacles. Overseas
investors seeking profit from the trend may rush to Asia,
swamping the region anew with short-term capital. Managing the
cash glut won&#8217;t be easy. Handled poorly, it will add to asset-
price inflation that Asia will find difficult to control. 
The third risk -- unintended policy errors -- also looms.
This one may say the most about whether Goldman&#8217;s present
optimism translates into enduring gains for Asia&#8217;s economies and
investors in them. 
It would be challenge enough if it were just a matter of
unwinding fiscal measures. Central banks also need to mop up
untold amounts of liquidity -- much of it flowing their way
thanks to ultralow rates in the world&#8217;s biggest economies.
Politicians and monetary officials need to work together to get
the balance right. 
On the one hand, inflation risks are heating up. On the
other, the bulk of the world&#8217;s poor live in Asia. Getting this
mix right is much easier said than done. Asia has never faced
such a delicate process of recalibrating drivers of growth.
After Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in 2008, policy
makers turned on the stimulus and left things on autopilot. 
That was the easy part. The hard part comes as officials
work to move back to normalcy. That time is now, and getting
from &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; to &#8220;victory&#8221; could be a bumpy ride for
those depending on Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;valuations.&#8221;

Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley were chosen by American
International Group Inc. to arrange a Hong Kong initial public
offering of its main Asia life insurance unit, three people with
knowledge of the plan said. 
The underwriting banks will meet tomorrow with AIA Group
Ltd., AIG&#8217;s Hong Kong-based unit, to discuss its IPO, two of the
people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is
private. AIG plans to sell shares in the unit as early as this
year, the people said. 
The New York-based company, which is selling assets to
repay a $182.3 billion bailout by the U.S., is revisiting plans
for a Hong Kong offering of AIA after Prudential Plc scrapped
its purchase of the unit. London-based Prudential&#8217;s $35.5
billion takeover bid for AIA collapsed on June 2 after investors
including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments said the deal
was too costly. 
AIG last year hired New York-based Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt as co-global coordinators of AIA&#8217;s
IPO. It added more bookrunners including Goldman Sachs and
Zurich-based UBS AG, people with knowledge of the matter said in
February. Patricia Chua, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for AIA,
declined to comment. Spokesmen at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley also declined to comment. 
Market Value 
Goldman and Citigroup Inc. of New York earlier estimated
AIA would be worth $32 billion to $34 billion, and Morgan
Stanley estimated the value at $34 billion to $36 billion,
people with knowledge of the figures said in June. 
AIA has more than 23 million customers and offices in at
least 15 countries including China, India and Australia. The
unit had about $1.44 billion in operating profit in 2009, down
from $1.59 billion in 2008, Prudential said in a March filing. 
Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche has overhauled
AIA&#8217;s management, telling staff this week that he named Mark Tucker to replace former head Mark Wilson to have the &#8220;best team
on the field&#8221; for the IPO. 
The unit&#8217;s public offering would be &#8220;ready to go in the
coming months when market conditions are optimal,&#8221; Benmosche
said in a memo to staff, adding that he couldn&#8217;t speculate about
the precise timing.

Going on holiday might be the only
way for currency forecasters to deal with the whipsawing euro,
according to Jim O&#8217;Neill, chief global economist at Goldman
Sachs International. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has reversed its outlook for the
euro twice in two months, calling in its most recent forecast
for the dollar to weaken against the euro by January as U.S.
growth slows. In June, after the euro hit a four-year low, the
bank forecast the greenback would surge to a seven-year high. 
The euro rallied the most this year, gaining 6.9 percent
against the dollar, following Goldman&#8217;s June bearish call. After
the bank switched views July 14 to a bullish euro outlook, the
currency surged for a day before bouncing back down. 
&#8220;Foreign exchange is the world&#8217;s biggest fruit and
vegetable store, with millions of people playing it 24 hours a
day,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said today in a radio interview with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Surveillance. &#8220;Anybody who thinks they can get
foreign exchange right all the time should be in a lunatic
asylum.&#8221; 
The swings in the currency have sent the Goldman research
team on holiday, O&#8217;Neill, 53, joked, leaving the &#8220;the
experienced, aging heads&#8221; in charge. 
Goldman&#8217;s most recent forecast calls for Europe&#8217;s single
currency to fall to $1.22 in three months before rising to $1.35
in six months and $1.38 in a year, according to a research note
dated July 14. The bank&#8217;s six-month outlook takes it back to the
position it held before June 9, when it predicted the common
currency would drop to a seven-year low of $1.15 over three and
six months from a $1.35 forecast earlier. 
Stress Tests 
&#8220;It was pretty obvious to me back in June that the markets
were getting ridiculously too bearish about the euro,&#8221; London-
based O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;I thought we&#8217;d rally all the way up &#8216;til
Friday&#8217;s stress tests, and then we&#8217;d see the reality of what it
was afterwards.&#8221; 
The euro depreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2806 at 1 p.m. in
New York, down from the two-month high of $1.3029 yesterday, on
concern over the pace of the U.S. recovery and the financial
health of European banks. 
&#8220;I am a little bit surprised the euro is back as much as
it&#8217;s done this morning,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, a former board member of
England&#8217;s Manchester United soccer team, said. 
Goldman analysts predicted the euro may weaken this quarter
as confidence in some European governments falters and markets
await the stress tests on 91 of the region&#8217;s banks due July 23. 
Economic Outlook 
Many investors forget that the health of the U.S. economy
will play a significant role in the euro&#8217;s value, said O&#8217;Neill,
who&#8217;s been with the New York-based firm since 1995, when he
started as chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs
International. 
&#8220;The stress tests aren&#8217;t the only thing that matter for the
euro,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Probably just as important over the next few
weeks for the euro is what Bernanke has to say later today about
the implications of Fed policy.&#8221; 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke delivers his
semiannual report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking
Committee today, and testifies to the House Financial Services
Committee tomorrow. U.S. policy makers trimmed growth forecasts
for this year and next at the Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s
June meeting, according to minutes released July 14. 
Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose to 445,000 last
week from 429,000 in the prior period, according to a Bloomberg
survey before tomorrow&#8217;s Labor Department report. The same day,
the National Association of Realtors will say sales of existing
homes fell 9.9 percent in June, according to a separate survey. 
&#8216;English Football&#8217; 
&#8220;Given the disappointing evidence of the past few weeks,
Bernanke has to give some hope that he will find additional ways
of being so accommodative, possibly more, to make sure financial
conditions don&#8217;t tighten any further,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. 
The real news may come during the second testimony
tomorrow, according to O&#8217;Neill, who said the key is whether
Bernanke decides to tie monetary accommodation more specifically
to a 2 percent target for inflation. 
While Bernanke has produced &#8220;very credible ideas as to
how the Fed would fight deflation,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said, as economic
challenges grow the chairman must demonstrate he knows how to
avoid the deflationary period Japan experienced in the 1990s. 
&#8220;Fingers crossed,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;Otherwise, we&#8217;ll all
have to watch English football.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, is lagging rivals in regaining debt
investors&#8217; confidence after the 2008 financial crisis, trading
in credit-default swaps shows. 
Contracts on Morgan Stanley, which last month climbed to
the widest relative to its peers in more than a year, trade 55
basis points higher than those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
other Wall Street firm that converted into a bank after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy almost two years ago,
according to data provider CMA. 
Since Lehman&#8217;s failure, Morgan Stanley has sought to reduce
its reliance on trading businesses by purchasing a controlling
stake in a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney
brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in client assets. Derivatives
prices signal investors remain concerned that Morgan Stanley,
which reported earnings today that beat analysts&#8217; estimates, is
most vulnerable if market confidence were to evaporate again. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a difference in their business model,&#8221;
said Michael Donelan, who oversees $3.5 billion of bonds as
director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan Labs Inc.
in New York. &#8220;Morgan has been lagging on the operating side.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley credit swaps have climbed 92 basis points
since April 15 to 214 basis points, CMA prices show. The
contracts dropped 12.5 basis points today after the earnings
report. They have fallen from a more than one-year high of 305
basis points on June 10 as investor concern eases that sovereign
debt strains in Europe will derail the global economic recovery. 
Earnings Beat Estimates 
The bank reported second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 80 cents a share, which included a 20-cent tax
benefit, compared with a 47-cent average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
profit margins will remain &#8220;subdued&#8221; for 2010. 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment on
the swaps prices. 
Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds instead of government debt
remained at the lowest since May. Corporate bond spreads were at
187 basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, unchanged for a
third day at the lowest since May 20, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate Index.
Yields fell to 3.854 percent from 3.87 percent on July 19. 
Benchmark credit-default swaps indexes that gauge investor
perceptions of credit risk declined in the U.S. and Europe. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 0.4 basis point to 109.6 basis points as of 12:16 p.m. in
New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 5 basis points to 114.7, Markit prices show. 
Goldman Swaps 
The indexes typically decline as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of bonds
and loans. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs fell 5 basis points
to 159.5 today after yesterday reporting second-quarter profit
that was below analysts&#8217; estimates, CMA prices show. Goldman
Sachs, which settled U.S. fraud charges last week by paying a
$550 million penalty, reported earnings of 78 cents a share,
below the average analyst estimate of $1.99 a share in a
Bloomberg survey. 
Converted to Banks 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs converted to bank holding
companies in September 2008 amid the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression, giving the Federal Reserve
regulatory oversight over the firms and allowing them to
increase funding through deposits from retail investors. 
Both firms said at the time that they intended to increase
their base of insured deposits, viewed by investors as a more
secure form of funding than borrowing in the markets. 
Morgan Stanley had $64 billion in bank deposits at the end
of March, up from $36 billion as of August 2008, according to
regulatory filings. Goldman Sachs had $38.4 billion in deposits
as of March, compared with $29.1 billion. 
Private Bank 
Morgan Stanley is building a private bank to offer more
products such as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney clients. It has hired 100 bankers for the
new unit and may quintuple their numbers by the end of 2011, a
person with knowledge of the strategy said last month. 
Investors demand 260 basis points in extra yield to own
Morgan Stanley debt instead of Treasuries, 9 basis points wider
than the average for U.S. banks, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. 
&#8220;Broad market uncertainty tends to be more negative for
Morgan Stanley than it does for the commercial banks,&#8221; said
Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors. &#8220;And
historically, it&#8217;s less of a negative for Goldman Sachs than
Morgan Stanley.&#8221; 
The gap in spreads between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
has almost quadrupled since the end of 2009, when the difference
was 15.1 basis points, CMA prices show. 
&#8220;Should they trade that wide to Goldman?&#8221; said Ryan Labs&#8217;
Donelan, who said he expects Morgan Stanley to issue bonds soon.
&#8220;Well, the market&#8217;s telling you yeah, but we&#8217;re actually
looking at them as a buy.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit-default swaps had increased 67
percent in the past quarter, nearly double the average spread
widening on North American financial companies, Fitch Ratings
said yesterday in a statement. Goldman Sachs spreads increased
32 percent and Wells Fargo  Co. contracts widened 16 percent,
Fitch said. 
&#8220;Concerns over lingering sovereign risks, a double-dip
recession and financial reform implications have sent spreads in
the North American financial sector wider by 34 percent,&#8221;
Jonathan Di Giambattista, a managing director at Fitch, said in
the statement. &#8220;Morgan Stanley is an outlier, however.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley said it will miss
profit-margin goals for its brokerage joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney, blaming the May 6 market crash
for scaring away investors. 
&#8220;Hitting those targets, given it&#8217;s a fairly formulaic
business in many respects, will get pushed out because the
performance is market-dependent,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today in an interview. 
James Gorman, who led the wealth-management business before
becoming chief executive officer in January, said in February
the bank expected to increase the unit&#8217;s pretax profit margin to
15 percent by the end of this year and to more than 20 percent
by the end of 2011. The margin was 7 percent in the second
quarter, down from 9 percent in the first, Morgan Stanley said
today in announcing earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Gorman, 52, also set out a goal of more than $20 billion in
net new client assets for this year and $50 billion for 2011.
The wealth-management unit, led by Charles Johnston, had new
asset outflows of $5.5 billion in the second quarter, after $9.3
billion of net new client assets in the first. 
The so-called flash crash of May 6 erased $862 billion in
value from U.S. equities in less than 20 minutes. Consulting
firm Accenture Plc fell as much as 99 percent before rebounding,
and almost 20,800 trades were later canceled. Regulators have
put circuit-breaker programs in place to help prevent short-term
panics. 
&#8216;Sheer Randomness&#8217; 
&#8220;The impact that the flash crash had on the individual
investor psyche, it almost seems that the sheer randomness of it
was kind of the tipping point,&#8221; Porat, 52, said. &#8220;We saw a
real step-back from the market, and given that this is a scale
business, having that activity pull out, particularly the
transaction-related activity, put real pressure on the
margins.&#8221; 
Global wealth management posted pretax income of $207
million, compared with a loss of $71 million in the second
quarter of 2009, when Morgan Stanley completed the joint
venture, the company said today. The unit had $3.07 billion in
revenue, down from $3.11 billion in the first quarter. 
Gorman said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month
that the joint venture will play &#8220;an increasingly important
role&#8221; in the firm&#8217;s growth. 
&#8220;We need retail investors to re-engage,&#8221; Porat said in the
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to execute, because that&#8217;s what we
can do and that positions us better for those days that always
do return, but for now our view is that hitting the targets in
our metrics that matter will get pushed out.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which was

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, posted its biggest sales gain in 2 1/2 years in
the fourth-quarter after customers purchased more personal
computers running the Windows operating system. 
Net income climbed 48 percent to $4.52 billion, or 51 cents
a share, exceeding the 46-cent average of analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales advanced 22 percent to $16 billion,
the company said today in a statement. 
Microsoft is benefitting from a recovery in spending as
large businesses buy new PCs and servers. The company said today
it has sold 175 million copies of the latest flagship product,
making Windows 7 the fastest-selling operating system in the
history of the Redmond, Washington-based company. Global PC
shipments jumped 21 percent last quarter, according to research
firm Gartner Inc. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty clear that there is both a PC and server
buying cycle and Windows 7 is a winner,&#8221; said Katherine Egbert,
an analyst at Jefferies  Co. in San Francisco, who advises
buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;People are obviously buying it despite
all the hype around Apple.&#8221; 
Microsoft was little changed in after-hours trading after
climbing 72 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $25.84 at 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have dropped 15
percent this year. 
Analysts had predicted Microsoft would have total sales of
$15.3 billion in the quarter, which ended June 30. 
Apple Inc., which competes with Microsoft in operating
systems for computers, tablets and mobile phones, reported
quarterly sales this week of $15.7 billion, topping estimates. 
Renewal Rates Rise 
Microsoft said operating expenses for the year starting
July 1 will be $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion, down from its
March forecast of $27 billion to $27.5 billion. Microsoft no
longer provides projections for sales and profit. 
Fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $14.8 billion, above the $14.7 billion estimate
of Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New York. 
Signs of demand by businesses for bigger purchases improved
in the quarter. Renewal rates of multiyear enterprise agreements
reached the highest rate for the year, returning to Microsoft&#8217;s
historical average of 66 percent to 75 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. The company doesn&#8217;t
provide a more specific figure. Billings, a measure of future
revenue, grew 27 percent, he said. 
Sales of agreements that have been signed but for which
customers haven&#8217;t yet been billed rose to about $15 billion,
Microsoft said. That&#8217;s from about $13.5 billion at the end of
the third quarter. 
&#8216;More Evidence&#8217; 
Revenue in the Windows division was $4.55 billion, above
the $4.3 billion estimate of Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG
in San Francisco. Microsoft Business Division sales, made up
mostly of Office software, were $5.25 billion, compared with
Thill&#8217;s $5.05 billion projection. 
&#8220;It sounds like enterprises are buying Windows 7 and will
roll it out at some point,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, who recommends
buying the shares and doesn&#8217;t own any himself. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen more
and more evidence of a recovery in enterprise spending.&#8221; 
Server software revenue was $4.01 billion. Thill had
estimated $3.85 billion. 
Entertainment and Devices, the unit that includes Xbox and
mobile phones, came in at $1.6 billion in sales. Thill had
expected sales of $1.58 billion. 
Online Sales 
The Online Services unit had sales of $565 million, short
of Thill&#8217;s $589 million prediction. Microsoft&#8217;s Bing Internet
search engine gained a percentage point of U.S. market share in
the quarter, rising to 12.7 percent, according to ComScore Inc.
in Reston, Virginia. That compared with 62.6 percent for Google
Inc. and 18.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., which is switching over
to using Bing&#8217;s technology. 
Global PC shipments industrywide rose 21 percent in the
second quarter, Gartner said, beating the firm&#8217;s projection of
19 percent. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, posted
record second-quarter sales last week and said corporate
spending is strengthening. 
Information-technology spending will climb 7.8 percent
worldwide in 2010, according to an estimate from Forrester
Research Inc. 
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Microsoft posted profit
of $3.05 billion, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $13.1
billion. Net income in that period included legal expenses,
severance costs and impairments to investments.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and two other oil companies will spend $1 billion to
research and build a containment system to handle deep-water oil
spills in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Exxon, Shell, Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhilips will each
give $250 million to establish a non-profit organization, the
Marine Well Containment Co., to produce and manage the
equipment. The system will be designed and built over the next
12 to 18 months to handle spills of 100,000 barrels a day in
waters as deep as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), the companies said
in a statement yesterday. 
The oil industry has been criticized by lawmakers in the
U.S. for being unprepared to deal with deep-water accidents,
following the explosion of BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico on April 20. The blast killed 11 people, caused the worst
oil spill in U.S. history and resulted in a six-month ban on
deepwater drilling in the Gulf. 
&#8220;For an incident in deeper waters with higher production
levels, the response capability of containment and spill
response is proven by this incident to be inadequate,&#8221; Jim Mulva, chief executive officer of Houston-based ConocoPhillips,
said in an interview yesterday. The companies have been working
with the government for six weeks on the project, Mulva said. 
The plan may also aim to blunt punitive new government
regulations on drilling, ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a
Washington-based policy analysis firm, wrote in a note to
clients. 
Drilling Moratorium 
A six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling was issued in
May after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig, which BP
leased from Transocean Ltd. A federal judge in New Orleans
rejected the ban as too broad, and Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar responded July 12 with new drilling suspension rules
that have kept deep-water rigs idle. 
Salazar said the six-month drilling moratorium was put in
place while the government reviews drilling safety and
industry&#8217;s ability to contain a well blowout and respond to
another oil spill. The containment system proposal is &#8220;a
beginning point with the conversation relative to how we address
those three fundamental issues,&#8221; Salazar said at a hearing of
the House Oversight and Government Reform committee today. 
&#8220;The proposal announced yesterday is an interesting one,&#8221;
Michael Bromwich, director of Interior&#8217;s Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said at the same
hearing. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to want to review and study it carefully.
We&#8217;ll ask for more elaboration on it from the companies.&#8221; 
Standard Equipment 
The new container system may become standard equipment for
offshore drillers in the U.S. and probably would be adopted in
other places around the world, wrote ClearView analysts Kevin Book, F. Chase Hutto and Amanda Fessenden. 
The equipment would add costs for the industry, while also
providing potential new business for oil-service companies, the
analysts wrote. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering-
construction phase,&#8221; said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
Irving, Texas-based company. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to ask others to join
and those who choose not to join can have access to the
equipment via commercial arrangement.&#8221; 
BP, based in London, isn&#8217;t participating in the containment
project. 
&#8220;They&#8217;ve certainly been informed of what the four
companies have been doing,&#8221; said Mulva. &#8220;When the Macondo
incident is ultimately resolved and the well is killed, we
expect in due time that BP will join the effort.&#8221; 
BP&#8217;s Focus 
BP summoned offshore experts in April, including some from
the four companies, to help devise ways to halt the leak after a
failed attempt to contain the gusher. The company has spent
$3.95 billion on the response as of July 19. 
&#8220;Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said yesterday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
said from early on that there will be lessons learned from this
incident and we&#8217;re sure that changes will be made in the
industry.&#8221; 
Early designs are for a containment system with a tight
seal that will fit over a well near the seabed and channel oil
and gas through pipes leading to vessels at the surface that
will collect and store the fuel, according to a fact sheet
distributed by the new group. The system will be able to
mobilize in 24 hours. 
&#8220;If we all do our jobs properly, this system will never be
used,&#8221; Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, said in the
statement. &#8220;The extensive experience of industry shows that
when the focus remains on safe operations and risk management,
tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing in the Gulf of
Mexico today should not occur.&#8221;

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, will resolve a dispute with
Howard Hughes&#8217;s heirs through an appraisal of property in
Nevada, a judge ruled. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper said today that the
heirs can pursue a full appraisal process without delaying
confirmation of General Growth&#8217;s bankruptcy plan in October. The
company and a shareholder committee had asked the court to make
an estimate, saying an appraisal by the heirs might delay
General Growth&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a number one way or another by October,&#8221;
Gropper said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &#8220;Maybe
we&#8217;ll just have a cap, maybe we&#8217;ll have a simmering dispute.&#8221; 
The Hughes heirs are owed about half of the value of unsold
property at the Summerlin master-planned community near Las
Vegas, which was estimated at $430 million for tax purposes and
given a $1.1 billion book value by Chicago-based General Growth. 
Steven Hoort, a lawyer for the heirs, said the range of
valuations make an appraisal necessary. 
&#8220;The number the debtors use for development costs -- the
number is huge,&#8221; Hoort said. &#8220;We would like to probe that
number in discovery.&#8221; 
The roots of the dispute with the Hughes heirs date to
1976, when the billionaire aviator, industrialist and filmmaker
died at 70, childless and without a will. Rouse Co., a mall
owner based in Columbia, Maryland, bought Hughes&#8217;s remaining
assets, including about 22,500 acres of Nevada land, in 1996 for
$520 million in cash, stock and assumed debt. The heirs were to
get a portion of profits from future land sales under the
agreement. 
Rouse Acquisition 
General Growth bought Rouse in 2004 for $11.3 billion and
assumed the obligation to the Hughes heirs, who have received
semi-annual payments from the sale of land developed as part of
the Summerlin project. Under the deal, any land remaining by the
end of 2009 was to be appraised and the heirs paid. 
Separately, Gropper ruled today that General Growth can
replace its debtor-in-possession financing, which funds
operations while the company reorganizes. The new loan will save
the company $2.7 million a month in interest payments. 
Gropper also approved General Growth&#8217;s motion to auction
property in Clark County, Nevada. 
General Growth&#8217;s initial $400 million loan, dated May 15
2009, will be repaid with the new loan with an interest rate 8
percentage points lower, the company said in court documents.
Barclays Bank Plc is the agent for the new loan, which matures
on May 16 or when the reorganization takes effect, whichever
comes first. 
New Companies 
Under General Growth&#8217;s proposal to exit Chapter 11, it will
fully repay debt and other claims, raise as much as $8.5 billion
of new capital, and issue stock in two new companies to current
shareholders. 
The company&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy is being financed by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LLC. General Growth
has already won court approval to restructure $15 billion of
secured debt tied to 144 properties. 
General Growth began the largest real-estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The company
had amassed a $27 billion debt load while making acquisitions.
It expects to remain the second-largest mall owner in the U.S.,
with 180 properties in 43 states. 
The two new General Growth companies will divide the
assets, with the larger one keeping the name and most of the
malls. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, may raise its quarterly dividend for the first
time since 2008 as its cash hoard swells, data compiled by
Bloomberg suggests. 
This quarter, Microsoft may boost the dividend to 15 cents
a share from 13 cents, giving the company an indicated dividend
yield of 2.31 percent, according to the data. That increase
would cost the software maker about $700 million a year. 
Microsoft, which will probably post its biggest sales gain
in two years when it reports fourth-quarter earnings today, had
$39.7 billion in cash and short-term investments as of March 31.
The company is looking for ways to reward shareholders after a
21 percent slide in the stock price last quarter, compared with
the 12 percent drop in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
&#8220;They really have to do something,&#8221; said Michael Holland,
who oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares,
as chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. &#8220;A dividend increase
is a way for the board and management to signal their overall
business is healthy.&#8221; Not doing it &#8220;would probably send an
unintended signal,&#8221; he said. 
Bloomberg bases its dividend estimates on seven criteria,
including a company&#8217;s dividend history and public forecasts. 
Same Strategy 
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in
January that he would hew closely to the strategy of his
predecessor, Chris Liddell, who stepped down as CFO last year.
The approach included holding a &#8220;target amount of cash&#8221; and
using all operating cash left after capital expenditures and
acquisitions for dividends and share repurchases, Klein said. 
Microsoft spokesman Pete Wootton declined to comment. 
Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New York,
concurs that Microsoft is likely to increase its dividend.
Microsoft has typically focused on growth in operating profit to
determine when to raise the dividend, she said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;For fiscal 2010, given that we are forecasting operating
income growth of 14 percent, we would expect an increase,&#8221; said
Bellini, who advises buying the shares. Bellini also cautioned
that any change to the tax rate on dividends may dissuade
Microsoft from lifting it &#8220;materially.&#8221; 
Microsoft will probably say fourth-quarter earnings per
share rose to 46 cents, the average of analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, from 34 cents a year earlier. Analysts
predict revenue will rise 16 percent to $15.3 billion. 
PC Demand 
The gains were fueled in part by rising demand for personal
computers. Global PC sales rose 21 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. outpacing the research firm&#8217;s forecast
for a 19 percent climb. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, said last week that corporate spending is increasing. 
Some technology companies have been turning away from large
acquisitions, instead accumulating cash, which they may use for
dividends and share buybacks, according to Bloomberg analysis.
With International Business Machines Corp. and Analog Devices
Inc. already boosting payouts this year, there&#8217;s increased
pressure on other technology firms. 
Bloomberg analysis predicts increases from Maxim Integrated
Products, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. and Quality
Systems Inc. 
Over the past decade, Microsoft, with one of the biggest
cash piles among non-banking companies, has experimented with
strategies to return funds to shareholders. 
Payout History 
Microsoft declared its first dividend in 2003, when it had
more than $43 billion in the bank. Less than two years later
with cash mounting, the company paid a special one-time dividend
of $3 a share. 
Microsoft rose 69 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $25.81 at 12:34
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
had lost 18 percent this year before today. 
In 2006, when investors urged the company to repurchase at
least $60 billion of stock, Microsoft tried a $20 billion tender
offer for its own shares. The offer failed to generate enough
interest and investors tendered just $3.8 billion in stock. 
Microsoft is now in the middle of a $40 billion repurchase
program that runs through 2013. The company stopped repurchases
for three quarters during the economic slump to conserve cash. 
Since the recession ended, many investors have shown a
preference for using the cash for payouts rather than buybacks,
Holland said. There isn&#8217;t much evidence that repurchases raise
the stock price, especially with regard to Microsoft, he said.
The stock trades in the same range as it did five years ago. 
Still, a dividend increase may do little to assuage
investors seeking new areas of growth now that Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows 7 operating system is out the door. Some shareholders
are concerned about the company&#8217;s declining market share in
mobile phones and Apple Inc.&#8217;s ascent in tablet-style computers,
said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis, Sayles  Co. in Boston. 
That may pose a threat to notebooks running Windows, said
Ursillo, whose firm owns Microsoft shares. 
&#8220;People cared about Windows 7,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
seem to care about anything else that may be going well for the
company.&#8221;

General Maritime Corp., which just
bought five supertankers, may buy more vessels amid low ship
prices, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer said. 
&#8220;We are still in a time frame where asset values are
attractive relative to potential returns,&#8221; the CFO, Jeffrey Pribor, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;While we will take the
time to digest this transaction, we will certainly be
opportunistically looking for other assets this year and early
next year.&#8221; 
The New York-based company, the second-largest U.S. owner
of oil tankers after Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., has
various resources to finance acquisitions, Pribor said,
including issuing equity, bonds, or using bank loans. 
&#8220;I will never rule out issuing more stock if there is a
use of proceeds for growth that&#8217;s accretive to shareholders,&#8221;
Pribor said from New York. &#8220;We may not need to do that, but if
it looks wise to issue equity to support another acquisition, we
are sure the market will be receptive.&#8221; 
Prices of five-year-old very-large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, averaged $92.7 million in the week ended July 19,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Prices were 43
percent lower than the record high of $162 million reached in
August 2008, though they have gained 20 percent this year. 
General Maritime said on June 9 that it was buying five
VLCCs and two Suezmax ships with a total price of about $620
million. The company is planning to put three of the five VLCCs
into the spot market, according to Pribor. 
Larger Fleet 
After the acquisition, General Maritime will own a fleet of
38 tankers, including seven VLCCs and 13 Suezmax tankers, with a
total carrying capacity of approximately 6 million deadweight
tons. 
The company on June 23 completed an offering of 30.6
million common shares at $6.75 per share. The proceeds,
approximately $195.6 million after expenses, will be used to
fund the purchase. 
VLCC shipping rates fell 16 percent to $10,737 a day today,
according to the Baltic Exchange. The rate has declined 81
percent from June&#8217;s high of $55,242 a day. 
The rate fell to $8,251 a day on July 12, the lowest level
since Nov. 10, 2009.

Stress tests will provide stability
for European lenders and clarity for investors, spurring a rally
in bank debt, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Strategist Alberto Gallo says that the cost of insuring
financial company debt with credit-default swaps will drop to
match that of corporate bonds for the first time since January.
The CHART OF THE DAY shows Gallo&#8217;s forecast that the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index of swaps and the corporate Markit iTraxx
Europe Index will converge. 
Corporate bonds are historically more expensive to insure
than bank debt. That relationship was reversed amid concern the
brunt of Europe&#8217;s government deficit crisis would be borne by
lenders, with the financial gauge exceeding the investment-grade
index by a record 60 basis points on June 8. 
&#8220;Stress tests and other policies coming through are likely
to increase transparency and stability in the financial
system,&#8221; Gallo, who first made the forecast July 13, said in an
interview from New York. &#8220;We see the ratio of iTraxx Financial
and iTraxx Europe going to one.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($12.8 million) of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.

A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit sued
to overturn a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of
the failed hedge fund firm Bayou Group LLC. 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
independent regulatory group for the securities industry, on
June 24 issued the decision in favor of Bayou&#8217;s creditors in an
arbitration targeting Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing LP
for its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for Bayou&#8217;s
hedge funds. 
The creditors claimed the unit facilitated the fraud
committed at Stamford, Connecticut-based Bayou, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in May 2006. Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel pleaded guilty to directing a $400 million fraud and is
serving 22 years in prison. 
&#8220;In rendering its award, the arbitration panel manifestly
disregarded the law and exceeded its authority,&#8221; Goldman said
in its complaint filed today in federal court in New York. 
John Rich, a lawyer who represented the Bayou unsecured
creditors in the arbitration, said the grounds for overturning
an arbitration award are very narrow. 
&#8220;We think it&#8217;s completely without basis,&#8221; Rich said. &#8220;We
look forward to recouping the full award to the Bayou
creditors.&#8221; 
Israel is incarcerated at the same federal prison complex
in North Carolina where Bernard Madoff is serving a 150-year
sentence for orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. 
In addition to Israel&#8217;s 20 year sentence for the fraud, the
court added two years for faking his suicide and disappearing on
the day he was to begin his sentence. 
The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v.
Official Unsecured Creditors&#8217; Committee of Bayou Group LLC, 10-
CV-5622, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, posted record fourth-quarter revenue after the
most successful debut of its flagship operating system. 
Sales gained 22 percent, the biggest quarterly increase in
more than two years, to $16 billion, the company said yesterday.
Net income topped analysts&#8217; predictions, as did revenue for the
division that sells Windows. 
Expectations for Microsoft&#8217;s results ran high after
quarterly reports this month from Intel Corp. and Apple Inc.
blew away analysts&#8217; projections. Still, sales at Microsoft&#8217;s top
three businesses exceeded estimates. The company also said it
has sold 175 million copies of Windows 7 since the program&#8217;s
October release, the fastest pace for its main operating system. 
&#8220;It was a big beat,&#8221; said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at
Caris  Co. in San Francisco who recommends buying the stock.
&#8220;Street expectations have only gone up in the last two, three
weeks.&#8221; 
Revenue in the Windows unit rose 44 percent to $4.55
billion, topping the $4.3 billion projection of Brent Thill, an
analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. Business division sales,
made up mostly of Office software, were $5.25 billion, above his
$5.05 billion estimate. Microsoft released a new version of
Office during the quarter. 
Server software sales of $4.01 billion topped Thill&#8217;s $3.85
billion estimate. 
Microsoft fell 3 cents to $25.81 on the Nasdaq Stock Market
at 4 p.m. New York time. It has lost 15 percent this year. 
Falling Behind? 
Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Oregon, said he expected the shares to rise on the
results. The stock may be held back on investor concern that
Microsoft is falling behind in areas like mobile-phones and
tablet computers. He said his clients are less focused on
results from Windows and Office. 
&#8220;All I can conclude is that shareholders are just not
interested in paying for Windows and Office earnings,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If the stock is not going to move on this, what&#8217;s it going to
take to make it move?&#8221; 
Fourth-quarter net income climbed 48 percent to $4.52
billion, or 51 cents a share, exceeding the 46-cent average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts had predicted
Microsoft would have total sales of $15.3 billion in the period,
which ended June 30. 
Apple, which competes with Microsoft in operating systems
for computers, tablets and mobile phones, reported quarterly
sales this week of $15.7 billion, topping estimates. Intel, the
world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, posted record second-quarter sales
last week and said corporate spending is strengthening. 
Multiyear Contracts 
Microsoft&#8217;s fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of
multiyear contracts, was $14.8 billion, above the $14.7 billion
estimate of Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New
York. 
Signs of demand by businesses for bigger purchases improved
in the quarter. Renewal rates of multiyear enterprise agreements
reached the highest for the year, returning to Microsoft&#8217;s
historical average of 66 percent to 75 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. The company doesn&#8217;t
provide a more specific figure. Billings, a measure of future
revenue, grew 27 percent, he said. 
Revenue from agreements that have been signed but for which
customers haven&#8217;t yet been billed rose to about $15 billion,
Microsoft said. That&#8217;s from about $13.5 billion at the end of
the third quarter. 
Mobile Competition 
Shareholders may remain unimpressed by Microsoft&#8217;s
successes, with the company facing accelerating competition in
mobile and tablet devices from Apple and Google Inc., Barnicle
said. 
Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in
June that the company &#8220;missed a whole cycle&#8221; in mobile-phone
software, underscoring the company&#8217;s challenges from rivals. 
Sales in the Online Services unit fell short of Thill&#8217;s
prediction. Still, the Bing Internet search engine gained a
point of U.S. market share in the quarter, rising to 12.7
percent, according to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google
had 62.6 percent, followed by 18.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc.,
which is switching over to using Bing&#8217;s technology. 
&#8220;All these threats may not be anywhere near as big as what
they are perceived to be,&#8221; Barnicle said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s perception
that moves the stock.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. is in talks to buy
Playdom Inc., maker of video games played on the Facebook
social-networking website, according to a person with knowledge
of the negotiations. 
An agreement may be reached as soon as the coming week,
said the person, who sought anonymity because a deal hasn&#8217;t been

Wall Street Journal reported yesterday. TechCrunch.com reported
the talks earlier. 
Playdom would extend Disney&#8217;s expansion in online and
mobile games. This month, the company acquired Tapulous Inc., a
developer of music-related games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPod and iPad.
Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, is attracted to the
growth of mobile games and mobile media, Steve Wadsworth, head
of the Internet unit, said in a July 1 interview. 
&#8220;Playdom is the biggest guy left that&#8217;s independent that&#8217;s
not crazy expensive,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, a Los Angeles-based
analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. 
Jonathan Friedland, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. 
Mountain View, California-based Playdom raised $33 million
in June, from venture capital groups including Disney-backed
Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media, consumer and
technology companies. The funding brought the total raised by
the company to $76 million. 
Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney&#8217;s ESPN
sports cable channel in May. 
Disney rose 54 cents to $34.13 today in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 5.8 percent
this year.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest provider of computer services, is
being investigated by the European Union over claims it abused
its dominant position in the market for mainframe computers. 
The probe will review claims IBM linked sales of its
hardware to its software for mainframe computers and that IBM
discriminated against competing sellers of services for the
computers, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a
statement today. IBM said the probe was the result of a campaign
by &#8220;proxies&#8221; of competitors led by Microsoft Corp. 
The commission, the antitrust regulator for the 27-nation
EU, said the probe is partially in response to a complaint by T3
Technologies Inc., which Microsoft invested in. T3 makes
software that transfers mainframe functions to servers that can
run Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system. 
Even as IBM has shifted away from hardware to focus on
software and services, the mainframe has remained of central
importance to the company. Though IBM gets less than 4 percent
of its revenue directly from selling mainframes, the machines
help generate sales of software, services and financing.
Altogether, the contribution is almost a quarter of IBM&#8217;s sales
and 40 percent of its profits, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a report today. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, said in a statement that
&#8220;there is no merit to the claims being made by Microsoft and
its satellite proxies.&#8221; 
Microsoft Probes 
&#8220;Certain IBM competitors which have been unable to win in
the marketplace through investments in fundamental innovations
now want regulators to create for them a market position that
they have not earned,&#8221; IBM said. 
Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, said in an e-mail that the company invests in startup
companies such as T3 to give customers greater choice. The
company isn&#8217;t a party to T3&#8217;s complaint against IBM, he said. 
&#8220;We do share T3&#8217;s belief that there needs to be greater
openness and choice for customers in the mainframe market,&#8221;
Shaw said. &#8220;Customers tell us that they want greater
interoperability between the mainframe and other platforms.&#8221; 
IBM added 3 cents to $128.41 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. Microsoft rose 29 cents to $26.10 in Nasdaq trading in
New York. 
The EU has previously punished U.S. technology companies,
including Microsoft, in antitrust cases. Last year, Intel Corp.
was fined a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.37 billion) and
ordered to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors. 
T3 
Microsoft last year settled an antitrust case with the EU
over its Internet Explorer browser and has previously paid fines
of 1.68 billion euros in EU probes. 
The case was triggered by T3 and another vendor, Turbo
Hercules, and involves IBM&#8217;s alleged tying of mainframe hardware
to its operating system, the commission said. 
T3, a company that builds mainframe computers and is
mentioned in the CCIA&#8217;s report, made a similar complaint against
IBM to the commission. Similar antitrust claims the company made
against IBM in a New York court were dismissed in September. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the commission has taken this
important step,&#8221; said Dave Anderson, a lawyer representing T3. 
The second probe involves complaints of discriminatory
behavior by IBM against competing suppliers of maintenance
services for the computers. 
&#8220;The commission has concerns that IBM may have engaged in
anti-competitive practices with a view to foreclosing the market
for maintenance services,&#8221; the EU today said in a statement,
&#8220;in particular by restricting or delaying access to spare parts
for which IBM is the only source.&#8221; 
Newest Mainframe 
IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies to offer the systems.
The company announced its newest mainframe, the zEnterprise,
last week. The model, up to 60 percent faster than its
predecessor, uses IBM software to integrate it with smaller
server computers. 
The company comes out with a new mainframe every two to
three years. After the introduction of the last five models,
sales in its services division, more than half its total
revenue, rose an average of 3 percent, Deutsche Bank analyst
Chris Whitmore wrote in a report. Excluding the 2008 update,
which came during a recession, the boost is 9 percent. 
The mainframe, along with services and software growth,
will help IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a
currency impact, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said
this month. Last week, IBM reported second-quarter sales that
climbed 2 percent to $23.7 billion, with a $500 million hit from
currency.

General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, plans to sell its Chevrolet Volt electric car for
about $40,000, said a person familiar with the plans. 
Pricing and ordering details for the car will be announced
tomorrow at 12 p.m. New York time by Joel Ewanick, vice
president of U.S. marketing, at a news conference in San Jose,
California, GM said today on its website. 
At just over $40,000, the Volt will sell for a premium over
Nissan Motor Co.&#8217;s Leaf all-electric car, which is scheduled to
go on sale in November for $32,780. GM is making the pitch that
the Volt&#8217;s longer driving range on a single charge and tank of
gasoline will make it a better buy for most drivers than
Nissan&#8217;s Leaf, said Jim Hall, principal of 2953 Analytics Inc. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a duel of being ultragreen versus having better
driving range,&#8221; said Hall, whose consulting firm is based in
Birmingham, Michigan. &#8220;A hard-core green consumer will be
willing to live with the Leaf&#8217;s range. For others, the Volt wins
because there are many buyers worried about range.&#8221; 
Dave Darovitz, a GM spokesman, declined to comment. 
The Volt can travel 340 miles on a tank of fuel, with the
first 40 in electric drive before a gasoline engine starts to
recharge the battery. The Leaf uses no fuel and can travel about
100 miles on a charge. 
GM wouldn&#8217;t give specific pricing for the car. Retired GM
Vice Chairman Bob Lutz told talk show host David Letterman in
May 2009 that the company was targeting a $40,000 sale price. 
Sales Markets 
The Volt will initially be sold this year in parts of
Texas, New York, California and Washington, D.C. Next year, GM
will build 10,000 of the cars. 
The company has said the Volt will get 230 mpg. The
official rating may be different than that figure, Tom Stephens,
Detroit-based GM&#8217;s vice chairman of global product operations,
said earlier this month. 
Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn has said he
plans to sell 500,000 electric cars annually worldwide by 2012.
Both cars will be eligible for U.S. government subsidies of
$7,500.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, appointed Steven J. Douglas
as executive vice president and chief financial officer,
effective immediately. 
Douglas succeeds Ed Hoyt, who has been the company&#8217;s
interim CFO since 2008, Chicago-based General Growth said in a
statement today. Douglas was previously president of Brookfield
Properties Corp., the owner of Canada&#8217;s tallest skyscraper and
New York&#8217;s World Financial Center. 
&#8220;We are extremely pleased to welcome Steve to our
management team,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Adam Metz said in the

make him well qualified to lead GGP&#8217;s finance operations as we
enter a new stage in the company&#8217;s history.&#8221; 
General Growth began the largest real-estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The company
had amassed a $27 billion debt load while making acquisitions.
Its exit from bankruptcy is being financed by companies
including Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which is Brookfield
Properties&#8217; principal shareholder. 
Douglas will be paid an annual salary of $650,000, General
Growth said in a regulatory filing.

Chevron Corp. expects its Wheatstone
gas project in Australia to gain environmental approval in the
first quarter of 2011, allowing the second-largest U.S. energy
producer to start construction in the second half of next year. 
The liquefied natural gas venture may have as many as six
processing units and produce as much as 25 million metric tons
of the fuel a year, Chevron Australia said in an environmental
review filed on its website today. Each Wheatstone unit will be
capable of producing 4 million to 7 million tons annually. 
Chevron aims to make a decision to proceed with Wheatstone
in the middle of next year, a development timeline shows. The
Wheatstone and Gorgon projects, among more than a dozen proposed
LNG ventures in Australia targeting an increase in Asian demand
for cleaner-burning fuel, are &#8220;centerpieces&#8221; of Chevron&#8217;s
global growth plans, the company says on its local website. 
&#8220;The Wheatstone project is set to be one of Australia&#8217;s
largest resources projects,&#8221; generating about A$20 billion ($18
billion) in government revenue, Chevron Australia said in
comments e-mailed by Perth-based spokesman Guy Houston. The
company has yet to provide a cost estimate for the venture. 
The A$43 billion Gorgon project, which Chevron says is
Australia&#8217;s largest resources development, is due to begin LNG
exports in 2014 from a three-unit, 15 million ton-a-year
facility and may add a fourth and fifth processing unit. 
Korea Gas Corp., the world&#8217;s largest importer of LNG,
signed an initial accord this month to buy 1.5 million tons of
the fuel a year from Wheatstone and to acquire a 5 percent stake
in the venture, which will have processing facilities near the
town of Onslow, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of Perth.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to take 4.1 million tons of LNG a
year from Wheatstone, under a deal announced in December. 
Wheatstone will include a domestic gas plant that will have
a capacity equal to about 15 percent of LNG sales, Chevron said
in the documents today. The project may employ 3,000 workers at
the peak of construction in 2014 and generate 6,500 &#8220;direct and
indirect&#8221; jobs while it is being built, the company said. First
LNG shipments are planned for 2016, according to Chevron. 
The project needs environmental approvals from both the
Australian and Western Australian state governments.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it&#8217;s
still &#8220;fundamentally positive&#8221; on China&#8217;s yuan-denominated
stocks even after a surge in the CSI 300 Index, given their
valuations and the emergence of several &#8220;catalysts.&#8221; 
The Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese insurers are a
&#8220;convenient, yet fundamentally appealing, way&#8221; for foreign
investors to gain access to the A-share market, Goldman Sachs
analysts led by Kinger Lau and Timothy Moe said in a report. 
&#8220;We stay fundamentally positive on A shares,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;Although we do not expect policy to ease
immediately, we believe any further positive development on this
front can re-rate the market further.&#8221; 
The CSI 300, tracking yuan-denominated shares on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, has surged 12 percent since
this year&#8217;s low set on July 5, on speculation cooling economic
growth and property-price gains will spur the government to ease
its policy tightening. Chinese stocks are still the worst
performers in Asia this year, with the CSI 300 and the Shanghai
Composite Index both slumping 22 percent. 
Even after the gains, A shares are trading at 13 times
estimated profits with per-share earnings growth of 29 percent
in 2010 and 22 percent in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs
estimates. 
&#8220;The low valuations have already discounted a pessimistic
macro/micro growth scenario and several catalysts are emerging,
including receding concerns over liquidity drain and potential
normalization of investors&#8217; positioning,&#8221; the analysts wrote in
today&#8217;s report. 
&#8216;Stable&#8217; Policies 
The CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent to 2,778.68 at the 11:30 a.m.
break, snapping a five-day, 6.8 percent rally. The Shanghai
Composite lost 0.4 percent following last week&#8217;s 6.1 percent
advance. 
Premier Wen Jiabao last week said in comments published by
Xinhua News Agency on a government website that stable policies
should be the main theme in the second half. He also highlighted
the importance of expanding domestic demand, saying that China
would &#8220;improve&#8221; stimulus measures for boosting consumption. 
China&#8217;s economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from an 11.9 percent increase in the January to
March period, prompting economists from Morgan Stanley to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to cut their gross domestic product
forecasts for this year. Data released this month also showed
property prices in 70 Chinese cities fell 0.1 percent in June
from the previous month and banking lending cooled last month. 
Monetary Easing 
The recent stock-market gains represent a &#8220;tradable
rebound, not yet a reversal,&#8221; driven by speculation about an
easing in mortgage policy, lower-than-expected inflation and the
completion of stress test for European banks, according to China
International Capital Corp. 
Still, &#8220;with GDP growth of 10.3 percent and lower-than-
expected inflation, property prices showing few signs of giving
back, and labor shortages in some regions, it is difficult to
convincingly argue for a general monetary easing,&#8221; CICC
analysts Hao Hong and Mei He said in a report today. 
The Goldman Sachs analysts said they favored China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co. for its &#8220;above-peer&#8221; new business value
growth potential and China Life Insurance Co., the nation&#8217;s
largest insurer, for its investments in A shares. China Pacific
has climbed 0.5 percent in Hong Kong trading this year while
China Life has dropped 10 percent. 
The H shares of insurers have had a &#8220;high directional
correlation&#8221; and this relationship is likely to remain in the
near term give their holdings of A shares, according to the
analysts. They also said the industry&#8217;s &#8220;fundamentals remain
strong,&#8221; with premiums growing at 34 percent in the first half
and long-term growth prospects looking &#8220;promising.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. agreed to buy
Playdom Inc. for $563.2 million, acquiring the second-biggest
maker of games played on Facebook and MySpace websites. 
Playdom&#8217;s owners may receive an additional $200 million if
performance goals are met, Burbank, California-based Disney, the
world&#8217;s largest media company, said today in a statement. 
The purchase extends Disney&#8217;s drive into online and mobile
games. This month, the company bought Tapulous Inc., a developer
of music-related games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPod and iPad. Playdom
has the talent Disney needs to expand in social media, Chief
Executive Officer Bob Iger said in an interview. 
&#8220;I want to be bold and aggressive,&#8221; Iger said. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t get the kind of growth that we want by building from the
inside.&#8221; 
Disney plans to make more acquisitions, Iger said, without
being specific. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t intend to stand still as we migrate this
company&#8217;s great wealth of content to new technology,&#8221; he said. 
Playdom, based in Mountain View, California, raised $33
million in June from venture capital groups including Disney-
backed Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media,
consumer and technology companies. The funding brought the total
raised by the closely held company to $76 million. 
Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney&#8217;s ESPN
sports cable channel in May. 
Disney fell 12 cents to $34.28 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 6.3
percent this year.

A form of Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s erection
drug Viagra, sold as the blood-pressure treatment called Revatio
in adults, may be used for children with a rare lung disorder if
U.S. regulators can agree on how to test it. 
The condition, called pulmonary arterial hypertension,
affects only 600 children a year, New York-based Pfizer said. It
causes high blood pressure in arteries in the lungs, making the
right side of the heart work harder than normal and causing
chest pain, dizziness and fatigue. Outside advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration are set to meet July 29 to evaluate
whether Pfizer&#8217;s study of Revatio is sufficient to determine its
effectiveness in children, the agency said today. 
The FDA in 2001 asked Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, to study the medicine in children with the lung
disorder. If the New York-based company meets the FDA study
requirements, the drug would get an extra six months on the
market without generic competition. Patents on the drug, with
2009 sales of $1.89 billion as Viagra and $450 million as
Revatio, are expected to expire in 2012. Some doctors are
already using the treatment in kids with the lung condition. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good option in pediatric patients because it is
well-tolerated, in that it doesn&#8217;t have as many side effects as
some of the other options,&#8221; said Chad Knoderer, a pediatric
clinical pharmacist at Riley Hospital for Children in
Indianapolis, who has used Viagra in kids with the disorder.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. halted a short
position on the pound after Britain&#8217;s currency broke above
April&#8217;s high. 
&#8220;While the near-term setup argues for some pause, today&#8217;s
upside break suggests an increased risk for additional upside,&#8221;
Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst in New York at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, wrote in a research note today. 
The pound rallied 0.5 percent to $1.5569 after earlier
advancing as much as 0.6 percent to $1.5578, the highest level
since Feb. 18. Sterling traded above the 200-day moving average
for the first time since Jan. 28, according to Bloomberg data.
The pound broke the April high of $1.5526, according to
JPMorgan. 
The pound may dip to support of $1.5385 before advancing to
a range of $1.5750 and $1.5865, O&#8217;Connor wrote. 
In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A support level is an area on a
chart where orders to buy a currency versus a counterpart may be
placed, potentially blocking a decline. A short position is a
bet a security will drop.

the only major U.S. broadcaster whose total audience declined
last season, and it&#8217;s also down among viewers aged 18 to 49, a
group sought by advertisers, according to Nielsen Co. 
&#8220;McPherson has had a couple of bad seasons,&#8221; Brad Adgate,
director of research at New York-based advertising firm Horizon
Media Inc, said in an interview. &#8220;He never got his footing back
after the writers&#8217; strike.&#8221; 
The three-month walkout by the Writers Guild of America
that ended in February 2008 idled scripted shows including
&#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; effectively
curtailing the 2007-2008 television season. 
Paul Lee, head of the ABC Family cable channel, is
replacing McPherson, the Hollywood Reporter said, citing unnamed
company insiders. No one has been hired yet,     ABC spokesman Kevin Brockman said in an e-mail. 
In a statement from his publicist, McPherson said he would
announce plans that include an &#8220;entrepreneurial venture in the
spirits business&#8221; and an &#8220;involvement in a new media
company.&#8221; 
The timing of the change is awkward for Disney, Adgate
said. TV networks are meeting this week with critics in Beverly
Hills, California, to preview their schedules for the season
that starts in September. ABC plans to make its presentation on
Aug. 1. 
Comedy Block 
Third among TV networks in prime-time audience, ABC plans
to air new shows including &#8220;Body of Proof&#8221; starring Dana Delany and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; about a mock-documentary crew that
follows around homicide detectives. The network also picked up
the comedy &#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as manager
of a San Diego sports arena. 
McPherson established a block of comedy shows last TV
season on Wednesday nights that includes three returning
programs: &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; 
The network sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the
season that starts in September for its full-day schedule, with
average prime-time rates rising 8 percent to 9 percent, a person
with knowledge of the matter said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent
to 80 percent of its inventory, the person said. 
By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. 
&#8216;High-Pressure Job&#8217; 
&#8220;This is a high pressure job where you get results the
next day and millions of dollars are riding on the programming
decisions you make,&#8221; Adgate said. &#8220;This is historically a very
short-lived position. You&#8217;re always in a pressure-cooker.&#8221; 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 12 cents to
$34.28 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 6.3 percent this year. 
Unlike its rivals, ABC doesn&#8217;t carry National Football
League games, which provide some of TV&#8217;s biggest audiences and a
platform to promote new shows, Adgate said. Monday Night
Football airs on Disney&#8217;s ESPN cable network. 
Without football, ABC relies more on entertainment programs
for ratings, Adgate said. 
&#8220;Sporting events have been on an upswing compared with
entertainment shows,&#8221; Adgate said. &#8220;That&#8217;s partly why ESPN is
the crown jewel of television at Disney, not ABC.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said tablet computers are high on his
priority list as Apple Inc. takes the lead in a market his
company has tried to foster for more than a decade. 
&#8220;Today, one of the top issues on my mind is &#8216;hey there&#8217;s a
category we have had Windows on for a long time and Apple&#8217;s done
an interesting job of putting together a synthesis and putting a
product out,&#8217;&#8221; Ballmer said today at Microsoft&#8217;s annual analyst
meeting at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. 
Tablets based on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system have
struggled since their initial release in 2002. Apple, based in
Cupertino, California, sold 3.27 million iPads last quarter,
outselling all comparable computers. The device debuted April 3. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re coming. We&#8217;re coming full guns,&#8221; Ballmer said. 
Ballmer said the company is working with hardware partners
to produce compelling tablet computers and will be aided by the
release early next year of a new Intel Corp. chip, code-named
Oak Trail. 
Oak Trail is a dual-core version of Intel&#8217;s Atom chip for
tablets. It will improve battery life by using half the power
while offering enough processing to provide smooth video and
fast Web surfing. 
&#8216;Foreseeable Future&#8217; 
Microsoft signed an expanded licensing agreement last week
with ARM Holdings Plc, whose chip designs are used in Apple&#8217;s
iPad. While the new accord could allow Microsoft to expand the
use of ARM chips in Windows 7-based tablets, Ballmer said the
machines would be based on Intel architecture for the
&#8220;foreseeable future.&#8221; 
Over the longer-term, Ballmer said Microsoft would &#8220;embrace
what we need to over time in terms of hardware.&#8221; 
Microsoft rose 8 cents to $26.03 at 4 p.m. New York time on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 15 percent
this year. 
Ballmer said he was less worried about competition in
tablets from Google Inc.&#8217;s Android and Chrome operating systems. 
&#8220;Bring it, we relish the competition,&#8221; he said of Google&#8217;s
efforts in tablet operating systems. &#8220;If we can&#8217;t compete with
whatever the weird collection of Android machines is going to
look like, shame on us.&#8221; 
Ballmer also commented on Microsoft&#8217;s mobile operating
system, Windows Phone 7, which is due on phones later this year.
Asked what he would do if the program is another Vista, a
reference to the poorly received version of Windows, Ballmer
replied &#8220;it won&#8217;t be.&#8221; 
Separately, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
Microsoft&#8217;s board will address the subjects of dividends and
share buybacks at its fall board meeting, as it typically does. 
Bloomberg data suggests Microsoft may announce an increase
in its quarterly dividend in September to 15 cents a share from
13 cents.

Exxon Mobil Corp. posted its biggest
profit increase since 2003, exceeding analysts&#8217; estimates, as
rising production helped the largest U.S. oil company take
advantage of gains in energy prices. 
Second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion, or $1.60 a share, from $3.95 billion, or 81 cents, a
year earlier, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said today in a
statement. Per-share profit was 15 cents higher than the average
of 17 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest energy
company, capitalized on jumps in oil and fuel prices by boosting
production. Exxon&#8217;s output climbed 8.4 percent to the equivalent
of 4 million barrels of oil a day. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson ramped up capital spending to more than $70 million a
day since 2008, ending a slide that left production at the
lowest level since the 1999 acquisition of Mobil Corp. 
&#8220;The law of large numbers says the bigger you are, the
harder it is to grow,&#8221; said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus
Research in New York who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Exxon shares
and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;If they can deliver higher production,
that&#8217;s a big plus because that means that they&#8217;re going to be
delivering more income and cash flow.&#8221;

An unbeaten 213-run stand from Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood lifted England to 331-4 on the
opening day of the first cricket Test against Pakistan. 
England, which won the toss and elected to bat, slumped to
118-4 at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Morgan was on 125 at
stumps, recording his first Test century with a six in the 80th
over. Collingwood is 81 not out. 
England captain Andrew Strauss scored 45 before edging to
Kamran Akmal off Mohammad Aamer as the host reached 103-2 at
lunch. Aamer was 2-28 in the morning session. 
Pakistan responded after the break as Mohammad Asif bowled
out Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott was out leg-before-wicket
against Aamer four balls later. 
Morgan and Collingwood then took over as England reached
190-4 at tea. Morgan was ruled out lbw on 78 in the 73rd over
but the call was overturned on review, allowing him to reach the
century mark seven overs later.

India&#8217;s National Commodity 
Derivatives Exchange Ltd., partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., is considering taking an anchor investor, Chief Executive
Officer R. Ramaseshan said. 
&#8220;We are keeping that option open and we are actively
looking at what could be the contribution of an anchor
investor,&#8221; he said in an interview in Mumbai yesterday.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing conclusive at this point in time.&#8221; 
Buying a stake in a commodity bourse in India, the top user
of gold and the second-biggest grower of wheat and rice, will
let an investor tap a market where turnover is forecast by the
industry regulator to rise 20 percent in the year to March 31
from 77.65 trillion rupees ($1.7 trillion) a year earlier. NYSE
Euronext, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Fidelity
International are among holders in the Multi Commodity Exchange
of India Ltd., the nation&#8217;s largest such exchange. 
Jaypee Capital Services Ltd., a financial services company
in New Delhi, is considering acquiring a stake, Ramaseshan said,
adding that the exchange isn&#8217;t necessarily talking with Jaypee
about it being an anchor investor. 
&#8220;That issue is wide open at this point of time,&#8221; he said. 
Jaypee Managing Director Gaurav Arora confirmed talks with
the exchange by phone from Delhi. He declined to provide details. 
Turnover on commodity bourses in India jumped 57 percent to
24.6 trillion rupees in the quarter ended June 30, the regulator
Forward Markets Commission said on its website July 7. 
The National Commodity  Derivatives Exchange had a daily
average turnover of 27 billion rupees in the three months ended
June, up from 22 billion rupees a year ago, Ramaseshan said. 
Stakeholders 
Goldman Sachs, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and Shree
Renuka Sugars Ltd., India&#8217;s biggest refiner, each hold a 4
percent stake in NCDEX, according to the exchange&#8217;s website. 
Indian rules allows an anchor investor to hold as much as
26 percent in a commodity exchange. Ownership by foreign funds
has been capped at 5 percent for a single investor. 
The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd., which holds 15
percent in the National Commodity exchange, needs to lower the
stake to 5 percent by the year end, according to amended rules
published this month by the regulator. 
&#8220;The National Stock Exchange as a shareholder will have to
take a call on how they will go about it,&#8221; said Ramaseshan. &#8220;
NCDEX as an exchange is watched by others, so I am sure there
should be interest,&#8221; in the stake, he said. 
Life Insurance Corp. of India and the National Bank for
Agriculture and Rural Development each own 15 percent of NCDEX.
Crisil Ltd., a unit of Standard  Poor&#8217;s, and Indian Farmers
Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd., each hold 12 percent, according to
the exchange&#8217;s website.

Four years ago, Bob Iger, the chief
executive officer of Walt Disney Co., tried to build a cell-
phone business. Disney created a family-oriented service that
included global positioning so parents could track their kids. 
Too few consumers signed up, and the company killed the
operation after 15 months. Disney Interactive, the division that
ran the ill-fated cell service, is still unprofitable. It lost
$55 million last quarter. 
Iger retains his enthusiasm for digital business and has
switched strategies to buying rather than building. He wants to
acquire social games and other online services that come with
customers and talented creators and that will help sell Disney&#8217;s
famous brands. 
&#8220;You don&#8217;t get the kind of growth we want by building from
the inside,&#8221; he said in an interview in Bloomberg Businessweek&#8217;s
Aug. 2 edition. 
Since paying $350 million for the kids&#8217; social network Club
Penguin three years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games,
whose founder helped create Microsoft&#8217;s hit &#8220;Halo&#8221; franchise.
Early this month, the entertainment giant acquired Tapulous, a
publisher of music-related games for Apple&#8217;s iPhone. 
Disney made its biggest video game bet yet on July 27,
agreeing to pay $563 million for closely held Playdom, the
Mountain View, California-based maker of &#8220;Sorority Life&#8221; and
&#8220;Mobsters,&#8221; which are played on Facebook, MySpace and mobile
phones. If Playdom meets performance targets over time, its
founders and investors may receive an additional $200 million. 
Fast-Growing Venue 
Playdom specializes in games that sell virtual goods. In
&#8220;Mobsters,&#8221; players try to build crime syndicates by buying
with real money digital machine guns and henchmen. In &#8220;Sorority
Life,&#8221; players purchase clothing and accessories as they climb
a social ladder. Some 42 million people regularly play Playdom&#8217;s
games each month, according to Disney. 
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in
Los Angeles, said Playdom will give Disney a potentially fast-
growing venue to sell Disney characters and media brands from
Mickey Mouse to Spider-Man to ESPN. When the Pixar movie &#8220;Cars
2&#8221; is released next June, promotions might include the
soundtrack in a Tapulous-made music game for mobile phones and
the characters woven into Playdom games on Facebook. 
Disney said it plans to launch a virtual world based on
&#8220;Cars&#8221; next month. That would be in addition to more
traditional product tie-ins such as plush-toy merchandise, games
for Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii console, coverage on ABC and the Disney
Channel, and theme-park rides. 
Looking for Knowhow 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re looking for Playdom&#8217;s revenue as
much as they&#8217;re looking for Playdom&#8217;s knowhow&#8221; in working
social games into the Disney mix, Pachter said. 
Playdom CEO John Pleasants is moving to Disney, where he
will continue to oversee social-game development and become an
executive vice-president. He will work with Iger&#8217;s point-man for
digital strategy, Steve Wadsworth, who has run Disney&#8217;s Internet
unit since 1999 and assumed video-game oversight in 2008. 
Iger said the buy-don&#8217;t-build approach is what drove some
earlier acquisitions. His $8.1 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006
buttressed Disney&#8217;s flagging animation division. The
$4.2 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment last year gave
the company, better known for cartoon princesses than
superheroes, iconic comic-book characters that appeal to boys. 
Club Penguin was its first acquisition of a virtual world.
The site&#8217;s founders run online worlds with monthly subscription
fees and sales of virtual goods. They built the &#8220;Cars&#8221; site
that will launch next month and are overseeing older ones such
as &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean.&#8221; 
Talent on Board 
Iger has some Internet talent on his board to lean on as he
makes digital deals. Apple CEO Steve Jobs joined as a result of
the Pixar acquisition and is Disney&#8217;s largest shareholder.
Disney was the first to sell TV programs and films on Apple&#8217;s
iTunes online media store. 
Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was tapped
in March to become a director. Disney has since increased its
presence on the social network and experimented with using it to
sell tickets to the Pixar movie &#8220;Toy Story 3.&#8221; 
Big media companies typically lose money online. News
Corp.&#8217;s digital media unit lost $150 million in the quarter
ended in March. CBS Corp. stopped breaking out results for
interactive after that unit lost $41.3 million in the first nine
months of 2009. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s the right strategy for Disney to buy,&#8221; says Gina Bianchini, a venture capitalist who co-founded the social
network Ning.com with Marc Andreessen. &#8220;And they are looking at
some very savvy acquisitions.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, didn&#8217;t want to take any chances when rules requiring
screening of all U.S. air cargo take effect next week. Neither
did Racine Berkow Associates, a shipper of fine art. 
Both are among 873 companies that as of last week had
joined a federal program qualifying them to screen their own
goods for air shipping instead of relying on airlines or
freight-handling companies. 
The rule taking effect Aug. 1 requires checking for
explosives all 4.2 billion pounds of freight shipped on
passenger planes annually within the U.S., plus goods loaded
onto flights headed for international destinations. The
Transportation Security Administration estimates the anti-
terrorist screening may cost $2.8 billion over 10 years.
Carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. are charging extra to
customers who leave screening to them. 
&#8220;Delays alone could hurt our product,&#8221; Brad Elrod,
Pfizer&#8217;s director of global conveyance security, said in an
interview. &#8220;It could be sitting in non-temperature-controlled
environments. If you open it up to inspect it, you ruin the
product.&#8221; 
It &#8220;became a very simple choice&#8221; for New York-based
Pfizer to seek certification to do its own pre-flight
inspections under the TSA&#8217;s program, Elrod said. 
The inspection requirement, championed by Representative
Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, was part of a 2007 law in
response to the Sept. 11 attacks. All freight going into the
belly of a plane should be checked for explosives just as all
passengers must clear security checkpoints, Markey said. 
Delays, Confusion 
Companies expect delays and confusion as airlines and
customers struggle to meet the 100 percent inspection standard,
up from a requirement of 75 percent that took effect in May,
said Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders
Association. 
&#8220;There will be some spotted areas of hardship which might
take a few days to resolve,&#8221; Fried said. Members of his
Washington-based organization include Swiss freight forwarders
Kuehne + Nagel International AG and Panalpina Welttransport
Holding AG. 
Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare
International Airport and New York&#8217;s John F. Kennedy
International Airport are among the 18 largest gateways where
cargo may back up after the deadline, Doug Brittin, the TSA&#8217;s
general manager for air cargo security, said in an interview. 
AMR Corp.&#8217;s American Airlines, which spent $10 million to
comply, is screening about half the cargo it ships, with the
remainder arriving at the airport already screened, said Dave Brooks, president of the airline&#8217;s cargo unit. The Fort Worth,
Texas-based company&#8217;s cargo division generated 11 percent of its
revenue in the second quarter. 
Rapiscan, Smiths 
American bought seven machines, from London-based Smiths
Group Plc and OSI Systems Inc.&#8217;s Rapiscan unit in Hawthorne,
California, that are capable of screening shrink-wrapped
pallets. Each machine costs about $300,000, Brooks said. 
Rapiscan and Smiths, the world&#8217;s biggest manufacturers of
airport scanners, make the only two machines certified by the
U.S. to inspect cargo shipped on pallets. TSA-approved air cargo
inspection is Rapiscan&#8217;s &#8220;largest-growing business and has been
for the last year,&#8221; said Peter Kant, the company&#8217;s executive
vice president, without disclosing sales. 
Racine Berkow, whose Long Island City, New York, company
ships fine art, antiques and museum exhibitions, said she is
worried her fragile and valuable goods may be damaged even
though she met the TSA standards for self-certification. 
Risk of Damage 
&#8220;This whole thing has been a nightmare,&#8221; Berkow said in
an interview. &#8220;For my cargo, it&#8217;s going to increase the risk of
handling and possibly increase the risk of damage.&#8221; 
Companies such as Berkow&#8217;s didn&#8217;t have to buy screening
machines. They won TSA certification by training employees in
security procedures and verifying that goods are secure from
packing to airport delivery. The companies attach special
package seals that speed cargo past airport screening. 
Cargo backups next month will be more likely when airlines
are doing the screening at the airport, Brooks of American
Airlines said. 
&#8220;We will see, probably at a major airport, some cargo get
left behind just because of a miscommunication or a spike in
activity that we weren&#8217;t anticipating,&#8221; Brooks said in an
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to see the supply chain come to a
screeching halt.&#8221; 
Program&#8217;s Costs 
The TSA estimates it will pick up a fourth of the costs of
the screening program, with companies bearing the rest. Agency
officials have said they will miss an Aug. 1 deadline for
screening cargo arriving on passenger planes from overseas for
transfer onto domestic flights. 
Delta carried the most cargo among U.S. passenger airlines
last year with 2.29 billion ton miles, an industry measurement
of one ton of cargo carried one mile. About 4 percent consisted
of U.S. mail. Cargo volume fell 20 percent last year from 2008
after the world&#8217;s largest carrier idled the last of its Boeing
Co. 777 freighters because they were becoming too costly to
operate. It now moves freight only on passenger planes. 
The airline bought screening machines for major hubs and
gateway cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles and Seattle, and
expanded its cargo staff to offer screening under the rule, said
Anthony Black, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta. 
Fee Doubled 
Delta more than doubled a cargo-screening fee, to 12 cents
per kilogram from 5 cents, to cover costs for new equipment, the
carrier said in a May letter to freight customers. Customers
that deliver cargo already screened don&#8217;t pay the fees. 
Even with extra costs, it is usually cheaper to ship air
cargo on passenger planes than on air freighters, which may cost
three to four times as much, according to Fried of the
Airforwarders Association. 
FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., the largest U.S.
air-freight carriers, are exempt from the inspection
requirements because they fly planes without passengers.

Imperial Oil Ltd., Exxon Mobil Corp.
and BP Plc formed a joint venture to explore for oil and natural
gas in Canada&#8217;s Beaufort Sea. 
Imperial and Exxon will each hold a 25 percent stake in the
venture, and BP will own 50 percent, Imperial spokesman Pius Rolheiser said by phone from Calgary today. 
The two licenses involved are exploration license 446,
bought by Imperial and Exxon in 2007, and exploration license
449, awarded to London-based BP in 2008, Rolheiser said. 
Exxon Mobil and other producers have discovered more than
10 billion barrels of oil in North American arctic seas. The
reserves remain locked beneath the seafloor because of a lack of
pipeline capacity to ship them to markets.

Morgan Stanley, which last week
reported higher equity trading revenue than its five biggest
competitors, hired Peter Santoro as co-head of U.S. equities
trading. 
Santoro will run the group with Tony Lauto, who joined the
firm from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in February, according to an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Morgan Stanley
spokesman Mark Lake confirmed the contents of the memo. The New
York-based firm also named John Neary global head of portfolio
products. 
Morgan Stanley beat earnings estimates last week as equity
trading revenue jumped 82 percent from a year earlier. Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman has added employees to Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s sales and trading unit to close a gap with larger
competitors including Goldman Sachs. 
Santoro was head of institutional markets at Citadel
Investment Group LLC until December. He previously was global
head of equity trading at Citigroup Inc. and CEO of Knight
Financial Products, according to the memo, which was sent by Ted Pick, global co-head of equities, and Sam Kellie-Smith, global
head of trading. 
Neary will also represent the equities division on the
investment bank&#8217;s Financial Reform Steering Committee, which
will help the firm adapt to new rules required by the law
President Barack Obama signed earlier this month, according to
the memo. The law boosts oversight of derivatives trading and
puts limits on proprietary trading and banks&#8217; investments in
private-equity and hedge funds. 
Equities trading generated $2.8 billion of net revenue in
the first six months of this year. That almost matches the $3.4
billion in all of 2009, when the division bore $1.7 billion in
losses related to an improvement in the firm&#8217;s own credit
spreads.

Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, said profit tripled, exceeding analysts&#8217;
estimates, after recovering demand for petroleum-based fuels
lifted energy prices. 
Second-quarter net income jumped to $5.41 billion, or $2.70
a share, from $1.75 billion, or 87 cents, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a statement. Per-
share profit was 24 cents higher than the average of 18
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chevron follows Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips in
reporting surges in earnings this week after recovering
economies around the world boosted demand for diesel and other
fuels. Refining earnings at Chevron jumped more than sevenfold
to $975 million. U.S. oil futures averaged $78.05 a barrel in
the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a common theme this quarter of riding higher
commodity prices and improved refining and chemical margins,&#8221;
said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis
who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Chevron shares and doesn&#8217;t own any.
&#8220;I think the company continues to have a good outlook going
forward.&#8221; 
Revenue climbed 32 percent to $53 billion, Chevron said.
Oil and natural-gas production rose 2.8 percent to the
equivalent of 2.75 million barrels of crude a day. 
Worldwide demand for oil in the second quarter increased an
estimated 3.2 percent from a year earlier, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Shares Rise 
Chevron rose 19 cents to $76.21 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has
18 buy and 8 hold ratings from analysts, has climbed 13 percent
in the past year. 
Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson aims to boost
oil and gas production with wells in places such as the Gulf of
Mexico and Australia. The industry is coping with a moratorium
on new deep-water drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf following an
explosion April 20 at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well, which killed 11
workers and caused the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. 
Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil company, said yesterday
that its second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion. ConocoPhillips, the No. 3 U.S. energy producer, said
July 28 that its profit jumped almost fivefold to $4.16 billion.

Walt Disney Co. named Paul Lee
president of the ABC Entertainment Group, replacing Steve McPherson, who resigned unexpectedly this week. 
Lee will oversee the ABC Studios and supervise scheduling,
marketing and programming, Burbank, California-based Disney said
today in a statement. A replacement for him at ABC Family, the
cable channel where he was president, will be made in the near
future, Disney said. 
The change comes as the networks promote their slates to
critics at meetings in Beverly Hills, California, ahead of the
TV season that starts in September. ABC presents its lineup on
Aug. 1. Anne Sweeney, president of ABC Television Group, cited
Lee&#8217;s creative instincts and ability to develop programming that
resonates with audiences. 
&#8220;Paul&#8217;s success at ABC Family is as amazing as it is
indisputable,&#8221; Sweeney said in the statement. 
ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. 
McPherson, in a statement from his publicist, said he would
announce plans that include an &#8220;entrepreneurial venture in the
spirits business&#8221; and &#8220;involvement in a new media company.&#8221; 
Third among TV networks in prime-time audience, ABC plans
to air new shows including &#8220;Body of Proof&#8221; starring Dana Delany and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; about a mock-documentary crew that
follows around homicide detectives. The network also picked up
the comedy &#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as manager
of a San Diego sports arena. 
Comedy Block 
McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
&#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; 
The network sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new
season for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates
rising 8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the
matter said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. 
By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year.

Walt Disney Co. agreed to sell
Miramax to investors including Ronald Tutor and private equity
firm Colony Capital LLC for more than $660 million, ending a
six-month search to find a buyer for the art-house moviemaker. 
The sale to Filmyard Holding LLC, backed by partners
including construction executive Tutor and Colony, is expected
to be completed by the end of the year, Burbank, California-
based Disney said today in a statement. Disney, the world&#8217;s
largest media company, began winding down Miramax, founded by
brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein, last October. 
&#8220;The sale fits into a much wider logic with studios
reviewing where they can save money by selling some parts of the
business or bringing down budgets for film and reviewing and
redoing actor deals,&#8221; said David Hancock, head of the cinema
market at researcher Screen Digest in London. 
Miramax, with rights to more than 700 titles including
Academy Award winners such as &#8220;Chicago&#8221; and &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; was one of several film assets on the block. Liberty
Media Corp. agreed to sell its Overture unit to Relativity Media
LLC last week. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is seeking buyers after
falling behind on $3.7 billion of debt. 
&#8220;Our current strategy for Walt Disney Studios is to focus
on the development of great motion pictures under the Disney,
Pixar and Marvel brands,&#8221; President and Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in the statement. 
Disney fell 11 cents to $33.60 at 12:24 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 4.5
percent this year before today. 
The Buyers 
Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California
based Tutor Perini Corp., began negotiations for Miramax after
Disney ended talks with Los Angeles investor Ron Burkle and the
Weinsteins, who were working on a $625 million offer, people
with knowledge of the situation said earlier this month. 
&#8220;The new buyers can&#8217;t just mine Miramax&#8217;s existing catalog
so they must have some plans for future production,&#8221; Hancock
said. &#8220;With DVD sales declining and video-on-demand not
contributing as much as was hoped, the value of catalogs have
gone down.&#8221; 
Miramax&#8217;s top-grossing film was 2002&#8217;s &#8220;Chicago,&#8221; taking
in about $171 million, followed by 2000&#8217;s &#8220;Scary Movie&#8221; with
$157 million and &#8220;Good Will Hunting&#8221; with $138 million,
according to figures from U.S. researcher Box Office Mojo. 
The Weinsteins sold Miramax, named after their parents
Miriam and Max, to Disney in 1993. The two, who left in 2005,
control rights to some films and are acquainted with both Tutor
and Barrack, according to one of the people. Disney had been
seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax.

In a small, windowless room in the
basement of International Business Machines Corp.&#8217;s Almaden lab
in Silicon Valley, Dharmendra Modha is building a simulated
monkey brain using images projected on flat-screen TVs. 
Modha, the lab&#8217;s manager of cognitive computing, urged Big
Blue to back his pet project, which combines advances in
nanotechnology, supercomputing and neuroscience. If successful,
the effort could help computers &#8220;think&#8221; like the human mind. 
IBM green-lights proposals from Modha and other researchers
at the San Jose, California, facility because some of the
gambles can spawn significant business. Since the 1990s, lab
advances in how data is stored, managed and analyzed have helped
generate millions of dollars in sales. Yet even lab directors
concede chances are slim that any one breakthrough will make a
sizable addition to IBM&#8217;s almost $100 billion in annual revenue. 
&#8220;We have no way of making money off of this -- unless a
miracle happens and we figure out how to make better
computers,&#8221; said Laura Haas, director of computer science at
Almaden and the lab&#8217;s second-in-command, who wears a &#8220;Question
Authority&#8221; button. &#8220;We&#8217;re different. It takes a different kind
of craziness here.&#8221; 
While IBM may move at a slower pace than smaller West Coast
startups, it aims to give Almaden researchers as much leeway as
their Silicon Valley peers, said Winfried Wilcke, senior manager
of the lab&#8217;s nanoscale science and technology research. 
&#8220;If you think of us as dinosaurs, then think of us as
velociraptors,&#8221; he said, referring to the nimble predators of
the Late Cretaceous period. &#8220;The freedom we have here is
great.&#8221; 
Mixed Results 
Silicon Valley labs have a mixed record of getting a
payback -- a high return on investment -- from their
discoveries. While IBM was able to capitalize on Almaden&#8217;s
invention of the disk drive and relational database, many of
Xerox Corp.&#8217;s early innovations at its Palo Alto Research Center
-- such as the Macintosh-style graphical user interface --
brought more benefit to other companies. 
&#8220;Making some bets that are unlinked to specific outcomes
is important, but if it&#8217;s all kind of curiosity-driven research,
the ROI on innovation investing may not be that high,&#8221; said
John Kao, chairman of the Institute for Large Scale Innovation
in San Francisco. 
Some investors say IBM needs big deals more than research
to increase revenue. While the company has boosted earnings per
share through such steps as buybacks and cost controls, rivals
Oracle Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have eclipsed its stock-
price performance in part through big purchases that added to
sales. 
Research, Dealmaking 
Since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer of IBM
in 2002, it spent $25 billion buying publicly held companies.
Compare that with at least $45 billion for Hewlett-Packard and
$42 billion for Oracle. IBM stock has risen 25 percent in the
Palmisano era, compared with 53 percent for Oracle and 128
percent for Hewlett-Packard. 
Palmisano said in May that he plans to spend $20 billion
more on acquisitions in the next five years. On Palmisano&#8217;s
watch, IBM also has increased its research spending by 31
percent. Last year, it devoted $5.8 billion, about 6 percent of
annual revenue, to RD. 
The Silicon Valley version of IBM fosters a freer attitude
and more of a startup mentality than headquarters in Armonk, New
York. While the century-old IBM is known for white shirts, dark
suits and button-downed attitude, the staff at Almaden tackles
oddball research projects and unwinds by holding sack races and
tug-of-war competitions. 
&#8216;Crazy Scientists&#8217; 
Located on a hill in a 1,600-acre wildlife preserve, the
Almaden lab is painted a custom dark-green color derived from
leaves and grass that employees gathered on site. The lobby
boasts a 5-foot-diameter digital display globe that was
purchased after researchers saw a similar device at a Denver
museum and thought it would be &#8220;cool&#8221; to have one. 
&#8220;New York was like, &#8216;You crazy scientists can do this, but
come August, you have show us results,&#8217;&#8221; said Julia Grace, a
social and collaborative computing engineer. The globe has been
used to plot last year&#8217;s swine flu outbreak and more recently to
show the location of people sending messages delivered via
Twitter Inc. during World Cup soccer matches. 
Almaden&#8217;s projects include an electric battery for
automobiles that could run 500 miles on one charge, a filtration
system for desalination and a program that shows changes in
geographical data. Researchers can shake up an industry, even if
they don&#8217;t make a fortune, Haas said. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get rich, but you can change the
world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;IBM is a big ship, and you need a certain
amount of patience to turn the wheel. But if that ship turns,
the wake in the industry is enormous.&#8221; 
IBM Fellows 
Employees at the lab consider themselves &#8220;wild ducks&#8221; for
working on projects that don&#8217;t fit in with what headquarters in
New York wants to pursue, she said. 
Almaden has a &#8220;better sense of &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;&#8221;
because of its location, said Mark Dean, IBM&#8217;s vice president of
strategy, who works at the Watson lab in Yorktown Heights, New
York. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s the only place in IBM where we&#8217;re doing advanced
battery research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only place we&#8217;re doing water
desalination.&#8221; 
Of IBM&#8217;s nine research centers, Almaden also is the only
one to hold an annual Olympics-style event, where IBM Fellows --
the highest technical honor a researcher can receive at the
company -- compete with interns in athletic events. Competition
for the first-place trophy is so fierce that research team
directors taunt each other in self-directed videos by breaking
wooden boards with their hands or donning Star Trek uniforms. 
High Expectations 
Even with its renegade spirit, Almaden is under growing
pressure to produce results, said David Patterson, a computer
science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. 
&#8220;People expect more product impact from their research
labs than they did 20 to 30 years ago,&#8221; he said. 
In the 1990s, Almaden developed a method of encryption for
media content. Used in memory cards and Blu-ray discs, this
technology has earned IBM millions of dollars in licensing fees. 
Giant magnetoresistive heads, introduced in 1997, helped
hard disk drives increase their data-storage capacity 40-fold. A
query system developed at Almaden in the late 1990s, named
Garlic, integrates data from multiple sources and has earned IBM
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. More recently, the
lab developed a file-management system called GPFS that IBM now
adds to its archiving, networking and cloud computing products. 
Still, technology companies continue to fund research
without knowing where it will lead. Mountain View, California-
based Google lets its workers spend 20 percent of their time
working on personal projects. 
Productivity Gain 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve found that people are more productive when they are
working on projects that really excite them,&#8221; said Jordan
Newman, a Google spokesman. Products including Google News and
Gmail got their start that way. 
At IBM, some projects don&#8217;t pan out. In the early 1990s,
Haas and IBM&#8217;s database management team wanted to figure out a
way of searching the World Wide Web, something that hadn&#8217;t
emerged yet. 
&#8220;If we did it right, we might have invented search before
Google,&#8221; Haas said. &#8220;But we had the wrong model, and we
totally missed the boat. We were thinking about librarians.&#8221; 
Modha, the researcher working on the monkey brain, quit IBM
a decade ago in order to work on his own startup. After a short
time, he realized he didn&#8217;t have the financial acumen to run a
business and returned to Almaden. 
&#8220;We have a 100-year history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The challenge
is, how do we usher in the next 100 years?&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. lowered by 5.5
percent its forecast for New York oil prices this year on
speculation a slowdown in global economies will limit crude&#8217;s
potential to rise. 
The bank cut to $77.25 a barrel its estimate for the
average price of West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York
Mercantile Exchange during the rest of 2010, from a forecast of
$81.75 a barrel made last month, according to a monthly report
e-mailed today. It lowered its forecast for 2011&#8217;s average
price to $79.25 a barrel from $90. 
&#8220;We see both lower prices and a tighter range ahead --
but with increased risks,&#8221; Lawrence Eagles, an analyst for the
U.S. bank, wrote in the report. &#8220;Weaker economic growth,
energy efficiency and Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries intransigence provide downside risks.&#8221; 
Crude may fall next week amid increases in U.S. supplies
and OPEC production, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Crude oil
has declined by 0.5 percent this year to $78.95 a barrel in New
York, after rising 78 percent last year. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s an increased drive towards energy efficiency and
renewable energy in China,&#8221; said Henry Wang, managing director,
of Beijing-based energy consultant Gate International Ltd.
&#8220;This could create downward pressure on oil demand.&#8221; 
Pressure on China&#8217;s oil demand, the world&#8217;s biggest energy
user, affects global consumption, which may impact prices, Wang,
who formerly worked for Royal Dutch Shell Plc. in China, said
by phone from Beijing today. 
Production Cuts 
The absence of &#8220;significant&#8221; demand recovery in markets
such as North America and Europe prompted Singapore-based Tri-
Zen International Ltd. to cut its forecast in April for Brent
Crude to $75 a barrel this year, said Tony Regan, a consultant
in an e-mail today. 
Oil prices may fall more than expected on lower demand and
a risk OPEC member nations won&#8217;t adhere to production cuts,
JPMorgan said. 
&#8220;If demand drops, the Gulf Trio, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates are likely to demand cuts from &#8216;leaky&#8217;
members to rebalance the market, but any delay in response
risks a fall in prices as low as $50 a barrel,&#8221; Eagles said. 
The demand outlook in the projection has been moderated in
recent months because of shifts in the bank&#8217;s economic
forecasts, according to the report. 
&#8220;This month sees further changes, which take down 2010
demand growth to 1.8 million barrels a day and 2011 to a
&#8216;trend&#8217; 1.5 million barrels a day,&#8221; Eagles said. &#8220;The net sum
of our supply and demand changes reduces the call on OPEC by
1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2011.&#8221;

ABC has its &#8220;work cut out&#8221; to
reverse a decline in ratings, said Paul Lee, the executive named
last week to lead the Walt Disney Co. television network. 
Lee headed Disney&#8217;s ABC Family cable channel until Steve McPherson unexpectedly resigned as president of ABC
Entertainment Group on July 27. The executive, who introduced
shows like &#8220;Pretty Little Liars&#8221; aimed at young female viewers
at ABC Family, said he will &#8220;take some risks&#8221; in his new role
to pull the broadcast network out of third place. He stopped
short of saying he&#8217;d target a millennial demographic at ABC. 
&#8220;The way to program a cable network is to do one thing and
do it well,&#8221; Lee told writers at the semi-annual Television
Critics Association today in Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;A
broadcast network is a much larger canvas.&#8221; 
Lee said he will seek to create a brand identity at ABC,
much as CBS has done with procedural dramas and Fox with shows
that appeal to younger men. He said ABC, the only major
broadcaster to decline in ratings last season, is known for
&#8220;smart&#8221; programs. He mentioned &#8220;Dancing With the Stars,&#8221; and
shows he called &#8220;sexy&#8221; like &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.&#8221; 
The London-born Lee, 50, founded the BBC America cable
channel before joining Disney in 2004. He said he was
vacationing with his wife on a California beach when he was
approached to take the ABC job. 
&#8220;You have more time in cable to stick with a show,&#8221; Lee
said. &#8220;But we are always a slave to ratings.&#8221; 
ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. 
&#8216;Body of Proof&#8217; 
The new shows include  including &#8220;Body of Proof,&#8221;
starring Dana Delany, and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; which revolves
around a homicide unit in the city. It also picked up the comedy
&#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as the manager of a
San Diego sports arena. 
&#8220;Paul has been very supportive of us so far, just as Steve
was,&#8221; said Jason Richman, executive producer of &#8220;Detroit 1-8-
7,&#8221; which will air on Tuesdays. &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to continue
to do what we&#8217;ve been doing,&#8221; added David Zabel, the show&#8217;s
other executive producer. 
McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
&#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; Lee
predicted that &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; nominated for the Emmy award
for best comedy, will win. 
&#8216;Upfront Sales&#8217; 
ABC sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new season
for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates rising
8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the matter
said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. 
By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 on July 30 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, won a court ruling that its Xbox video-game
system doesn&#8217;t infringe a patent over multiplayer gaming, ending
a six-year legal battle. 
U.S. District Judge Paul D. Borman in Detroit on July 20
dismissed the 2004 lawsuit against Microsoft brought by
inventors Peter Hochstein and Jeffrey Tennenbaum along with
Harold Milton Jr., who owns rights to the patent. The men had
been demanding royalties on Xbox sales, plus an order barring
further use of their invention. 
The patent, issued in 1994, is for a device that lets two
or more people play video games together without being in the
same location, such as over a telephone line. The men claimed
that could be construed to cover all systems that can have
multiple players, like the Xbox. 
Borman ruled that the patent only covered game systems that
are electrically connected. Such a connection doesn&#8217;t include
the type of link among players used by the Xbox, the judge said. 
The Michigan men also sued Sony Corp., maker of the
PlayStation video-game system. That case was settled. Lawyers
for the men didn&#8217;t immediately return a message seeking comment.
Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the Redmond,
Washington-based company was pleased with the decision. 
The case is Hochstein v. Microsoft, 04-73071, U.S. District
Court for the District of Michigan (Detroit).

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, plans to
sell $1.5 billion of three-year notes, leading a surge in U.S.
corporate bond issuance. 
IBM plans to sell the debt as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the offering who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t set. New York-based Citigroup Inc. and
ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, are among at
least five other issuers marketing debt today. 
IBM&#8217;s offering comes after U.S. corporate bond issuance set
a record last month and yields on the debt fell to the lowest in
more than four years. Investors are snapping up the debt as 77
percent of companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index that
have reported second-quarter earnings beat analysts&#8217; estimates
and manufacturing growth in the U.S. and Britain slowed less
than expected in July, bolstering confidence in the economic
recovery. 
&#8220;Companies are taking advantage of a window of
opportunity,&#8221; said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economic
research at Aladdin Capital LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;The
money is inexpensive and people are willing to buy.&#8221; 
IBM&#8217;s notes may yield 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage
point, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person. 
Credit Suisse Group AG, Expedia Inc., Omnicom Group Inc.
and Newell Rubbermaid also plan to tap the corporate bond market
as soon as today, according to people familiar with those
offerings. 
Record Bond Issuance 
Continental Airlines Inc. and Arch Coal Inc. may sell debt
later this week, people with knowledge of the transactions said. 
Companies sold $85.7 billion of U.S. corporate bonds in
July, the most in that month since at least 1999, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Average yields on the securities
fell to 5.01 percent on July 31, the lowest since April 2004,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good time for companies to be issuing debt
and they have excellent balance sheets that they&#8217;re leveraging
as well,&#8221; John Herrmann, a senior fixed-income strategist at
Boston-based State Street Global Markets LLC, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;We have extremely low rates
and yet at the same time investors are searching for yield over
Treasuries.&#8221; 
Yields on two-year Treasury notes climbed 1 basis point to
0.56 percent after dropping to a record low 0.546 percent. Ten-
year Treasury yields climbed 4 basis points to 2.95 percent.
They touched 2.85 percent, a 15-month low, on July 21. 
Use of Proceeds 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas are
managing IBM&#8217;s offering, the person said. Armonk, New York-based
IBM plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, the
person said. 
IBM spokesman Mike Fay confirmed the maturity of the notes
and the timing of the offering and declined to provide further
details. 
The company last sold debt in November, when it issued $750
million of two-year floating-rate notes and $1.25 billion of
3.5-year fixed-rate securities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. 
The 2.1 percent notes due in May 2013 fell 0.136 cent on
July 27 to 102.869 cents on the dollar to yield 1.045 percent,
or 4.9 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service assigns IBM a grade of A1 and
Standard  Poor&#8217;s ranks it an equivalent A+.

Alexander Classen, head of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s wealth-management operations in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, has left the firm after four years. 
The New York-based bank hasn&#8217;t named a replacement, said
spokesman Jim Wiggins, who confirmed Classen&#8217;s departure.
Classen joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the same year that James Gorman, now chief executive
officer, came in to turn around the brokerage. 
Morgan Stanley paid $2.75 billion last year to win control
of a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney that
includes about 18,000 financial advisers, making it the world&#8217;s
biggest brokerage. 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster, Charles Johnston, the unit&#8217;s president, said in April. The global
wealth-management division had net new international assets of
$2.4 billion in the second quarter, compared with outflows of
$7.9 billion in the U.S. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a large enough footprint in those
markets,&#8221; Johnston said in April. &#8220;We&#8217;d like it to be bigger,
and there&#8217;s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or
you can grow organically. There hasn&#8217;t been much that&#8217;s been
available to buy. We&#8217;ve talked about some deals, but we&#8217;re going
on the path of organic growth.&#8221; 
Dow Jones Newswire reported Classen&#8217;s departure earlier
today.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gave the
panel investigating the causes of the credit crisis examples of
how it set prices for illiquid mortgage derivatives before the
U.S. rescue of American International Group Inc. 
The data provided to the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission include mortgage-related trades from May 2007 through
November 2008, which the New York-based firm reported in a nine-
page document on its website. Those trades and other market
information showed that prices were falling, which in turn led
to demands for collateral from AIG, Goldman Sachs said. 
During two days of hearings earlier this year, FCIC members
questioned whether the investment bank deliberately discounted
prices to push markets lower because it had bet on a decline in
the value of subprime mortgage-backed debt. Gary Cohn, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s president and chief operating officer, and Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said at the hearings that the
firm&#8217;s prices reflected what it saw in the market. 
In the document on its website, Goldman Sachs said &#8220;a
certain degree of judgment was necessary&#8221; in valuing the
transactions. &#8220;We were able to access the best available market
information to price these CDO securities and to ensure that our
pricing represented actual fair market values at the time,&#8221; the
firm said in the document. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the details of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s response to the FCIC late yesterday on its website. 
Risk Management 
The dispute is at the heart of whether Goldman Sachs had a
role in the near-bankruptcy of AIG or was a careful risk manager
whose focus on marking assets to fair value helped the
securities firm prepare for the credit contraction earlier than
rivals. Goldman Sachs, whose 2007 profit benefited from bets
against securities backed by subprime mortgages, was one of the
biggest buyers of AIG&#8217;s insurance covering such debt and
increased demands for collateral from AIG as prices fell. 
&#8220;You guys are net short and you&#8217;re driving down prices,
are you creating a self-fulfilling prophecy?&#8221; Philip N. Angelides, chairman of the FCIC, asked Viniar during the
hearings. &#8220;Were you in fact pushing the market down?&#8221; 
The FCIC is investigating what caused the credit crisis,
and will report findings to Congress and President Barack Obama
by December.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
second-largest producer of oil from deep-water wells, is seeking
to sell its stake in discoveries off the coast of the Republic
of Congo. 
Exxon owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, which hold the
equivalent of 500 million barrels of recoverable crude, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a posting today on
Schlumberger Ltd.&#8217;s asset-sale website. 
Exxon&#8217;s stake in the resource has a value of about $12
billion at current average New York crude prices for the year.
The Mer Tres Profonde Sud block covers 3,818 square kilometers
(1,474 square miles). 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil has a long-standing practice of continually
reviewing all assets for the contribution to the company&#8217;s
operating needs and financial objectives, as well as their
potential value to others,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed message. 
Exxon rose 78 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $62.72 as of 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock fell 11
percent in the past 12 months, the second-worst performance in
the NYSE Arca Oil Index. BP Plc&#8217;s American depositary receipts
had the largest decline among index members, tumbling 23
percent. 
An online data room for the Congolese fields will open on
Aug. 9, followed by a physical data room on Aug. 16, according
to the posting. A data room is where potential suitors can get
more information about the geological features and other
characteristics of oil fields. Exxon will accept proposals
through Oct. 22. 
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil
company, is the biggest producer of crude from deep-water
fields, according to PFC Energy.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s second-quarter profit
beat analyst estimates after sales were boosted by a weaker
dollar and products from its acquisition of Wyeth. The shares
rose the most in almost 17 months. 
Profit excluding one-time items was 62 cents a share,
beating the 52 cents average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue increased 58 percent to $17.3 billion, $696 million more
than analysts had estimated. 
Sales benefited from a $584 million gain in foreign
currency exchange and from the addition of the Enbrel arthritis
treatment and Prevnar pneumonia vaccine from Pfizer&#8217;s $68
billion acquisition of Wyeth last year. The company reaffirmed
its forecast for 2010, saying earnings may be at the higher end
of the target. 
&#8220;This is a major statement by a company that has had a
rough year,&#8221; said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS Securities
LLC, in a note to clients. &#8220;This is the kind of quarter that

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is offering
to give investors in the highest-rated portions of a bond sale
backed by commercial mortgages control in the event the loans go
bad as bankers attempt to revive the market. 
The $788.5 million offering gives holders of the safest
portion of the transaction, or about 81 percent of the deal, the
power to direct and replace firms hired to handle loans that
become troubled, according to marketing documents distributed
last week to investors. Typically, that right is held by
investors who buy the smaller, riskiest slice. 
It&#8217;s &#8220;plowing new ground,&#8221; said Patrick Sargent, a
partner at Dallas law firm Andrews  Kurth LLP. 
Goldman Sachs is attempting to address concern that holders
of the riskiest pieces of commercial mortgage bonds in the $700
billion market may make decisions that favor their interest over
other investors in the transactions when loans sour. Late
payments on office buildings, shopping centers and other
properties jumped to a record 7.71 percent as of June 30, from
2.67 percent a year earlier, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service. 
&#8220;This is a big nod to the AAA buyers,&#8221; Lisa Pendergast, a
strategist at Jefferies  Co. in Stamford, Connecticut, said in
an interview. 
A unit of New York-based hedge-fund firm Elliott Management
Corp. bought the slice most likely to take losses in the latest
mortgage-bond offering by Goldman Sachs, according to the
marketing documents. Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for Elliott,
and Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
&#8216;B-Piece&#8217; Buyers 
Investors who hold the most-junior slices, or B-pieces, are
first to be wiped out as losses mount and may have an incentive
to keep the debt outstanding rather than foreclose, punishing
other holders. 
&#8220;Some investors don&#8217;t like the link between the B-piece
buyer and the special servicer,&#8221; Sargent, a member of the
executive committee of the Commercial Real Estate Finance
Council, a New York-based trade group, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It was one of the points raised&#8221; by investors in
discussions about how to restart issuance, he said. 
Units of special servicers, which are firms that handle
troubled loans, often were buyers of the riskiest portions of
commercial-mortgage bonds, Sargent said. 
Top-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities yield 2.73
percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 3.95
percentage points more than the benchmark at the beginning of
the year, according to a Barclays Plc index. A year ago, the
debt was yielding a spread of 5 percentage points. 
&#8216;Innovative Structure&#8217; 
The offering being marketed by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
Inc., the fourth sale backed by newly originated commercial
mortgages this year, uses an &#8220;innovative structure,&#8221; according
to Andy Solomon, a managing director at Angelo Gordon  Co. with
$23 billion in assets under management. It still doesn&#8217;t
eliminate potential conflicts of interest, he said in an
interview. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any reason to believe that AAA holders would
influence special servicers to make better decisions for all
bondholders as a group,&#8221; said Solomon, who is based in New York
and oversees $4 billion in commercial-mortgage-backed bonds.
&#8220;These are the same folks that wanted to liquidate loans at
fire sale prices into a no-bid market two years ago.&#8221; 
Holders of the top-ranked debt get paid first if the loan
is liquidated, meaning it may be to their advantage to foreclose
sooner rather than later, even if property prices are at a
bottom. U.S. commercial property prices, down 39 percent from
2007 peaks, rose for the second straight month in May, according
to Moody&#8217;s. 
Higher Yielding 
Some investors may shy away from buying the lowest-ranked
portion of a commercial-mortgage backed bond deal if they can&#8217;t
exert control over soured loans, though the chase for higher-
yielding assets may make it an easier sell, Sargent said. 
&#8220;This is an environment where there are more investors for
that riskier slice,&#8221; he said. 
An affiliate of BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest asset
manager, bought the non-investment grade portion of a $716.3
million commercial-mortgage bond offering sold by JPMorgan Chase
 Co. on June 11, according to deal documents disseminated to
investors at the time of the sale. 
The BlackRock affiliate retained &#8220;certain control
rights,&#8221; including directing the special servicer, the
documents show. Lauren Trengrove, a spokeswoman for BlackRock,
declined to comment, as did Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan
spokesman. 
The Goldman Sachs offering comes as banks are trying to
revive the market after sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2
billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Banks arranged $3.4 billion of the securities last year,
and about $1.7 billion has been issued in 2010. The lack of
sales chokes off funding to borrowers with maturing debt.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, said it intends to reinstate
$1.35 billion of bonds instead of seeking a term loan under a
revised reorganization plan to exit bankruptcy. 
General Growth, based in Chicago, filed the revised plan
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The company said
it still expects to leave bankruptcy in October, as proposed in
the earlier plan. 
Under the amended plan, $1.35 billion of company bonds due
in 2012 and 2013 will be reinstated with accrued interest paid
to holders instead of giving them the option of taking cash,
according to court documents. 
General Growth has secured $8.55 billion in capital
commitments for its restructuring from Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., Fairholme Funds Inc. and Pershing Square
Capital Management LP. 
Other plan changes include General Growth&#8217;s consent to a
sale by the investor group of as much as $500 million of their
equity stake to Blackstone Group LP, the company said in a
statement yesterday. 
In addition, the investors have agreed to buy $250 million
of new equity in a new company General Growth is spinning off
instead of backstopping a $250 million rights offering for the
company. 
Last Stage 
General Growth is in the last stage of its bankruptcy case,
which began after the mall owner failed to refinance its debt
during the credit crunch. At the time, commercial real estate
prices in the U.S. had dropped 15 percent and retail sales had
fallen as job losses forced consumers to pull back on spending. 
At a court hearing set for Aug. 19, General Growth will ask
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan to approve a
disclosure statement explaining the plan so that creditors can
begin voting on it. 
General Growth has interests in more than 200 regional
shopping malls in 43 states. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, persuaded a Missouri judge to deny class-action
status for a lawsuit alleging the company illegally marketed its
Neurontin epilepsy medicine. 
Judge Donald L. McCullin in St. Louis refused on July 27 to
allow Missouri Neurontin buyers to combine claims that Pfizer
sold the drug for unapproved uses and misled users about its
effectiveness, according to state-court filings. Two consumers
sought to have their case certified as a class action to recover
money spent on Neurontin prescriptions. 
&#8220;The evidence in the record shows Neurontin is effective
for treatment of many conditions,&#8221; McCullin wrote in his 13-
page decision. &#8220;The court cannot certify this putative class
because it appears from the record that it would include more
than a small number of uninjured individuals.&#8221; 
Pfizer, based in New York, faces at least 400 lawsuits
accusing it of illegally promoting Neurontin. In March, a Boston
jury ordered Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to
an insurer over its marketing practices in connection with the
drug. 
The company also has settled at least two suits alleging
the drug played a role in users&#8217; suicides, paying almost
$400,000 in one of the accords, people familiar with the deals
said earlier this year. 
&#8216;Far From Over&#8217; 
Pfizer is pleased with McCullin&#8217;s decision, spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. The judge found the
case wasn&#8217;t suitable for class-action treatment because
potential class members had different types of claims depending
on how the drug worked for them. 
&#8220;We think this ruling is subject to challenge,&#8221; Gerald
Meunier, a New Orleans-based lawyer representing Missouri
plaintiffs Elizabeth Judy and Stephen Brown, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;This case is far from over.&#8221; 
Some Neurontin users contend that Pfizer&#8217;s Warner-Lambert
unit intentionally violated federal law by marketing the
epilepsy drug for more than a dozen medical conditions that
weren&#8217;t approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration
regulators. 
Warner-Lambert officials pleaded guilty in 2004 to criminal
charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department and paid a $430
million fine over allegations the company illegally marketed
Neurontin. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. 
Consumer Law 
In the Missouri case, lawyers for Judy and Brown argued
that Neurontin purchasers overpaid for the drug based on the
company&#8217;s illegal marketing tactics and deserved to able to join
together in a group suit to recoup that money. 
They also argued Neurontin wasn&#8217;t effective for the non-
approved uses that Warner-Lambert targeted in its marketing
effort. The plaintiffs brought the case under a Missouri
consumer statute, Meunier said. 
The Missouri case is Judy v. Pfizer Inc., 042-01946-02,
Missouri Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit (St.
Louis).

General Motors Co., the biggest
overseas automaker in China, boosted sales in the nation 22
percent in July, aided by the popularity of Chevrolet cars,
while deliveries by Ford Motor Co.&#8217;s local sales unit fell. 
GM sold 176,645 vehicles last month in the world&#8217;s largest
auto market, after boosting deliveries of Chevrolet vehicles 70
percent to 35,385, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Sales of GM-brand vehicles rose 45 percent to 1.3 million
in the first seven months of the year, it added. 
The carmaker is counting on expansion in China and other
overseas markets to bolster profit as it prepares for an initial
public offering as early as the fourth quarter. GM&#8217;s first-half
sales in China surpassed those in the U.S. for the first time
this year as the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy propelled
global auto demand. 
&#8220;GM has been doing the right things by tapping demand
growth in smaller cities with smaller cars,&#8221; said Han Weiqi, an
analyst at CSC International Holdings Ltd. in Shanghai. &#8220;When
overall demand growth slows in the second half, companies
deploying the wrong approaches will be hit much harder.&#8221; 
Ford&#8217;s Sales Decline 
Changan Ford Sales Co., the Chinese sales unit of Ford,
delivered 18,255 vehicles in July, it said in statement today.
Sales in July 2009 by Changan Ford totaled 19,486, the automaker
said on its website last year. 
Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., which makes cars with
Ford in China, fell 3.1 percent, the most in more than two weeks,
to close at 10.20 yuan in Shenzhen trading today. 
China&#8217;s total passenger car sales to consumers rose 15.4
percent last month to 822,300, the China Automotive Technology 
Research Center said yesterday. Vehicle demand may weaken in
August, the center said. 
GM, which makes vehicles including Buick Excelle cars and
Chevrolet Cruze compacts with its Chinese joint-venture partner
SAIC Motor Co. in China, has added new models at a much faster
pace than Ford, CSC&#8217;s Han said. 
GM, based in Detroit, is refreshing its lineup in China
with new models such as the Chevrolet Sail compact and Buick
Excelle GT small sedan, the automaker said last month. 
The company also makes Sunshine minivans at SAIC-GM-Wuling
Automotive Co., a separate joint venture in which the U.S.
automaker has a 34 percent stake.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s Escalade is the
most-stolen car of the past decade as thieves seek &#8220;chrome,
horsepower, Hemis&#8221; and leather, according to the Highway Loss
Data Institute. 
The Escalade, a luxury sport utility vehicle priced between
$60,000 and $190,000, again topped the list, as it has every
year since 2000, the insurance industry study group said in a
report released today. 
For every 1,000 insured Cadillac Escalades, during the 2007
through 2009 model years, an average of 10.8 were reported
stolen, said the study group, which is an affiliate of the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The next most stolen is
the Ford F-250, a large pickup, followed by the Infiniti G37
two-door, a midsize luxury car, and the Dodge Charger with a
hemi engine, a large family car. 
&#8220;Sedate family cars and fuel sippers aren&#8217;t on the hot
list,&#8221; said Kim Hazelbaker, the group&#8217;s senior vice president.
&#8220;Thieves are after chrome, horsepower and Hemis.&#8221; 
The average claim for an Escalade is seven times the
average for all passenger vehicles -- $11,934, which is a
fraction of its sticker price. That&#8217;s because thieves often
steal only parts of the SUV, such as the stereo system or the
hubcaps. 
The Chevrolet Corvette Z06 sports car has the highest
average claim cost among the most stolen, at $41,229. 
Most-stolen models aside, since 1998, the frequency of auto
theft claims has declined while the cost per vehicle has risen. 
Pickups&#8217; Theft Appeal 
Pickup trucks are growing in theft popularity, according to
the institute. The trucks are already the top stolen vehicles in
Houston, said Jim Woods, who has been an auto theft officer at
the Houston Police Department for 17 years. 
Pickups prove useful tools for other crimes, Woods said.
Storage space in the truck is helpful for transporting drugs and
other illegal items. Its four-wheel drive also means the
criminal can escape off-road, he said. 
The least frequently stolen vehicles are Japanese makes
such as the Toyota Prius and the Nissan Murano, and family cars
like the Toyota Sienna 4WD and the Volvo S80, according to the
institute&#8217;s data. 
Thieves are attracted by the Escalade&#8217;s leather interior,
which can be easily bolted into less luxurious SUVs such as the
Chevrolet Suburban or Tahoe, said Houston&#8217;s Officer Woods. &#8220;You
wonder how many Chevrolet Tahoes are running around with
Cadillac interiors,&#8221; he said. 
GM has added a steering lock to the vehicle and OnStar
tracking, which allows the Escalade to be slowed down remotely
by authorities, said Nick Twork, a spokesman for Cadillac.
Customers aren&#8217;t deterred from buying the car because it&#8217;s the
most-stolen, he said. 
&#8220;If someone wants to steal any car, they can do it,&#8221;
Twork said. &#8220;It speaks to the desirability of certain aspects
of the Escalade.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $788.5 million of bonds backed by commercial
mortgages in the fourth offering of the debt this year as Wall
Street seeks to jumpstart sales. 
The largest top-rated portions of the transactions, a
$410.6 million slice maturing in 9.86 years, yields 135 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the offering who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t public. Similar debt sold in 2006 and 2007 when
sales peaked and underwriting bottomed yields about 320 basis
points over the benchmark, according to Deutsche Bank AG data. 
The deal is the third to pool loans from multiple property
owners this year, and included new features designed to appease
investors as banks attempt to revive the $700 billion market.
Sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record
$234 billion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The changes are a &#8220;sharp departure&#8221; from past transactions,
according to a Deutsche Bank report today. 
&#8220;The changes were no doubt made to better the structure
and make the deal more attractive to investors,&#8221; the New York-
based analyst Harris Trifon said in the report. &#8220;The sheer
number of changes makes it difficult to assess how smoothly the
deal will function in practice.&#8221; 
One of the key changes is giving buyers of the highest-
rated portions control of who manages troubled loans, a right
that has historically been held by investors who buy the
riskiest slice, the so-called B piece. Some investors are
concerned that those holders may make decisions that favor their
own interests when loans go bad. 
&#8216;Material Impact&#8217; Unlikely 
Stripping control from the buyers most susceptible to
losses could make it harder to sell the debt, Trifon wrote. 
&#8220;With a relatively limited supply and strong demand, this
issue in isolation is not likely to have a material impact,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Assuming the new deal pipeline continues to grow, the
market might have a hard time finding enough B-piece buyers
willing to participate without some control rights.&#8221; 
Banks arranged $3.4 billion of securities backed by newly
originated commercial mortgages last year, and about $2.49
billion has been issued in 2010, Bloomberg data show.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked a New
York judge to dismiss a $1 billion lawsuit by Australian hedge
fund Basis Capital, arguing that a June U.S. Supreme Court
decision bars the claim. 
The lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund
focuses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sale of the &#8220;Timberwolf&#8221;
collateralized debt obligation. The complaint, filed June 9 in
Manhattan federal court, says the fund was forced into
insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities created by
Goldman Sachs, in what one of its own executives described
internally as a &#8220;shi**y deal.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs argued that the suit is barred by the Supreme
Court&#8217;s June 24 ruling in Morrison v. National Australia Bank.
In that case, the high court held that U.S. securities laws
don&#8217;t apply to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S.
securities on foreign exchanges. 
&#8220;This litigation presents a contract dispute between two
foreign entities, executed abroad and governed by English law,
and Morrison makes clear that it does not belong in this
court,&#8221; New York-based Goldman said in a filing dated Aug. 2. 
Eric Lewis, a lawyer for Basis, said &#8220;there are significant
arguments to be made&#8221; that Morrison doesn&#8217;t bar the Basis
claim. 
The credit-default swaps in the transaction were
derivatives of U.S. securities, Lewis said. The location of the
transaction was really New York, and Goldman Sachs International
was acting as an agent of New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in the transaction, he said. 
In the complaint, Basis alleged that Goldman falsely
claimed in June 2007 that the market for investments such as
Timberwolf had stabilized. Basis claims it closed on its deal
with Goldman to buy credit default swaps tied to Timberwolf at
the same time Thomas Montag, Goldman&#8217;s former head of sales and
trading for the Americas, sent the e-mail calling the Timberwolf
CDO &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; 
Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, is seeking
compensatory and punitive damages from Goldman. 
The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley, the biggest lead
manager on stock offerings for clean-energy companies last year,
hired bankers who specialize in that industry from Lazard Ltd.
and Credit Suisse Group AG, said a person briefed on the matter. 
Schuyler &#8220;Skip&#8221; Grow, a New York-based banker at Lazard,
and Robert Mansley, at Credit Suisse in London, are joining as
managing directors, said the person, who declined to be
identified because Grow and Mansley haven&#8217;t yet started in their
new positions. Morgan Stanley also added clean-energy bankers in
Hong Kong and Mumbai, the person said. 
Morgan Stanley is building its clean technology and
renewable energy investment banking group after handling initial
public offerings for China Longyuan Power Group Corp., China&#8217;s
biggest wind-power producer, and A123 Systems Inc., the
Watertown, Massachusetts-based car battery company. Morgan
Stanley handled 10 transactions worth a total of $2.9 billion,
the most of any lead manager, according to a ranking by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 
Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. 
UBS AG, Citigroup Inc., and Deutsche Bank AG held the next-
highest spots in the 2009 ranking.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. are among the four banks that may manage a 20
percent stake sale in Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.,
according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
ICICI Securities Ltd. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. may also
be hired, the people said, declining to be named before an
official announcement. Seventeen banks had bid to manage the
offering, with presentations ending yesterday in New Delhi,
according to a notice on the Gurgaon-based company&#8217;s website. 
The government and Power Grid, India&#8217;s largest energy
transmission company, will sell a combined 841.8 million shares,
it said in July. Shares of Power Grid rose 0.3 percent to 100.15
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai yesterday, valuing a 20
percent stake at 84.3 billion rupees ($1.83 billion). 
Power Grid Chairman S.K. Chaturvedi wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment on his mobile-phone yesterday. Spokespeople
at the banks didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails. 
The lowest fees bid was 0.00000001 percent, one of the
people said. Banks shortlisted for the sale have to match the
lowest bidder to win the mandate, according to the government&#8217;s
guidelines. 
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are among U.S. banks seeking to
make more of their revenue in developing markets such as India
as tougher regulations and slower economic growth reduce
opportunities in the U.S. and Europe. 
JPMorgan in June named Heidi Miller, a longtime associate
of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, to a newly created
position focusing on overseas expansion. David Viniar, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told analysts on July 20 that
the firm is investing more in faster-growing emerging markets. 
Bidders that vied for the mandate included Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
Nomura Holdings Inc., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and UBS AG, the notice showed. The domestic banks were
Enam Securities Pvt., Edelweiss Capital Ltd., IDBI Capital

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, won approval of a
$500 million investment from a Texas public pension plan to help
finance its exit from bankruptcy. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York today
approved a plan for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas to
buy $500 million of shares in the reorganized General Growth at
$10.25 a share. 
&#8220;I will approve the agreement as a reasonable exercise of
the debtors&#8217; powers under the bankruptcy code,&#8221; Gropper said.
There was no opposition to the investment. 
The pension plan is joining Brookfield Asset Management
Inc., Fairholme Funds Inc. and Pershing Square Capital
Management LP to finance the Chicago company&#8217;s exit from
bankruptcy protection, which is set for October. 
Under the plan, Brookfield, Fairholme and Pershing have
agreed to buy $6.3 billion of stock in the reorganized company
at $10 a share in addition to other commitments. The pension
plan will hold a 4.9 percent stake in General Growth when it
emerges from bankruptcy, and the other three investors will
receive 62.8 percent before the exercise of warrants, according
to court documents. 
The Texas pension investment will reduce the other
investors&#8217; total $8.55 billion investment by $500 million,
lawyers for General Growth said. 
The agreement approved today includes a $15 million breakup
fee. 
Under the agreement, General Growth can reduce the Texas
teachers&#8217; investment by as much as 50 percent if more favorable
financing becomes available. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may say second-quarter profit fell on
lower investment income and asset writedowns. 
Net income probably declined to 353 million euros ($466
million) from 400 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
estimates ranged from 181 million euros to 468 million euros. 
&#8220;The decline in equity markets is likely to depress
results as lower capital gains and higher equity impairments
reduce net profit,&#8221; Andreas de Groot van Embden, an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase  Co. with an &#8220;underweight&#8221; recommendation on
the stock, wrote in report today. 
Profitability at insurers is under pressure as low interest
rates and equity-market turbulence weigh on investment returns,
while flood claims and lower margins hurt property and casualty
business. Cesare Geronzi, who was appointed Generali&#8217;s new
chairman in April, aims to boost growth in emerging markets,
including China and the Middle East, and in eastern Europe to
recover from the global financial crisis. 
Analysts including Fabrizio Croce at Kepler Capital Markets
expect non-life business to be affected by claims related
natural catastrophes in Germany and central eastern Europe. 
The company&#8217;s combined ratio, a measure of profitability,
may have worsened to 98.6 percent in the first half from 97.9
percent a year earlier, the survey showed. 
Life gross premiums at the Trieste, Italy-based insurer
probably rose 4 percent to 11.7 billion euros, according to the
analyst survey. 
The insurer is due to report earnings tomorrow and to hold
a conference call at 4 p.m. local time. Following is a table of
the analysts&#8217; estimates and the year-earlier results. The
figures are in millions of euros, except the combined ratio.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., suing to
overturn a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of the
failed hedge-fund firm Bayou Group LLC, got support from the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. 
The association, which says it represents the interests of
&#8220;hundreds of securities firms, banks and asset managers,&#8221;
filed a brief in federal court in New York today in support of
Goldman Sachs, claiming the case &#8220;has potentially industrywide
implications, especially for clearing brokers.&#8221; 
The creditors claim Goldman Sachs facilitated the
$400 million fraud committed by Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel,
who is now serving 22 years in prison. Stamford, Connecticut-
based Bayou filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2006. 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
independent regulatory group for the securities industry, on
June 24 issued a decision in favor of Bayou&#8217;s creditors in an
arbitration targeting Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP for
its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for Bayou&#8217;s
hedge funds. Goldman sued last month to overturn the decision. 
&#8220;In imposing liability on Goldman, the arbitrators
disregarded the long-recognized principle that a clearing firm
cannot be liable for merely processing transactions received
from an authorized source,&#8221; the trade association argued. 
John Rich of New York&#8217;s Rich  Intelisano LLP, a lawyer for
Bayou&#8217;s unsecured creditors, defended FINRA&#8217;s finding. 
&#8220;This was an experienced and well-seasoned arbitration
panel&#8217;s decision after an 18-day trial and lengthy closing
arguments on the law and facts,&#8221;&#160;he said in an e-mail today. 
&#8216;Speed and Efficiency&#8217; 
&#8220;If clearing firms were required to analyze trading in
introduced accounts, or to make determinations concerning
whether the records and documents in their possession regarding
the activities of an introducing firm&#8217;s customers indicated
possible wrongdoing, the speed and efficiency demanded in the
contemporary securities markets would not be possible,&#8221; the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said in
its filing. 
The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v.
Official Unsecured Creditors&#8217; Committee of Bayou Group LLC, 10-
CV-5622, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

A federal judge denied a motion by
two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. bankers to dismiss a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit alleging a pay-to-play scheme in
Jefferson County, Alabama, that allowed the bank to win almost
$5 billion in bond and interest-rate swap business. 
U.S. District Judge Abdul Kallon in Birmingham rejected
arguments by Douglas MacFaddin, the former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s
municipal derivatives desk, and investment banker Charles LeCroy
that the SEC doesn&#8217;t have jurisdiction over interest-rate swaps.
The unregulated derivatives were used by the county to lower
borrowing costs on debt issued to rebuild its sewer system. 
Kallon said it was too early in the case to resolve the
question of whether the swaps were &#8220;security-based&#8221; and
therefore subject to SEC oversight. 
MacFaddin&#8217;s and LeCroy&#8217;s challenge to the SEC&#8217;s
jurisdiction failed because they relied on a disputed fact, that
the swaps were based on an interest-rate index, rather than an
index of securities, Kallon wrote in a 22-page opinion. 
The SEC filed suit against the pair last year, alleging the
New York-based bank made more than $8 million in undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners. The associates
owned or worked at local broker-dealer firms that didn&#8217;t do any
work on the deals, which have nearly bankrupted the county, the
state&#8217;s most populous. 
Larry Langford, the former president of the Jefferson
County Commission and former mayor of Birmingham, is serving 15
years in prison after being convicted of accepting $235,000 in
designer clothes, Rolex watches and cash from an Alabama banker
who was paid almost $3 million by JPMorgan. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Charles E. LeCroy and Douglas W. MacFaddin., 09-CV-02238, U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s principal-
strategies business, a unit that makes bets with the firm&#8217;s own
capital, plans to transform into a fund and raise outside money,
a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. 
Goldman Sachs may announce as soon as tomorrow plans to
discontinue the business, which is part of the New York-based
bank&#8217;s equities unit, the person said, declining to be named
because the decision hasn&#8217;t been made public. The team, which
aims to complete the process by the end of the year, hasn&#8217;t set
a target for the amount it wants to raise, the person said. 
The Dodd-Frank Act signed by President Barack Obama last
month prohibits banks such as Goldman Sachs from engaging in
proprietary trading. Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies, led by
Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, 44, may be keen to raise money
before competition emerges from proprietary-trading teams
leaving other banks, analyst Brad Hintz said. 
&#8220;What you don&#8217;t want to be is the 50th prop desk being
spun out,&#8221; Hintz, at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York,
said in an interview. &#8220;I think what they&#8217;re saying is, &#8216;Get out
while the getting&#8217;s good.&#8217;&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which doesn&#8217;t break out the size of teams
like GSPS or the revenue or profit they generate, has said it
derives about 10 percent of annual revenue on average from
proprietary-trading activities. 
Reviewing Operations 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Last week, asked to comment on the firm&#8217;s
plans for its proprietary-trading teams, he said: &#8220;Given the
changes coming to financial regulation, we are as you would
expect reviewing those operations likely to be affected.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley is in talks to spin off its FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund unit, according to people familiar with
the plans. The New York-based bank may retain a stake in the
business, which is run by Daniel Waters and Michael Kelly, said
one of the people, who declined to be named because the talks
aren&#8217;t public. 
Morgan Stanley purchased FrontPoint in 2006. The firm paid
$400 million for its stake, people familiar with the terms said
at the time. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in
February that the firm was &#8220;evaluating&#8221; its investments in
hedge funds, including FrontPoint. 
Erica Platt, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment on market rumors. 
&#8216;Good Opportunity&#8217; 
&#8220;Some of these guys feel that now is a good opportunity to
strike out on their own,&#8221; said Steven Nadel, a New York-based
partner who specializes in advising hedge funds at law firm
Seward  Kissel LLP, who wasn&#8217;t speaking on Goldman Sachs or
FrontPoint specifically. Still, he added that &#8220;it&#8217;s not easy to
raise money&#8221; and new requirements for funds to register with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can add to the
complexity of starting funds. 
Under the so-called Volcker rule provision in the Dodd-
Frank Act, banks would be allowed to contribute up to 3 percent
of the equity in hedge funds or private-equity funds. Goldman
Sachs has a history of investing with former traders who start
hedge funds. Alumni who left to start hedge funds include Eric Mindich at Eton Park Capital Management LP, Dinakar Singh at
TPG-Axon Capital Management, and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC. 
In 2007, about half the members of the Goldman Sachs
Principal Strategies team created a fund called Goldman Sachs
Investment Partners that remains housed in the firm&#8217;s money-
management division. Some traders who stayed in the principal-
strategies unit, including Pierre-Henri Flamand and Ali Hedayat,
left Goldman Sachs earlier this year. 
The Dodd-Frank law allows banks at least four years to
bring proprietary trading into compliance, with a potential
extension of as many as three years, according to a timeline
prepared by Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., winning its
first job managing a share sale by an Indian state-owned company,
may earn next to nothing for the privilege. 
The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
tied for the lowest bid among 17 banks vying to manage the
$1.8 billion offer by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.,
three people with knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. said they&#8217;d do the work for a fee
equal to 0.00000001 percent of the sale proceeds. That means the
firms stand to reap about 2 rupees (4 cents) each on the deal. 
The Indian government&#8217;s plan to sell a record 400 billion
rupees of assets this year is producing near-zero fees for Wall
Street firms that charge an average of about 4 percent of money
raised for U.S. offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. As
many as 20 banks still compete for each state sale, betting the
league-table credits will help them win more investment-banking
work in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. 
&#8220;They bet they can absorb any losses through other state
or private sector deals,&#8221; said Ashvin Parekh, head of financial
services for India at Ernst  Young LLP. 
Goldman Sachs is among U.S. banks seeking to make more of
their revenue in developing markets such as India as tougher
regulations and slower economic growth reduce opportunities in
the U.S. and Europe. David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief
financial officer, told analysts on July 20 that the firm is
investing more in faster-growing emerging markets after it
reported second-quarter net income plunged 82 percent. 
Lowest Fees 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and ICICI Securities Ltd. may earn
similar fees to manage Gurgaon-based Power Grid&#8217;s sale, the
people said. Banks must match the lowest fees to be hired under
government guidelines. 
S.K. Chaturvedi, chairman of Power Grid, India&#8217;s largest
electricity transmission company, declined to comment, as did
Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Seoul.
Spokespeople at the remaining banks also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs bid without success to manage offers from
state-owned Coal India Ltd. and Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. this
year. Both those sales may generate fees of 0.000001 percent for
underwriters including Citigroup Inc. and Edelweiss Capital Ltd.,
according to bankers with knowledge of the deals. 
New York-based Goldman Sachs, ranked second globally for
equity sales, is No. 23 in India, where the average fee is 0.7
percent, including offerings by private companies, according to
Bloomberg data. SBI Capital, the Mumbai-based investment banking
unit of India&#8217;s largest lender, is No. 13 on share sales in the
nation, while New York-based Citigroup is the top-ranked
arranger, the data show. 
Two Offers 
Citigroup, whose local investment-banking operations are
run by Ravi Kapoor, has managed two offers by state-owned
companies this year and 10 sales by private firms, Bloomberg
data show. Sunil Sanghai, who was co-head of investment banking
at Goldman Sachs along with Brooks Entwistle, quit in June. The
company hasn&#8217;t named a replacement yet. 
For state asset sales in India, rules governing the
selection of underwriters have helped squeeze fees. 
Bankers must have the lowest fees as well as the best

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, said second-quarter profit fell 14
percent on lower investment income and asset writedowns. 
Net income declined to 346 million euros ($457 million)
from 400 million euros a year earlier. That compared with the
353 million-euro average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Bloomberg calculated the company&#8217;s income by
subtracting published first-quarter figures from the first-half
results released today. 
In 2010, &#8220;the Group expects to report higher operating
margins and a rise in net profit compared with 2009,&#8221; the
Trieste, Italy-based company said in the statement. 
Profitability at insurers is under pressure as low interest
rates and turbulence in the stock market weigh on investment
returns, while flood claims and lower margins hurt their
property and casualty business. Cesare Geronzi, who was
appointed Generali&#8217;s new chairman in April, aims to boost growth
in emerging markets, including China and the Middle East, and in
eastern Europe to recover from the global financial crisis. 
It&#8217;s a &#8220;good set of numbers, with net profit in line with
our estimate,&#8221; Gruppo Banca Leonardo analysts wrote in a note
sent to clients. 
Generali posted 461 million euros of writedowns related to
equity holdings in the first half, according to a slide
presentation. Total writedowns in the period fell to 655 million
euros from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. 
The non-life business, which was affected by claims related
to natural catastrophes in France and central-eastern Europe,
recorded gross premiums in the period of 5.1 billion euros, up
from 5 billion euros a year earlier. The company&#8217;s combined
ratio, a measure of profitability, worsened to 98.8 percent in
the first half from 97.9 percent a year earlier. 
Generali&#8217;s gross premiums from life insurance rose 8
percent to 12.1 billion euros. 
Generali gained 0.6 percent to 15.93 euros at 3:50 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 24.68 billion euros.
The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index has risen 10 percent in
the past six months, compared with Generali&#8217;s 1 percent
increase. 
The insurer is due to hold a conference call on its results
at 4 p.m. local time.

Drugmakers led by Pfizer Inc. will 
soon gain access to a new testing system that can shrink by 
months to years the time needed to determine an experimental
drug&#8217;s safety, potentially adding millions of dollars in
research savings and revenue. 
Since 1938, U.S. regulators have required pharmaceutical
companies to test for toxicity using animal studies before
costly human testing begins. That can take months for most 
compounds, and years for cancer medicines. The new system, 
developed by three federal agencies, uses computers to test
products against human and animal cells, rather than living
creatures, to find chemical reactions linked to toxicity. 
Speeding approvals by just six months can lift net income
over the average 12.8-year, patent-protected sales life of a
typical product by 5.5 percent, based on the declining value of
the dollar over time, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The new
test, which may be available for use as early as next year, may 
also be more precise, helping eliminate more dangerous compounds. 
&#8220;The earlier you can kill a drug&#8221; that&#8217;s unsafe &#8220;the
more economic sense it makes,&#8221; said David Jacobson-Kram, Food
and Drug Administration executive director for pharmacology
and toxicology, in a telephone interview. His agency last month
teamed up with the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Institutes of Health in developing the system.

Morgan Stanley hired former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. analyst Francesca Tondi to join its equity research
team covering Italian and German banks in London. 
Francesca will start in mid-October as managing director,
said Sebastian Howell, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in London.
Her responsibilities won&#8217;t include Deutsche Bank AG, which is
covered by Huw van Steenis. 
Tondi resigned in July after more than 10 years at
JPMorgan, where she covered lenders including UniCredit SpA,
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Postbank AG and
Aareal Bank AG. 
Before JPMorgan, Tondi worked for Fitch Ratings as a
banking analyst, starting in 1998, and for KPMG&#8217;s financial
business division, starting in 1995. A native of Italy, Tondi
has a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics from Bocconi University in
Milan. 
Morgan Stanley also hired Henrik Schmidt as executive
director to cover Nordic banks in mid-July to reinforce the
research team, said Howell on the phone.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which makes
more money from trading than any other bank, estimates that 25
percent to 35 percent of its revenue comes from derivatives, a
spokesman said. 
The New York-based firm, whose executives have said that
they didn&#8217;t know how much of their money came from derivatives,
provided the information in response to a request from the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, spokesman Lucas van Praag
said. The Wall Street Journal reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s response
late yesterday on its website. 
Based on the firm&#8217;s 2009 revenue of $45.2 billion, the
estimate means derivatives may have provided $11.3 billion to
$15.8 billion of revenue last year. 
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told members of the
FCIC in a July 1 hearing that Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t keep
separate records on derivatives because they are &#8220;integrated&#8221;
into the firm&#8217;s cash trading business. Derivatives are contracts
whose value is derived from assets such as stocks, bonds,
currencies or commodities, or events such as changes in interest
rates or the weather. 
Tucker Warren, a spokesman for the FCIC, said today that he
wasn&#8217;t able to confirm that the commission had received the
information from Goldman Sachs. 
$49.1 Trillion 
Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to a June report
from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC
lists Goldman Sachs among the five banks that together account
for 97 percent of the derivatives held by U.S. banks. 
Goldman Sachs, which is the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, reported $11.8 billion in revenue from trading fixed-
income, currencies and commodities in the first half of the year
and $3.57 billion from trading equities in the
same period. Combined, the two categories accounted for 71
percent of the firm&#8217;s $21.6 billion in net revenue. 
Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC in July 2009 to
investigate the causes of the worst U.S. financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The panel, led by Chairman Phil Angelides
and Vice Chairman Bill Thomas, has until December to
report its findings to Congress.

Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and Hulu
LLC plan to make online advertisements less annoying and more
profitable -- by letting users choose which ones to watch. 
Starting next month, websites including MSNBC.com,
Yahoo.com and Hulu.com will begin letting consumers decide which
ads show up in the video clips they watch online. A research
study of the new Hulu-designed format led by Vivaki, the digital
arm of French advertising company Publicis Group SA, showed that
users were twice as likely to click an ad when given a choice
than when one was selected for them. 
&#8220;When you give people a choice they tend to love you
because you&#8217;re showing them respect,&#8221; said Beth Uyenco Shatto,
global research director at Microsoft&#8217;s ads unit. &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t
for advertising they wouldn&#8217;t be getting the content for free.&#8221; 
The new ad-selecting tool, called ASq, may step up
development of the $3.1 billion global video ads market, already
the fastest-growing part of online advertising, Bloomberg
Businessweek.com reported. While it may not end unwelcome
commercials for car insurance or weight-loss pills, it may help
websites command higher rates while letting marketers attract
more eyeballs and better target consumers. 
CBS.com, AOL.com and Discovery.com plan to start using ASq
in September and Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube is studying it. The new
offering would let the viewer of an online video choose from
three or more ads instead of a pre-roll clip. Yahoo and Hulu
plan to use it as does Microsoft&#8217;s MSNBC.com, which features
segments from the &#8220;Today&#8221; show, &#8220;NBC Nightly News&#8221; and
&#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; 
&#8220;We&#8217;re getting smarter about what makes more impactful
advertising,&#8221; said Uyenco Shatto. &#8220;The big aha! here is
understanding what makes a viewer choose a particular ad.&#8221; 
Online Ad Surge 
Online advertising is expected to rise 12 percent this year
to $61.8 billion worldwide from $55.2 billion in 2009, according
to New York-based researcher eMarketer. Although text ads on
search pages such as Google or Microsoft&#8217;s Bing remain the
dominant form of online advertising, video ads are growing fast,
eMarketer says. According to IDC, global online video ad
spending, which was $2.2 billion in 2009, will expand to $11.3
billion in 2014. 
YouTube, which has more than 1 billion views a day, says
the company is &#8220;doubling&#8221; its efforts to get more viewers for
its video ads. 
&#8220;We are always looking to develop new formats and features
that make them more interactive,&#8221; the company said. 
While online ads may be seen as disruptive, they foot the
bill for much of the Internet&#8217;s content. They are expected to
get better at targeting individual consumers. 
Fun and Engaging 
&#8220;Online is much more individualist than television so
targeting is extremely important and effective,&#8221; said Dean
Donaldson, director of media experience at MediaMind
Technologies Inc., a maker of software for digital ad campaigns. 
&#8220;People do like advertising if it&#8217;s fun and engaging and
that&#8217;s done by speaking to each user,&#8221; he said. 
Not everyone is convinced allowing users to choose ads will
benefit the industry. 
&#8220;If you only watch what you like then how will it broaden
your appeal?&#8221; said Richard Wheaton, managing director at Ogilvy
 Mather&#8217;s Neo digital media agency, which works with clients
including Cisco Systems Inc., Eastman Kodak Co., International
Business Machines Corp. and American Express Co. &#8220;Everybody
isn&#8217;t happy to be advertised at, but the more iPads I see the
more I want an iPad.&#8221; 
Wheaton said there&#8217;s a &#8220;real shortage&#8221; of quality of
video ads online because they are very expensive to shoot. 
Experimental 
For now, most online video ads are nothing more than TV
commercials posted on the Internet, said David Hallerman, an
advertising analyst at eMarketer. 
&#8220;The whole online video space is still experimental for
most advertisers and websites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It definitely will
be growing, though search still remains No.1 in terms of dollars
spent and will remain dominant.&#8221; 
An estimated 9 percent of ads online are &#8220;touched&#8221; by a
user&#8217;s mouse for an average 43 seconds, Donaldson said. The
touch-time grows by 2 percent to 3 percent if the ad is a video. 
Blinkx Plc, an online video-search operator spun off by
Autonomy Corp., is among companies that stand to benefit from
the expected surge in video ads, said Chief Executive Officer
Suranga Chandratillake. 
The site, which gets 99 percent of its revenue from
advertising and was rated by ComScore as the fastest-growing
video site after Facebook, targets consumers with ads using
software that analyzes words and visual signs. Users can even
choose their own endings to some video ads. 
Samsung 3-D 
Samsung Electronics Co. is using interactive ads in one of
its campaigns for 3-D television. The company took a projection
of the late-19th-century Beurs van Berlage building in Amsterdam
and pasted it into a YouTube page. The building then cracks,
butterflies emerge from it, and users are instructed to click on
as many butterflies as possible to win a free TV. 
&#8220;Video is emotive,&#8221; said Chandratillake. &#8220;Search is a
terrible place to do branded advertising. When you think of your
favorite ads, they are never Google search ads.&#8221; 
There are 150 million online video watchers in the U.S. and
double that in China, said Sean Finnegan, chief digital officer
at Starcom MediaVest Group, a media buying and communications
agency owned by Publicis. 
&#8220;The majority of brands we represent plan to increase
their allocation to online video this year and next,&#8221; he said. 
Starcom MediaVest was part of a research group put together
by Publicis&#8217;s Vivaki, along with Hulu, Microsoft and the others
to study the ASq model. The group included marketers such as
Allstate Corp., Applebee&#8217;s International Inc. and Capital One
Financial Corp. 
Eventually, video ads will become richer and accompany TV
audiences migrating online. They will have social and commercial
elements and target the right person at the right time, said
Jonathan Nelson, Omnicom Group Inc.&#8217;s digital chief. 
&#8220;Video ads and interactive ads have lineage in TV;
extending that online is natural,&#8221; he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by
five computer-network technicians who claim the bank denied them
overtime pay for their work as contractors. 
The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified
damages, Goldman Sachs said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs contend they
deserve overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct was &#8220;willful and in bad faith,&#8221;
according to the technicians, who say the bank never paid them
overtime for work weeks that topped 70 hours. More than 100
employees in New York and New Jersey were underpaid as a result,
according to the lawsuit filed in May. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, disputed the allegations
in a July 16 filing, saying the technicians weren&#8217;t
&#8220;employees&#8221; as defined by the states&#8217; labor laws. About 25
percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s staff works on technology, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said earlier this year. 
&#8220;Technology is fundamental to everything we do, from
revenue-producing activities to enabling much of the control
infrastructure of the firm,&#8221; Viniar said in a presentation to
investors on Feb. 10. 
In July 2009, Goldman Sachs started including consultants
and temporary staff in quarterly employee numbers. The change
prompted the firm to revise its employee total to 29,800 at the
end of March 2009, up from 27,898 when the figure included only
full-time staff. 
The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10cv4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most revenue trading stocks and bonds, lost money
in that business on 10 days in the second quarter, ending a
three-month streak of loss-free days at the start of the year. 
Losses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading desks exceeded $100
million on three days during the period that ended June 30,
according to a filing today by the New York-based company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm also disclosed
that trading losses surpassed its value-at-risk estimate, a
measure of potential losses, on two days. 
Trading results across Wall Street firms declined after
Goldman Sachs and its biggest competitors posted perfect
results, with no losing days, in the first quarter. Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s $5.61 billion in second-quarter trading revenue exceeded
all its Wall Street competitors. The bank, overseen by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, relied on trading
for 71 percent of its revenue in the first half of the year,
down from 80 percent a year earlier. 
Today&#8217;s filing also shows that the firm&#8217;s traders generated
more than $100 million on 17 days during the quarter. Of the 65
days in the quarter, Goldman Sachs traders made money on 55
days, or 85 percent of the time.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley have invested almost $20 billion of their own money in
private-equity, private-debt, real-estate and hedge funds,
meaning they may each have to cut those stakes by more than 60
percent to comply with the so-called Volcker rule. 
Goldman Sachs had $15.4 billion in such investments as of
June 30, while Morgan Stanley had $4.22 billion, the New York-
based companies said today in regulatory filings. 
The Volcker rule limits a bank&#8217;s total investments in such
funds to 3 percent of its Tier 1 capital. That means Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley would have to reduce their stakes to
about $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, if the rule
were enforced today. U.S. banks may have as long as a dozen
years to cut their stakes under the financial-overhaul bill
President Barack Obama signed into law last month. 
&#8220;The regulators are likely to give them several years in
order to comply, so I think it will be a steady, slow process,&#8221;
said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic Equities
LLP. &#8220;I think they&#8217;ll find it fairly easy to sell those size
investments over a multiyear period.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in the filing that &#8220;substantially all&#8221;
of the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated within
10 years. Morgan Stanley said 46 percent of the fair value of
its private-equity funds and 49 percent of its real-estate funds
are likely to be liquidated in the next 10 years. 
Tier 1 
Goldman Sachs had $7.32 billion invested in private-equity
funds, $4.18 billion in private-debt funds, $3.02 billion in
hedge funds and $910 million in real-estate funds, according to
its filing. The bank&#8217;s Tier 1 capital was $68.5 billion. 
Morgan Stanley had a $1.59 billion investment in private-
equity funds, $1.75 billion in hedge funds and $887 million in
real-estate funds as of June 30, the bank said. Its Tier 1
capital rose to $53.5 billion. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s total stakes were down from $15.9 billion
as of Dec. 31, 2009, according to the filing. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
total stakes decreased from $4.62 billion as of March 31 and
$4.94 billion at Dec. 31, 2009, according to previous filings. 
Rules curbing banks&#8217; investments in their own funds would
take effect 15 months to two years after a law is passed,
according to the legislation. Banks would have two years to
comply, with the potential for three one-year extensions after
that. They could seek another five years for &#8220;illiquid&#8221; funds
such as private equity or real estate, according to a
presentation from law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP.

Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for Argentina&#8217;s 2010 economic growth to 9.7 percent from
4.6 percent because of increased agriculture production, exports
to Brazil and domestic consumption. 
Gross domestic product will expand 5.9 percent next year
compared with a previous forecast of 2.4 percent, the bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. This year&#8217;s growth rate will be
one of the fastest in Latin America, the bank said. 
&#8220;Argentina&#8217;s economy is in the midst of a scorching
recovery,&#8221; Morgan Stanley economist Daniel Volberg wrote in the
report. &#8220;The stronger growth outlook implies stronger fiscal
results and more manageable financing over the next 15 months.&#8221; 
Argentina&#8217;s economy, South America&#8217;s largest after Brazil,
is recovering from a slump that cut economic growth to
0.9 percent in 2009, the slowest since the country pulled out of
a recession in 2003. GDP rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the fastest pace in two years. Economy
Minister Amado Boudou last week said the economy will expand
7 percent this year. 
Argentina&#8217;s fiscal deficit will be 0.1 percent of GDP this
year, compared with an earlier estimate of a 1 percent deficit,
Morgan Stanley said. 
Boudou said on Aug. 4 that Argentina has &#8220;no financial
urgency&#8221; to tap international credit markets after the country
last month restructured $12.9 billion in defaulted debt tied to
its 2001 default on $95 billion of bonds.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to 1,200
from 1,250 and reduced its 2011 earnings projection, citing
weakening economic forecasts. 
SP 500 companies will post combined profit of $89 a share
next year, compared with Goldman Sachs&#8217; prior estimate of $93,
according to David Kostin, the New York-based equity strategist.
Jan Hatzius, the firm&#8217;s chief U.S. economist, lowered his
prediction for 2011 growth in gross domestic product to 1.9
percent from 2.4 percent on Aug. 6. 
&#8220;The weak GDP growth forecast and specter of deflation
means top-line sales increases will be hard to achieve,&#8221; Kostin
wrote today in a note to clients. He raised his 2010 earnings
forecast for the SP 500 to $81 a share from $78. 
The SP 500 has rallied 9.7 percent since July 2 as profit
growth that exceeded analyst estimates helped overcome concern
the economy will slip into the second recession in three years.
Growth in the U.S. slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, less than forecast, reflecting an easing in
consumer spending, according to Commerce Department data. 
Before today, the average estimate of 12 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg called for the SP 500 to rise 20 percent
in the last six months of 2010 to 1,242. U.S. earnings will
increase 35 percent in 2010, the biggest annual gain since 1988,
more than 8,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. 
The Federal Reserve may return to &#8220;unconventional&#8221; monetary
stimulus as early as this week&#8217;s policy meeting as the U.S.
economy continues to lose momentum, economists led by Hatzius
wrote Aug. 6. The firm raised its estimate for the jobless rate
as growth slows and the &#8220;reacceleration in U.S. output&#8221; expected
for 2011 is made more doubtful by congressional resistance to
fiscal stimulus, the note said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecasts for the world&#8217;s two largest economies on signs
that stimulus boosts will wane. 
Japan will grow 1.4 percent in 2011, compared with an
earlier forecast of a 1.7 percent expansion, Tokyo-based senior
economist Chiwoong Lee said in a report dated Aug. 7. Goldman
last week lowered its projection of U.S. growth for the same
year to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent. 
A report today showed Japan&#8217;s current-account surplus
narrowed for a second month as export gains cooled, adding to
concerns that the recovery is losing steam. Government
incentives that have bolstered spending at home are wearing off,
with economists forecasting second quarter gross domestic
product grew at half the pace of the previous period. 
&#8220;We expect signs that growth is slowing to gradually
emerge in line with the disappearance of the government stimulus
boost both in Japan and abroad,&#8221; Lee wrote in a separate report
dated today. &#8220;The U.S. economic recovery has lost a
considerable amount of its momentum.&#8221; 
Japan will experience a &#8220;significant falloff&#8221; in consumer
spending, which has so far been propped up by government
measures, according to Lee. He noted that there is &#8220;little
chance&#8221; Prime Minister Naoto Kan will extend a program
scheduled to expire in December that encourages household to buy
energy-efficient electronics. 
Seven-Month High 
Japan&#8217;s jobless rate is at a seven-month high and factory
output fell in June. The GDP report due Aug. 16 may show that
the expansion moderated to an annualized 2.1 percent from 5
percent in the previous quarter, according to the median
estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. 
Lee said Japan&#8217;s export gains are already losing steam and
will be &#8220;sluggish&#8221; in 2011 given a worsened outlook for the
expansion in the U.S. 
U.S. growth will be slower in 2011 because of lawmakers&#8217;
resistance to extend several stimulus measures, Lee said. The
unemployment rate, which was at 9.5 percent in July, may climb
to 10 percent &#8220;by early 2011,&#8221; he said. That may prompt the
Federal Reserve to return to &#8220;unconventional monetary easing,&#8221;
such as increasing its purchases of Treasuries, he added.

Chicago drivers will pay a Morgan
Stanley-led partnership at least $11.6 billion to park at city
meters over the next 75 years, 10 times what Mayor Richard Daley
got when he leased the system to investors in 2008. 
 Morgan Stanley, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Allianz
Capital Partners may earn a profit of $9.58 billion before
interest, taxes and depreciation, according to documents for a
$500 million private note sale by their Chicago Parking Meters
LLC venture. That is equivalent to 80 cents per dollar of
projected revenue. Standard Parking Corp., which runs 30,000
spaces at the city&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare and Midway airports, earned 4.84
cents on that basis last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
The deal illustrates how Wall Street banks, recipients of
more than $300 billion in taxpayer bailouts in the worst credit
collapse since the Great Depression, are profiting from helping
states and cities close record recession-induced deficits by
selling bonds and leasing public properties. Chicago gave up
billions of dollars in revenue when it announced in 2008 that it
leased Morgan Stanley its 36,000 parking meters, the third-
largest U.S. system, for $1.15 billion to balance its budget,
said Alderman Scott Waguespack. 
While Chicago has the right to &#8220;repossess and assume
operational control&#8221; of the meters if the Morgan Stanley
partners default on their obligations, the bond document says,
the contract doesn&#8217;t expire until 2084. &#8220;The next couple of
generations will pay the price,&#8221; said Waguespack, 40, a
Democrat from the 32nd Ward. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s despicable, the way it went down,&#8221; said Waguespack,
one of only five aldermen among 50 who voted against the lease. 
Midway Airport 
Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and other
cities may follow Chicago in selling future parking revenue for
cash to help fill budget holes, according to the Reason
Foundation, a Los Angeles-based researcher that advocates
public-private partnerships. Chicago may also lease Midway
International Airport, a regional hub 10 miles from downtown. 
When Daley, a 68-year-old Democrat who took office in 1989,
announced the parking deal on Dec. 2, 2008, two days before the
council&#8217;s vote, Waguespack&#8217;s staff estimated the city would give
up $4 billion to $5 billion of revenue in exchange for the
upfront sum. Last month, the private partners&#8217; debt-sale
memorandum projected revenue over the 75-year lease would be
$11.6 billion.

Liverpool, the soccer club that last
season had its worst Premier League performance in 11 years, is
attracting gamblers for the new campaign. 
Even after finishing seventh, the team is being backed by
the highest number of bettors at U.K. and Irish bookmakers. The
season starts Aug. 14, with Liverpool hosting Arsenal a day
later. 
An 18-time winner of England&#8217;s top league, Liverpool has
attracted about a fifth of the total number of bets made with
Ladbrokes Plc and Paddy Power Plc, the bookmakers say. At 12-1
the Reds are the fifth favorite to win the league, so a
successful 1-pound ($1.58) bet would bring in 12 pounds plus the
original stake. 
&#8220;All fans are optimistic, and then there are Liverpool
fans,&#8221; Paddy Power spokesman Darren Haines said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The eternal optimists who always think it&#8217;s going
to be their year. It&#8217;s been a long time since Liverpool has been
12-1. They may also be tempted by the takeover rumors.&#8221; 
The five-time European champion, which last won the
domestic league in 1990, failed to qualify for this season&#8217;s
Champions League and is the subject of media speculation about a
possible takeover. 
A change of ownership before the end of August could hand
new manager Roy Hodgson tens of millions of pounds to bolster
his squad. He&#8217;s already added Joe Cole and retained Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres amid speculation they might leave. 
&#8220;Punters are tipping Liverpool to turn the corner with Roy
Hodgson,&#8221; Ladbrokes spokesman Nick Weinberg said. 
Worst-Case Scenarios 
Ahead of Liverpool in Ladbrokes&#8217; odds are defending
champion Chelsea, the favorite at 13-8, Manchester United (9-4),
Manchester City (5-1) and Arsenal (6-1). 
Of the &#8220;realistic contenders,&#8221; Arsenal alarms Paddy Power
the most. 
&#8220;In terms of money, it&#8217;s significantly more than anyone
else. They are probably the realistic team that we currently
fear the most,&#8221; Haines said. To date, the club has attracted
the company&#8217;s largest bet, with 4,500 pounds ventured at 6-1. 
A Liverpool triumph would be Ladbrokes&#8217; worst result.
&#8220;We&#8217;re quite happy laying them at 12-1 but that&#8217;s not to say we
wouldn&#8217;t get a bit nervy if they start quite well,&#8221; Weinberg
said. The club carries the bookmaker&#8217;s largest bet at 10,000
pounds, which could cost it 120,000 pounds. 
A title-winning season for Liverpool&#8217;s city rival Everton
is currently the worst-case scenario for Paddy Power, although
at 150-1 the company is &#8220;quite comfortable with that,&#8221; Haines
said. 
Spurs, City 
Betting for this season has been &#8220;well up&#8221; on last year
for Paddy Power with the emergence of Tottenham Hotspur (33-1)
and Manchester City, fourth and fifth last season, making the
market more competitive. The two sides meet at White Hart Lane
in London in three days. 
Both Ladbrokes and Paddy Power expect a large increase in
bets, particularly on Manchester United and Chelsea, as the week
progresses. A growth in football bets is partially offsetting a
decline gambling on horseracing, which attracts the largest
proportion of bettors, said Greg Johnson, an analyst for
Liverpool-based Shore Capital Group. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a struggle out there, it&#8217;s certainly
sluggish,&#8221; Johnson said in a phone interview. &#8220;I would have
thought that they would be looking to the football season with
some excitement.&#8221; 
The Premier League is becoming more surprising with those
at the top becoming weaker, Johnson said. &#8220;You&#8217;re more likely
to get more draws and less predictable results, which is how the
bookies make the money.&#8221; 
Houses Painted Orange 
Premiership newcomer Blackpool has the longest odds in the
league at 5,000-1. Earlier this week, just 51 bets had been
placed with Paddy Power on the Lancashire team, known as the
Seasiders or Tangerines because of their orange jerseys. 
&#8220;It would be our second-worst result after Everton&#8221; if
Blackpool were to win the league, Haines said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure
who these 51 people are but I suspect their houses are painted
orange.&#8221; The largest bet on Blackpool is 10 pounds, resulting
in a payout of 50,000 pounds if it finishes first. 
Home loyalties often sway bettors living in the area of
newly promoted teams, such as Blackpool, Newcastle United and
West Bromwich Albion. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see punters in that particular area come in and
have a pound on their side&#8221; to win the title, Weinberg said.
&#8220;Just to say that they&#8217;ve done it and then go show their mates
down the pub.&#8221; 
The same can&#8217;t be said for 1,000-1 shot Bolton Wanderers,
who have elicited the lowest level of interest from Paddy Power
customers. The &#8220;almost invisible man of the Premier League,&#8221;
also based in Lancashire, has attracted five bets, Haines said.

Desiree Rogers, the former White
House social secretary who resigned in February after a Virginia
couple crashed a state dinner, has been named chief executive
officer of the world&#8217;s largest black-owned publishing company. 
Linda Johnson Rice, who was chairman and CEO, will continue
as chairman, Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Company, which
includes Jet and Ebony magazines among its titles, said today in
a statement. 
&#8220;Desiree has a proven track record of successful business

Rogers is a longtime Chicago friend of President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. She was the first black
social secretary at the White House. Rogers was president of
Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, the natural-gas operating
subsidiaries of Peoples Energy Corp., from 2004 to 2008, and an
executive at insurer Allstate Corp. 
In her White House role, Rogers brought a variety of events
to the executive mansion, organizing a luau for members of
Congress, a poetry jam and jazz performances. She also kept a
higher profile than past social secretaries, posing for a spread
in Vogue and in WSJ, the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s magazine. 
&#8216;Obama Brand&#8217; 
Her use of the phrase &#8220;Obama Brand&#8221; in the WSJ article
concerned some in the White House, Rogers said in an April
appearance in Chicago, adding that she &#8220;could have&#8221; used more
appropriate language. 
&#8220;That is the thing that you have to keep in mind,
particularly when you are talking about the White House and the
presidency,&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;You need to select words that your
audience, you know, understands in the way you want them to
understand it.&#8221; 
Rogers gained national attention after the first state
dinner of Obama&#8217;s presidency, a Nov. 24 affair in honor of
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, when Virginians Tareq and
Michaele Salahi managed to get into the event without being on
the official guest list. An internal review later revealed that
a third person also got into the event uninvited. 
The Secret Service took responsibility for the security
lapse, and the Obama administration said it would change
procedures so that a staff member is posted at White House
entrance gates to help screen guests. 
Obama Displeased 
The president also expressed his displeasure. 
&#8220;I was unhappy with everybody who was involved in the
process,&#8221; Obama said in December. &#8220;It was a screw-up.&#8221; 
Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who was Obama&#8217;s
national finance director during the 2008 presidential campaign,
now has the social secretary job. 
Rogers, a New Orleans native and former queen of the Zulu
Mardi Gras krewe, was a prominent name in Chicago&#8217;s social,
business and philanthropic scenes before she was picked to be
the White House social secretary. 
She met the Obamas through her ex-husband, John Rogers Jr.,
the chairman of Chicago-based Ariel Investments LLC. He was an
early Obama fundraiser who played basketball at Princeton
University with Michelle Obama&#8217;s brother, Craig Robinson. 
Rogers, who studied political science at Wellesley College
in Massachusetts and earned a Harvard MBA, had her first highly
visible post as the Illinois lottery director, a job that
included Chicago television appearances where she gave away pots
of money. 
&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to blossom,&#8221; Rogers said in April.
&#8220;The whole experience in many respects is going to make me feel
more comfortable about who I am.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
media company, reported third-quarter sales and profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates on gains at the ESPN sports channel and a
rebound at the film studio led by &#8220;Toy Story 3.&#8221; 
Net income rose 40 percent to $1.33 billion, or 67 cents a
share, from $954 million, or 51 cents, a year ago, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Sales gained
16 percent to $10 billion in the period ended July 3, exceeding
the $9.34 billion average of 16 analysts&#8217; estimates. 
ESPN recognized deferred revenue sooner, and the company&#8217;s
Marvel and Pixar studios enjoyed box-office successes with two
films in the period. &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; and &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; have
generated more than $300 million each at U.S. and Canadian
theaters. 
&#8220;ESPN should see some good growth as the automotive
industry returns to advertising,&#8221; Tony Wible, an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said before results
were announced. He has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Profit beat the 59-cent average of 19 estimates. 
Disney gained 51 cents to $35.80 in extended trading. The
stock added 13 cents to $35.29 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading and has gained 9.4 percent this year. 
Cable Profit 
Operating profit at the media networks division increased
43 percent to $1.89 billion on $4.73 billion in revenue. Within
the division, cable properties contributed $1.68 billion in
operating profit, buoyed by $344 million of previously deferred
revenue at ESPN, advertising gains and affiliate fees. 
The National Basketball Association finals between the Los
Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics drew record audiences to
ABC and ESPN. The two networks also carried World Cup soccer. 
Profit at Disney&#8217;s theme parks dropped 8.4 percent to $477
million on sales that rose 2.9 percent to $2.83 billion. The
company raised U.S. ticket prices on Aug. 5. 
Studio operating profit of $123 million compared with a
loss of $12 million a year ago, while revenue gained 30 percent
to $1.64 billion. Worldwide, &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; collected $895.6
million in ticket sales, while &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; garnered $621.4
million, according to Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s Box Office Mojo. 
&#8220;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,&#8221; which cost $200
million to produce and racked up $328.3 million in worldwide
ticket sales since its May 28 release, was a disappointment,
according to Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital
in New York. 
&#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; also helped drive Disney&#8217;s consumer
product sales, with revenue advancing 19 percent to $606 million
and operating profit increasing 22 percent to $117 million. The
company&#8217;s interactive division, which includes video games, lost
$65 million on sales of $197 million. 
Investors want to learn more about Disney&#8217;s plans for the
recently purchased online video-game companies Playdom and
Tapulous, DiClemente wrote today in a note. Disney may also
update investors on talks with Time Warner Cable Inc. over
retransmission rights to its television networks.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Michael Wise from Morgan Stanley as a partner to run the team
that helps manage equity offerings for financial institutions in
the Americas. 
Wise, 52, will start in New York in November, according to
an internal memo sent to employees by John S. Weinberg and David M. Solomon, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-heads of investment banking. Wise
succeeds Stuart Bernstein, who now oversees investment banking
for clean technology and renewable energy companies. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed the contents
of the memo and declined to comment further. Wise declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, ranks fourth this year among managers of U.S.
equity and equity-linked offerings compared with second-place
Morgan Stanley, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wise,
who was most recently chairman of equity capital markets at
Morgan Stanley, will report to Stephen Pierce, who runs the
equity capital markets division in the Americas. 
Wise, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1997, covered media and
communications and then U.S. financial institutions for the
equity capital markets division at the firm. He later because
co-head of financial institutions global capital markets and
then co-head of equity capital markets in the Americas. 
Goldman Sachs generated $593 million in revenue from equity
underwriting in the first six months of 2010, compared with $533
million at Morgan Stanley, according to company filings. Both
firms lag behind industry leader JPMorgan Chase  Co., which
reaped $767 million in the first six months of the year from the
business, and Bank of America Corp., which made $662 million,
filings show. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s hire on
its website yesterday.

Merrill Lynch  Co., the brokerage
unit of Bank of America Corp., won a U.S. judge&#8217;s ruling denying
a bid by 17 black financial advisers for group status in their
five-year-old discrimination lawsuit. 
Broker George McReynolds of Nashville, Tennessee, sued in
2005, alleging Merrill Lynch&#8217;s practices and procedures favored
white financial advisers over their black counterparts,
impairing their ability to make comparable incomes. 
U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman in Chicago on Aug.
5 rejected the bid by McReynolds and 16 other advisers for
certification of the case as a class action, or group, lawsuit. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; statistical evidence alone is insufficient to
establish companywide discrimination&#8221; affecting each member of
the proposed class the same way, the judge said. Each individual
group member&#8217;s claim must be tried before a jury, Gettleman
said. 
McReynolds, along with the plaintiffs who joined the case
after he filed it, sought to represent about 700 advisers and
trainees who had worked in the firm&#8217;s Global Private Client unit
from January 2001 until now, according Gettleman&#8217;s decision. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the
largest U.S. bank by assets, acquired New York-based Merrill
Lynch last year for about $33 billion in stock. 
Linda Friedman, a lawyer for the advisers, said she would
ask a federal appeals court for permission to seek review of the
ruling. 
&#8220;I continue to believe that a class action is the only way
to rid Wall Street of this horrific discrimination,&#8221; said
Friedman, a partner at Stowell  Friedman Ltd. in Chicago.
&#8220;However, the individuals who brought this lawsuit have no
intention of dropping it.&#8221; 
If Gettleman&#8217;s ruling stands, there could be as many as 200
trials, Friedman said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the court&#8217;s ruling,&#8221; Bank of America
spokesman William Halldin said in a phone interview. He declined
to comment further. 
The case is McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner 
Smith Inc., 05-cv-06583, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Illinois (Chicago). 
Lehman, HSBC May Be Sued Over Worthless &#8216;Minibonds&#8217; 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc may be
sued over $1.6 billion in worthless securities sold to retail
investors, primarily in Hong Kong, a judge in New York ruled. 
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III yesterday
reversed part of a decision by Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy judge, who
threw out a suit by seven holders of structured financial notes
called minibonds. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of
investors in the notes from June 16, 2003, to Sept. 15, 2008,
Pauley said in his decision. 
Pacific International Finance Ltd. issued the minibonds and
marketed them as linked to the credit of financially sound
companies and backed by AAA-rated collateral, Pauley said. The
minibonds became worthless as a result of the collapse of Lehman
Brothers, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008. 
A Hong Kong regulatory authority investigation disclosed
that Lehman designed the minibonds program and used Pacific
Finance to issue them, Pauley said. Lehman selected HSBC Bank
USA as trustee of the collateral securing the notes, Pauley
said, citing testimony in the Hong Kong proceeding. 
In two orders, issued in November and December, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck ruled that the plaintiffs lacked
standing to sue and that any attempt to revise their complaint
would be futile. 
In yesterday&#8217;s ruling, Pauley reversed the dismissal of one
count against HSBC and Lehman and permitted the plaintiffs to
amend two dismissed counts. 
Neil Brazil, an HSBC spokesman, said the firm had no
immediate comment on the ruling. Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman
spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message seeking comment. 
The case is Wong v. HSBC USA Inc., 10-cv-00017, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Madoff Judge Erred in Fake Profit Ruling, Court Told 
Customers defrauded by Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme
deserve repayment of as much as $500,000 each, even if they took
out more than they put into his investment business, a lawyer
argued yesterday to an appeals court. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland erred when he ruled in
March that the Securities Investor Protection Corp. doesn&#8217;t
offer insurance to investors, and that Madoff customers can only
collect from SIPC if they put in more cash than they took out
from his business, attorney Helen Chaitman argued in a brief. 
Chaitman, who represents 700 investors, asked the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New York to reverse Lifland and rule that
SIPC trustee Irving Picard should review claims based on final
account statements in December 2008 that included fake profit
from the fraud. Those investors say they had no knowledge of the
fraud at New York-based Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC. 
&#8220;Appellants are, typically, people in their 70s, 80s or
90s, whose assets, other than their homes, were invested in
BLMIS&#8221; and face &#8220;serious medical issues,&#8221; Chaitman wrote in
yesterday&#8217;s filing. &#8220;They live in constant fear that the
trustee will sue them for the amount they withdrew from BLMIS in
excess of their investments.&#8221; 
Those investors are among more than 2,500 Madoff customers
who couldn&#8217;t collect any SIPC money under Lifland&#8217;s ruling,
which Picard sought. Picard, who is overseeing the liquidation
of Madoff&#8217;s business, has allowed more than 2,100 claims to
proceed.     Madoff, 72, who pleaded guilty last year, is
serving a 150-year sentence for running the largest Ponzi scheme
in U.S. history. Prosecutors said that Madoff falsely told
investors that they profited from stock trades that never took
place. 
Picard, hired by SIPC to repay victims of the fraud, has
said that using account statements to set claims would let
Madoff decide who gets what, and include profit from trades that
didn&#8217;t really happen. 
Victims wanted their final account statements from Madoff&#8217;s
firm to determine the size of their claims. They had argued to
Lifland that SIPC was required to base claims on customers&#8217;
legitimate expectations. Lifland disagreed, ruling the account
statements were &#8220;entirely fictitious.&#8221; 
The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

SEC, Goldman&#8217;s Tourre Had Preliminary Talks, Agency Lawyer Says 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive director Fabrice Tourre
had &#8220;very preliminary&#8221; talks with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to settle the agency&#8217;s civil fraud claims
against him, an SEC lawyer said. 
&#8220;I would characterize us as having very preliminary
discussions along those lines a while back, and that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
SEC lawyer Lorin Reisner said in a hearing yesterday in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April, over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains in the case after the firm
agreed to a $550 million settlement last month. 
The settlement includes a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a
Wall Street firm, the SEC said. Goldman Sachs acknowledged it
made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that marketing materials for the
instruments had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221; the agency said. 
U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan granted
final approval to the settlement on July 20. 
Jones&#8217;s approval of the accord came a day after Tourre
filed court papers asking her to dismiss the lawsuit against
him. Tourre denied making any materially misleading statements
or omissions related to the sale of Abacus 2007-AC1 CDOs linked
to subprime mortgages. 
In the hearing yesterday, before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Michael Dolinger, the parties discussed possible outlines for
pretrial discovery in the case. Reisner said the SEC is turning
over 9 million pages of investigative documents to Tourre&#8217;s
lawyers. He said the agency may seek to take pretrial testimony
from 25 witnesses. 
Pamela Chepiga, one of Tourre&#8217;s lawyers, said Tourre may
seek to take testimony from as many as 50 witnesses. Chepiga
said the parties may also need to pursue evidence in the U.K.
and Germany in addition to the U.S. 
Dolinger set an Oct. 4 hearing to discuss the progress of
discovery in the case. 
The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
BP and U.S. Agree on Oil Spill Compensation Fund 
The U.S. completed negotiations with BP Plc over the
company&#8217;s agreement to establish a $20 billion fund to
compensate victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
according to the Justice Department. 
The negotiations followed an agreement made between the
London-based company and President Barack Obama on June 16. 
&#8220;We are pleased that BP made an initial contribution and
has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to
the president and the residents and business owners in the gulf
region,&#8221; said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli in a
statement yesterday. 
The fund, administered by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, doesn&#8217;t
cap BP&#8217;s liability for cleanup costs and economic damage, Obama
said in June, and it doesn&#8217;t supersede the rights of individuals
or states to sue the company.

New Suits 
Goldman Sachs Is Sued by Technicians for Overtime 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by five computer-network
technicians who claim the bank denied them overtime pay for
their work as contractors. 
The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified
damages, Goldman Sachs said yesterday in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs contend they
deserve overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct was &#8220;willful and in bad faith,&#8221;
according to the technicians, who say the bank never paid them
overtime for work weeks that topped 70 hours. More than 100
employees in New York and New Jersey were underpaid as a result,
according to the lawsuit filed in May. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, disputed the allegations
in a July 16 filing, saying the technicians weren&#8217;t
&#8220;employees&#8221; as defined by the states&#8217; labor laws. About 25
percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s staff works on technology, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said earlier this year. 
The case is Bardouille v. Goldman, Sachs  Co., 10cv4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
BP Accused of Air Pollution at Texas City Refinery 
A BP Plc unit allowed the emission of about 500,000 pounds
of air pollutants in violation of Texas environmental laws,
state Attorney General Greg Abbott alleged in a lawsuit. 
BP &#8220;admitted to the release of air contaminants to the
atmosphere&#8221; at its Texas City refinery after an April 6 fire on
part of a ultracracking unit, according to the complaint filed
yesterday in Austin, Texas. BP restarted the ultracracker and
another unit before repairing a compressor, sending benzene and
other pollutants into the air for about a month, the state said. 
&#8220;BP decided to continue those units so as not to reduce
productivity,&#8221; the state said in the complaint. &#8220;BP made very
little attempt to minimize the emission of air contaminants
caused by its actions, once again prioritizing profits over
environmental compliance.&#8221; 
The state also has a pending action over a release of
contaminants related to a 2005 explosion at the Texas City
refinery, Abbott said in a statement yesterday. That blast
killed 15 workers and led to a $50 million fine by the U.S. for
a violation of the federal Clean Water Act. 
BP &#8220;will continue to cooperate with the attorney general&#8217;s
office&#8221; and the Texas environmental quality agency &#8220;to resolve
their concerns,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. The company declined further comment on the
litigation, he said. 
The Texas lawsuit is State of Texas v. BP Products North
America Inc., District Court, Travis County, Texas. The class
action is Fontenot v. BP Products North America Inc., 3:10-cv-
295, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Galveston). 
BP Sued Over Gulf Oil Cleanup Chemicals, Sunday Telegraph Says 
BP Plc has been sued for the first time over alleged
environmental and health problems caused by chemicals used in
the Gulf of Mexico cleanup, the Sunday Telegraph reported. 
BP, based in London, sprayed 1.8 million gallons of Corexit
dispersant into the sea to break up the oil from the spill, the
newspaper reported Aug. 8. Two Gulf Coast residents, Glynis
Wright and Janille Turner, have filed a class action in Alabama,
alleging that the chemical is &#8220;four times more toxic than sweet
crude oil,&#8221; the newspaper said. 
The suit is also against Nalco Holding Co., Corexit&#8217;s
manufacturer, the Telegraph said. 
Robert Wine, a BP spokesman, declined to comment on the
lawsuit when reached by e-mail. He said the type of dispersants
used and the method employed were approved by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.

Cuomo Subpoenas Citigroup, JPMorgan in Health Probe 
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo expanded his health-
care credit card probe, which has included subpoenas to JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s Chase Health Advance, Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Citi Health
and CareCredit, a division of General Electric Co&#8217;s GE consumer
finance unit. 
Last week, Cuomo announced an investigation into what he
called &#8220;predatory health care lending&#8221; where consumers were
allegedly misled about financing terms for health-care credit
cards. 
&#8220;Our ongoing investigation has uncovered conflicts of
interest and predatory practices in the health care industry
that are hurting New Yorkers and patients across the country,&#8221;
Cuomo said yesterday in a statement. &#8220;Patients are being misled
into paying for services they never received by the people they
should be able to trust the most -- their doctors.&#8221; 
Cuomo said he has issued subpoenas to 14 dental and health
care clinics. The subpoenas seek marketing materials,
applications, terms of credit, and contracts. He claimed some
providers pressure consumers into using the card and are
rewarded with &#8220;kickbacks&#8221; in the form of rebates. 
Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang said in an e-mailed
statement that the bank will cooperate with Cuomo&#8217;s
investigation. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. 
Last week, GE spokesman Stephen White said the company was
looking forward to working with Cuomo&#8217;s office. 
Trials/Appeals 
Farrow Says Campbell Got &#8216;Huge Diamond&#8217; From Taylor 
Actress Mia Farrow said Naomi Campbell told her she
received a &#8220;huge diamond&#8221; from men sent by former Liberian
President Charles Taylor, contradicting the supermodel&#8217;s
testimony at a war-crimes tribunal last week. 
Campbell &#8220;said that in the night she had been awakened,
some men were knocking at the door and they had been sent by
Charles Taylor and had given her a huge diamond,&#8221; Farrow, 65,
said yesterday during the war-crimes trial of Taylor at the
Special Court for Sierra Leone in Leidschendam, the Netherlands. 
Campbell told the court last week that two strangers handed
her some &#8220;dirty looking stones&#8221; after a dinner at Nelson
Mandela&#8217;s home in South Africa in 1997. Campbell said she at
first didn&#8217;t know the stones were diamonds or who had given them
to her. Farrow said she hadn&#8217;t been shown any stones. 
Taylor, who is on trial for crimes against humanity during
the Sierra Leone civil war, has been accused by Chief Prosecutor
Brenda Hollis of giving the British model a diamond after the
Mandela dinner. Conflict diamonds, also known as blood diamonds,
have been used to fund wars throughout Africa. 
Taylor last year denied providing weapons to fighters in
the Revolutionary United Front, a Sierra Leone rebel movement,
in exchange for diamonds. The testimonies of Farrow and Carole
White, Campbell&#8217;s former agent, on the gift to the supermodel
may refute Taylor&#8217;s claim he never possessed rough diamonds. 
Ken Macdonald, a lawyer for Campbell, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s testimonies. 
Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 counts including
enlisting child soldiers, murder and sexual slavery during the
1991-2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. As many as 250,000 people
were killed in the conflict.

Dutch Prosecution Says Trafigura Fine Is Too Low 
The Dutch public prosecutor&#8217;s service appealed a ruling by
an Amsterdam district court against Trafigura Beheer BV for
shipping harmful waste to Ivory Coast, saying the fine of 1
million euros ($1.3 million) was too low. 
The prosecution can also prove that the closely held
commodities trader committed fraud, Esther Schreur, spokeswoman
for the Dutch National Fraud Prosecutor said, confirming an
earlier report by the newspaper De Volkskrant. 
&#8220;We vigorously deny all charges,&#8221; including fraud, said
Margaret van Kempen, an outside spokeswoman for Trafigura.
Trafigura has also appealed the ruling, she said. Ron van
Leeuwen, spokesman for the Amsterdam Appeals Court, said he
couldn&#8217;t yet confirm or deny the appeals. 
Waste from a ship hired by Trafigura four years ago was
given to a local company, Compagnie Tommy, and was dumped near
Ivory Coast&#8217;s commercial capital, Abidjan. Residents claimed the
pollution caused deaths and widespread illness.

Verdicts/Settlements 
AstraZeneca Settles Two-Thirds of Seroquel Lawsuits 
AstraZeneca Plc will pay about $198 million to settle
17,500 lawsuits, or about two-thirds of the total cases alleging
its antipsychotic drug Seroquel causes diabetes in some users. 
The settlements resulted from court-ordered mediation, the
London-based drugmaker said in a statement yesterday.
AstraZeneca previously agreed to pay at least $55 million to
resolve more than 5,500 cases alleging the company knew Seroquel
could cause diabetes and failed to adequately warn patients,
people familiar with those settlements said. These earlier
agreements are part of the 17,500 settlements, the company said. 
AstraZeneca, the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker, is closer
to wiping out the 26,000 total Seroquel cases and at a lower
cost than expected, analysts said. Average payments are $10,000
to $11,000 for former Seroquel users, according to previous
announcements and people familiar with earlier accords. The
settlements are &#8220;probably lower than the worse-case estimate,&#8221;
according to Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley
 Co Ltd. 
&#8220;While the terms remain confidential and are subject to
non-monetary agreements, we believe it was in the best interest
of the company to explore resolving these cases through the
mediation process,&#8221; Tony Jewell, AstraZeneca&#8217;s spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We remain committed to a strong
defense effort, but will also continue to participate in good
faith in court-ordered mediation.&#8221; 
Lawyers for the company and former Seroquel users met last
week with Stephen Saltzburg, a George Washington University Law
School professor who is the mediator in the case, the people
familiar said. Saltzburg said in a February court filing that
AstraZeneca faces as many as 26,000 suits over Seroquel and a
global settlement wasn&#8217;t likely. 
Company officials said earlier this month that lawyers for
other former Seroquel users are scheduled to meet Saltzburg to
see if their claims can be resolved. 
Ken Bailey, a Houston-based lawyer representing former
Seroquel users who hasn&#8217;t settled his cases, said he was
encouraged that AstraZeneca was willing to talk about resolving
patients&#8217; claims. 
Former Seroquel users contend research has shown patients
have developed diabetes while on the drug and AstraZeneca&#8217;s own
researchers acknowledged the link in internal documents. 
The consolidated Seroquel case is In re Seroquel Products
Litigation, 06-MD-01769, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Florida (Orlando).

Morgan Stanley was accused of taking
a profit for itself and failing to sell notes when it should
have in a lawsuit filed by nuns, a veterinary fund and 85 other
Irish investors. 
Morgan Stanley and Saturns Investments Europe Plc, a
special-purpose vehicle set up by the New York-based bank,
&#8220;deliberately or carelessly failed to redeem the notes&#8221; when
they were downgraded to junk in January 2009, according to a
statement by Stewarts Law LLP, the lawyers for the investors. 
The bank and Saturns waited until June 2009, after the
price of underlying bonds had risen significantly, to redeem the
notes, &#8220;thereby securing Morgan Stanley a profit of at least
$11.2 million on the sale of the notes by way of a termination
payment,&#8221; the lawyers said. The notes were sold to &#8220;a related
Morgan Stanley entity&#8221; at a profit, they said. 
The Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, the Holy Faith
Sisters, the Irish Veterinary Benevolent Fund and other
individual investors bought 5.88 million euros ($7.6 million) of
the notes through the stockbroker Bloxham in 2005 and 2006. The
investors filed the suit on Aug. 10 in London, according to
Stewarts Law. They are seeking damages of more than 15 million
euros. 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Michael Wang declined to comment. 
The case is The Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary v.
Morgan Stanley  Co, 2010/960, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s
Bench Division (London).

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drug company, sued Iceland&#8217;s Actavis Group hf asking a judge to
block sales of a generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor
until a patent expires in 2017. 
New York-based Pfizer contends Actavis has applied to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make copies of the drug in
violation of the 1999 patent, according to a complaint filed
today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed&#8221; if Actavis
markets its product before the patent-protection expires, Pfizer
lawyers said in the complaint, which also seeks legal fees and
expenses. 
Lipitor is the best-selling medicine worldwide, with sales
of $11.4 billion in 2009. Pfizer said July 6 it received
approval from the European Commission for a new chewable form of
Lipitor for children over age 10. 
Actavis spokeswoman Hjordis Arnadottir didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit
after Icelandic business hours today. 
Pfizer fell 43 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $16.14 at 2:38
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has

Johnson  Johnson sold $1.1 billion
of bonds at the lowest interest rates on record for 10-year and
30-year securities amid surging investor demand for the highest-
rated corporate debt. 
The drugmaker, in the first offering by a nonfinancial AAA
rated company in 15 months, sold $550 million of 2.95 percent,
10-year notes and the same amount of 4.5 percent, 30-year bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the lowest
coupons for those maturities on record, according to Citigroup
Inc. data going back to 1981. 
&#8220;Even though some faith in the rating agencies has been
blown, the triple-A is still sacred,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief
fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia. 
JJ, the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based maker of products
from Tylenol to Listerine, joined International Business
Machines Corp. and McDonald&#8217;s Corp. in selling corporate debt in
the last month at some of the lowest interest rates on record.
Corporate borrowing costs have fallen to the lowest levels in
more than seven years as Treasury yields plunge amid rising
investor concern that the economic recovery is faltering. 
The company&#8217;s 10-year debt yields 43 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, and the 30-year bonds pay a spread
of 68 basis points, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. 
&#8216;Weaker&#8217; Market 
&#8220;The corporate bond market is weaker than it was earlier
in the week,&#8221; said David Trahan, head of U.S. investment-grade
syndicate at Citigroup in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a testimony to the
strength of the JJ credit that they&#8217;re actually achieving these
credit spreads and hence these coupons in what is otherwise a
much softer environment.&#8221; 
JJ is one of only four nonfinancial U.S. companies with
the top credit grade from Standard  Poor&#8217;s. SP also ranks
Exxon Mobil Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, the same level it assigns to U.S.
government debt. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates JJ an
equivalent Aaa. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot of demand out there for a very high-
quality issuer,&#8221; Lon Erickson, managing director at Santa Fe,
New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, said today in
a telephone interview. &#8220;It makes a lot of sense for Johnson 
Johnson to come get this money.&#8221; 
Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the sale, JJ said in a prospectus
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bill Price, a
JJ spokesman, declined to comment beyond the filing. 
Lowered Forecast 
JJ issued the bonds after lowering its 2010 earnings
forecast last month following recalls of over-the-counter
medicine that cut into revenue. 
The drugmaker is being investigated by the U.S. House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee after withdrawing more
than 40 types of children&#8217;s drugs and recalling 500 lots of
pharmaceuticals including Rolaids, Motrin and some forms of
Tylenol because of possible contamination from a chemical on
packaging materials. 
The last debt sale by a nonfinancial company rated AAA by
SP came in May 2009, when Microsoft raised $3.75 billion in its
first bond sale, Bloomberg data show. 
In JJ&#8217;s most recent debt sale, it sold $900 million of
5.15 percent, 10-year notes that paid 103 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $700 million of 5.85 percent,
30-year bonds at a 113 basis-point spread in June 2008,
Bloomberg data show. 
Falling Yields 
The average investment-grade bond yield has fallen 66 basis
points to 3.921 percent since June 11, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields on investment-grade
corporate bonds touched 3.887 yesterday, the lowest since June
13, 2003, when they were 3.848 percent, index data show. 
The 10 lowest-yielding U.S. corporate new issues in history
were sold in the past 14 months, Deutsche Bank strategists led
by Jim Reid in London wrote in an Aug. 4 note. 
McDonald&#8217;s and Public Service Electric  Gas Co. both sold
10-year, 3.5 percent debt in the past month and Xcel Energy Inc.
sold 4.85 percent, 30-year bonds on Aug. 4, the previous record-
low coupons for those maturities, according to Citigroup data.
The $450 million offering by McDonald&#8217;s, the world&#8217;s largest
restaurant chain, on July 28 was the cheapest debt of that
maturity sold in the U.S. in at least 15 years, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data show. 
IBM Offering 
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, sold 1
percent, three-year notes on Aug. 2 that bear the lowest coupon
of the more than 3,400 securities in the Barclays Capital U.S.
Corporate Index of investment-grade company debt. SP assigns
McDonald&#8217;s a grade of A, five steps lower than JJ, and ranks
IBM A+, four steps lower. 
Thornburg Investment Management wasn&#8217;t &#8220;too excited&#8221;
about the offering, Erickson said. He cited a lack of
compensation for &#8220;outlier&#8221; events such as the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill that caused London-based BP Plc&#8217;s bonds to plunge. 
&#8220;BP probably could have priced like this last year, two
years ago and this year without the oil spill,&#8221; he said.
Johnson  Johnson is &#8220;a very high-quality company, usually runs
real smooth, but things come up. Drugs can have a problem, over-
the-counter medicines could get tainted, you just never know.&#8221;

General Motors Co., the automaker 61
percent owned by the U.S., is seeking to raise $12 billion to
$16 billion in an initial public offering, said a person
familiar with the plan. 
The more than 500-page document, called an S-1, is likely
to be filed tomorrow, though it may not happen until Monday,
said the person, who asked not to be named because the
discussions are private. The exact value of the offering may not
be fully detailed in the registration statement filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the person. 
The IPO would be the second-largest in U.S. history, behind
Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion initial offering in March 2008. The
share sale is also the first step in freeing the Detroit-based
automaker from government ownership, which Chief Executive
Officer Ed Whitacre has pushed for after GM&#8217;s $50 billion
taxpayer bailout in the wake of its bankruptcy in June 2009. 
&#8220;After the restructuring, I expect GM to once again be a
leading company on the U.S. stock market,&#8221; said Kim Yong Tae,
who helps manage $2.9 billion equivalent of assets at Yurie
Asset Management Co. in Seoul. &#8220;The U.S. government has shown a
strong will to revive GM. It&#8217;s a stock I want to add to my
portfolio.&#8221; 
Whitacre will be succeeded as CEO by director Dan Akerson
on Sept. 1 and as chairman at the end of the year, GM said
today. 
Credit Line 
GM has obtained a $5 billion revolving line of credit from
a group of at least 15 banks as of last night New York time,
said the person. More than half are named in the draft of the
document as underwriters, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Credit
Suisse Group AG. 
Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined to comment on
details of the IPO. 
&#8220;We will do an IPO when conditions are right for the
company and in the markets,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. 
GM today reported second-quarter net income of
$1.54 billion on higher sales in the U.S. and China. Earnings
before interest and taxes climbed to $2.03 billion from $1.82 in
the first three months of the year, the company said in a
statement. Revenue rose 44 percent from a year ago to $33.2
billion. 
The company reported $1.07 billion in first-quarter profit
in May, compared with a $5.98 billion loss a year earlier. 
Most of the shares offered would come from the U.S.
Treasury, the person said. The aim is to sell a fifth of the
government&#8217;s 304 million shares, two people familiar with the
plan said in June. That would reduce the Treasury&#8217;s holdings to
less than 50 percent. 
New Shares 
The automaker may sell a small number of new shares, the
person familiar with the plans said yesterday. The Canadian
government, the United Auto Workers union&#8217;s retiree medical
trust and the estate of the bankrupt predecessor General Motors
Corp. haven&#8217;t decided whether to participate in the IPO, the
person said. 
The document will describe the old GM, its restructuring in
bankruptcy and liabilities facing the new company, the person
said. 
GM reported its second quarter profit today, and industry
analysts are looking for strong results to set the stage for the
IPO even as consumer confidence wanes. 
&#8220;GM needs to be very careful about when to conduct the
IPO,&#8221; said Yuuki Sakurai, chief executive officer of Fukoku
Capital Management in Tokyo. &#8220;Can they convince investors to
buy shares when spending is dropping in the U.S. and they don&#8217;t
have leading-edge environmental technology?&#8221; 
Chevrolet Volt 
The largest U.S. automaker will introduce its Chevrolet
Volt electric-drive car later this year. The vehicle will
compete with models including Nissan Motor Co.&#8217;s Leaf electric
car and a planned plug-in version of Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s Prius
hybrid. 
General Motors Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on June 1, 2009, after posting $88 billion of losses
since 2004, the last year the company reported an annual profit.
General Motors Co. emerged 39 days later. 
Executives responded today to investor concerns about when
the company will break even in its European business, which lost
$666 million before interest and taxes in the first half, and
who will succeed Whitacre. 
Confidence in Europe 
The automaker expects to break even in Europe next year,
Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, said during an interview
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop.&#8221; 
&#8220;We still have confidence that we can achieve, let&#8217;s say,
break-even in Europe by next year and then profitability
thereafterwards,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re closing a plant. We&#8217;re
looking at changes in employee relationships, which will lower
our costs, and looking to really invest in the product range, as
well. That&#8217;s been very successful, that formula, here in North
America.&#8221; 
The other question is the company&#8217;s succession plan. The
company had not said who would lead GM after Whitacre, 68,
retires. Now that has been resolved. 
&#8220;Dan Akerson is one of the most exceptional executives in
the country and will serve both GM&#8217;s interests and our national
interest well,&#8221; said William E. Conway Jr., a founder of the
Carlyle Group, where Akerson had been a managing director. &#8220;He
has played an incredibly valuable role at Carlyle. We will miss
him.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. appointed
James P. Esposito, who worked in the debt capital markets unit,
to succeed Howard Schiller as chief operating officer of the
firm&#8217;s investment-banking division, according to an internal
memo. 
Esposito will report to David Solomon and John S. Weinberg,
co-heads of investment banking, who reported the change in the
memo to employees. The contents of the memo were confirmed by
Michael DuVally, a spokesman at the firm. Schiller is retiring. 
&#8220;Jim will focus on increasing global connectivity and
driving best business practices across products and regions,&#8221;
Solomon and Weinberg said in the memo. &#8220;In addition, Jim will
oversee the activities related to the division&#8217;s key day-to-day
operations.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking division, which includes
merger advisory and debt and equity underwriting, contributed 6
percent of the firm&#8217;s pretax earnings in the first half of 2010,
compared with 5 percent in the same period last year.
Esposito had been global head of the teams that help raise debt
financing for investment-grade borrowers, the public sector and
infrastructure projects. 
Jonathan Fine, managing director on the U.S. investment-
grade syndicate desk, will become head of the desk, DuVally
said. Fine was promoted to managing director in 2007. 
Esposito, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 in emerging-
markets sales, will continue to serve the financing needs of
some large global clients, the memo said. He became a managing
director in 2002 and a partner in 2006. 
Dow Jones Newswires reported Esposito&#8217;s new role and Fine&#8217;s
promotion earlier today.

General Motors Co., 61 percent owned
by the U.S. government, reported second-quarter net income of
$1.54 billion on increased vehicle sales and production as the
Detroit automaker prepares for an initial public offering. 
Profit rose 44 percent from $1.07 billion in the first
three months of the year. Revenue increased 44 percent from a
year ago to $33.2 billion on growing sales of the Buick Excelle
in China and Chevrolet Equinox in the U.S., the company said
today in a statement. Operations in Europe will continue to
improve, the company said.

automaker after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in July
2009. GM is seeking to raise $12 billion to $16 billion in the
offering, which would make it the second-largest in U.S.
history, said a person familiar with the plan. 
&#8220;They continue to head in the right direction, even if the
pace is plodding,&#8221; said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at IHS
Automotive in Lexington, Massachusetts. &#8220;At least they are
tracking as expected.&#8221; 
The automaker&#8217;s European operations continued to weigh on
GM&#8217;s overall results with a $160 million loss. The unit lost
$506 million in the first quarter. GM reported a $123 million
gain on the sale of Saab to Spyker Cars NV. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt it&#8217;s tougher in Europe,&#8221; said Joe Phillippi, principal of AutoTrends Inc., a consulting firm in
Short Hills, New Jersey. &#8220;GM is just going to have to be even
tougher.&#8221; 
Europe Next Year 
The automaker is &#8220;confident&#8221; it can break even in Europe
next year, Chris Liddell, GM&#8217;s chief financial officer, said
during an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop.&#8221; 
&#8220;We still have confidence that we can achieve, let&#8217;s say,
break-even in Europe by next year and then profitability
thereafterwards,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re closing a plant. We&#8217;re
looking at changes in employee relationships which will lower
our costs and looking to really invest in the product range, as
well. That&#8217;s been very successful, that formula, here in North
America.&#8221; 
GM&#8217;s North America operations had profits before interest
and taxes of $1.59 billion, a 31 percent increase from the first
quarter&#8217;s $1.2 billion. The company&#8217;s international operations
declined 44 percent to $672 million. 
GM&#8217;s sales in the U.S. rose 12 percent to 601,700 cars and
trucks during the second quarter from 535,400 a year earlier,
according to researcher Autodata Corp. The company increased its
U.S. customer discounts in the second quarter by an average of
7 percent per vehicle to $3,624, according to Autodata. 
Increasing Output 
GM said it built 731,000 vehicles in North America, an
85 percent increase from the same months last year. 
GM&#8217;s revenue and profit gains in the second quarter were
driven by an increase in output and higher productivity in its
plants. 
&#8220;Last year GM was shutting down plants when they filed&#8221;
Chapter 11, said Wall, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
&#8220;This summer, most of its U.S. plants were running full out.&#8221; 
Models such as the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and
Cadillac SRX are selling well and with higher profit margins
because GM lowered its costs in bankruptcy, Wall said. 
GM said it generated $3.85 billion in cash from operations,
up from $1.7 billion in the first quarter. GM ended June with
$32.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, including funds
in a Canadian medical trust escrow. 
Growth in China 
Through the first half of the year, GM&#8217;s China sales,
including those of its joint ventures, rose 49 percent to
1.2 million vehicles compared with last year, according to the
automaker. That exceeded the 1.1 million cars and trucks GM sold
in the U.S. in the year&#8217;s first half. 
Chevrolet brand sales more than doubled in the first half in
China, driven by strong sales of the Cruze small car. Buick
sales rose 29 percent, according to J.D. Power  Associates. GM
is the No. 2 seller in China, behind Germany&#8217;s Volkswagen,
according to J.D. Power. 
&#8220;GM went through a rough time last year, but they never
backed away from China,&#8221; said Tim Dunne, an analyst with J.D.
Power. &#8220;China provides the bulk of their revenue and profits
from Asia.&#8221; 
During the second quarter, GM finished repaying
$8.4 billion in U.S. and Canadian loans assumed as it emerged
from bankruptcy. 
Eager for IPO 
Whitacre has said he is eager for the U.S. government to
sell its 61 percent share of the automaker. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t like this label of Government Motors,&#8221; he said
last week. 
A more than 500-page document, called an S-1, is likely to
be filed tomorrow, though it may not happen until Monday, said
the person familiar with the plans. The exact value of the
offering may not be fully detailed in the filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the discussions are private. 
GM has obtained as much as $5 billion in a revolving line
of credit from a group of at least 15 banks as of last night New
York time, said the person. More than half are named in the
draft of the document as underwriters, including Morgan Stanley,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and
Credit Suisse Group AG. 
Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined to comment on
details of the IPO. 
The IPO would include a fifth of the U.S.&#8217;s shares, people
familiar with the plan have said, which would bring the
Treasury&#8217;s stake below 50 percent. 
Time is Now 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to get the money when the market is giving
it,&#8221; Shelly Lombard, debt analyst with New York-based Gimme
Credit, said in a telephone interview before the release. &#8220;Now
is the time for GM to do an IPO.&#8221; 
The UAW retiree medical fund now holds 17.5 percent of GM,
the Canadian government has 11.7 percent and debtors are left
with 10 percent. 
GM&#8217;s announcement this week that its board had changed the
rules of minimum ownership to call a special meeting to
25 percent from 15 percent was likely taken in preparation for
an IPO, said Logan Robinson, a distinguished visiting law
professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. 
&#8220;You want to get your takeover defense in place before you
go public,&#8221; said Robinson, a former general counsel at Delphi
Corp., where he worked on the auto supplier&#8217;s IPO and spinoff
from GM.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software company, is seeking a patent on a system that would
allow gestures to be used to input data to a computer. 
According to application 20100199228, which was published
in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Aug. 5,
the system includes a camera that captures gesture, and a
&#8220;gesture recognizer engine&#8221; to identify the significance of
the gesture. 
The system can read American Sign Language gestures, which
is a manual language used by the deaf in the U.S., according to
the application. It can be used with a prop such as a
conductor&#8217;s baton or a tennis racket. 
In addition to being used to generate words, gestures can
be used to indicate emotions or to control game activities,
according to the patent. 
Microsoft applied for the patent in February 2009 with the
assistance of Woodcock Washburn LLP of Philadelphia. 
Interpump Group Unit Sued Over Patent by Colorado Competitor 
A unit of Italy&#8217;s Interpump Group SpA was sued for patent
infringement by a Colorado competitor. 
The complaint, filed Aug. 4 in federal court in Beaumont,
Texas, accuses Interpump&#8217;s NLB Corp. of infringing two patents
for high-pressure nozzles for waterjet tools held by StoneAge
Inc. of Durango, Colorado. The tools are used to clean sewer
pipes and to bore through stone. 
According to court papers, NLB is a former StoneAge
customer now making its own products that infringe the patents.
StoneAge claims NLB&#8217;s Typhoon 10 nozzles use the patented
technology and design. 
In dispute are patents 7,635,096 and D617,870, which were
issued in December 2009 and June 2010, respectively. They cover
StoneAge&#8217;s Banshee line of products, the company said in its
court filings. 
StoneAge complained that NLB&#8217;s infringing products were
shown at a trade show in Louisville, Kentucky, in February, and
that NLB&#8217;s sales representatives are contacting StoneAge&#8217;s
European customers, offering the allegedly infringing Typhoon
devices. 
The company claims it has lost sales it would have made
&#8220;but for NLB&#8217;s infringement&#8221; and that it will continue to
suffer &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; if NLB continues to make and sell
infringing products. 
StoneAge asked the court for money damages, &#8220;no less than
a reasonable royalty,&#8221; and for an award of profits NLB gained
from its allegedly infringing products. The company also asked
for awards of attorney fees and litigation costs and a court
order barring NLB from future infringement of the patents. 
BLP didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. 
The company is represented by Brian A. Carpenter, Eric W.
Buether and Christopher M. Joe of Buether Joe  Carpenter LLC of
Dallas. 
The case is StoneAge Inc. v. NLB Corp., 1:10-cv-00460, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Beaumont). 
Pfizer Sues Iceland&#8217;s Actavis Over Lipitor Patent 
Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drug company, sued
Iceland&#8217;s Actavis Group hf asking a judge to block sales of a
generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor until its patent
5,969,156 expires in 2017. 
New York-based Pfizer contends Actavis has applied to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make copies of the drug in
violation of the 1999 patent, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed&#8221; if Actavis
markets its product before the patent-protection expires, Pfizer
lawyers said in the complaint, which also seeks legal fees and
expenses. 
Lipitor is the best-selling prescription drug worldwide,
with sales of $11.4 billion in 2009. Pfizer said July 6 it
received approval from the European Commission for a new
chewable form of Lipitor for children over age 10. 
Actavis spokeswoman Hjordis Arnadottir didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit
after Icelandic business hours yesterday. 
The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Actavis Group hf, 10CV675, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Copyright 
UBS Sued for Copying Oil Reports in Investor Research 
UBS AG&#8217;s U.K. unit was sued for allegedly copying articles
from oil and gas publications and reprinting them in the
investment research it distributed to clients. 
Energy Intelligence Group Inc., based in New York, said its
publications, which include International Oil Daily, World Gas
Intelligence and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, were copied by
UBS Ltd. at least 10 times during 2006 and 2007, according to
the lawsuit. 
Articles from Energy Intelligence or portions of them were
reprinted in UBS&#8217;s own investment research publication, Daily
Oil News, according to the suit filed in a London court last
month and made public this week. 
Last month in a similar scenario, Deutsche Bank AG research
analyst Pankaj Jha left after the bank told clients one of his
reports contained &#8220;significant similarities&#8221; to an article
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. 
In the UBS case, analyst Jon Rigby had a single-user
subscription for the Energy Intelligence publications beginning
as long as 10 years ago, according to the suit. Rigby, based in
London, is the global coordinator of the bank&#8217;s Daily Oil News
publication, which is distributed in at least 17 countries
including the U.S., U.K., Germany, Russia and China, Energy
Intelligence said. 
UBS, based in Zurich, has been copying the publications
&#8220;in a systematic manner over a long period of time for the
purposes of enhancing its profile and reputation amongst its
customers and potential customers,&#8221; according to the complaint.
&#8220;The defendant threatens and intends to repeat the acts of
infringement.&#8221; 
UBS spokesman Dominik von Arx declined to comment. 
The publisher&#8217;s suit seeks unspecified damages from UBS for
copyright infringement and an injunction to stop UBS and its
employees from copying the articles. 
&#8220;The acts of the defendant were carried out flagrantly and
in the belief that the benefit to be so gained far exceeded the
damages at risk,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Energy Intelligence charges subscribers an additional fee
to reproduce an article from one of its publications, according
to the lawsuit. The publisher said it was unable to determine
how many times UBS copied stories or &#8220;the full extent&#8221; to
which they were distributed. 
The bank showed &#8220;cynical disregard&#8221; by printing its own
copyright prohibiting the redistribution of the material on each
publication of Daily Oil News, according to Energy Intelligence. 
In the U.S., the Copyright Clearance Center in Danvers,
Massachusetts, licenses a wide range of written content for
business and other purposes. These licenses can include works
from academic and other specialty publishers. 
The case is Energy Intelligence Group v. UBS Ltd.,
HC10C02381, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division (London). 
Viacom Appeals YouTube Copyright-Infringement Ruling 
Viacom Inc., the owner of MTV Networks and Paramount
studios, is appealing a ruling that Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube video-
sharing website didn&#8217;t infringe Viacom copyrights. 
Viacom appealed the June decision to the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New York, according to a filing yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. 
U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube hadn&#8217;t
infringed Viacom&#8217;s copyrights because it&#8217;s protected by the
safe-harbor provision of the federal Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. The law states a service provider isn&#8217;t liable if
it removes infringing material when notified by the copyright
owner.

Trademark 
RadioShack Sues Former Iowa Licensee for Trademark Infringement 
RadioShack Corp., a chain of consumer electronic stores
based in Fort Worth, Texas, sued a former licensee for trademark
infringement. 
Somebody Cares Inc. of Fairfield, Iowa, is accused of
infringing RadioShack marks by continuing to operate a store
under the RadioShack designation one year after the license
agreement was terminated. 
According to the complaint filed Aug. 10 in federal court
in Iowa, Somebody Cares had a license from RadioShack from
August 2000 to August 2009. RadioShack said it warned Somebody
Cares to quit using the marks in October 2009. 
The letter to Somebody Cares, which is included in the
court filing, mentions that Somebody Cares was also offering its
franchise for sale on the Craigslist website, &#8220;which is not
possible, as you do not have a franchise.&#8221; 
RadioShack said the public is likely to be confused by
Somebody Care&#8217;s actions, and that its business, reputation and
goodwill are damaged. The Texas company asked the court to order
Somebody Cares to stop the alleged infringement, and the
destruction, at Somebody Cares&#8217; expense, of all offending signs
and other promotional material. 
Additionally, the company asked for money damages, and
requested that they be tripled. RadioShack also requested awards
of litigation costs and attorney fees. 
RadioShack is represented by Timothy J. Zarley of the
Zarley Law Firm Plc of Des Moines, Iowa. 
The case is RadioShack Corp. v. Somebody Cares Inc., 4:10-
cv-00367-REL-RAW, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Iowa
(Des Moines). 
Mile High Festival Promoters Seek Permission to Seize Fake Goods 
Promoters for Colorado&#8217;s Mile High Music Festival filed a
preemptive trademark infringement suit against vendors who would
sell unauthorized merchandise in the festival&#8217;s vicinity. 
The suit, filed Aug. 9 in federal court in Denver, accused
100 unidentified female defendants, 100 unidentified male
defendants and one unidentified company of selling counterfeit
T-shirts and other merchandise. These sales will damage the
authorized seller and confuse the public, according to the
complaint. 
The plaintiff is AEG Life - Rocky Mountains LLC of Denver,
which promotes the festival and sells festival merchandise. The
festival, which opens Aug. 13 at a park north of Denver, drew
more than 90,000 attendees in 2009, its second year of
existence, and AEG Life says it derived &#8220;substantial income&#8221;
from the sale of authorized festival merchandise. 
It asked the court for an order barring infringement of its
marks and for authorization for law enforcement officials and
agents of AEG to seize and deliver for destruction all
unauthorized merchandise sold in the vicinity of the arena. 
AEG also asked for money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. 
The festival promoter is represented by Cara R. Burns of
Hicks, Mims, Kaplan  Burns of Santa Monica, California. 
The firm represents many entertainment figures and events
with reference to licensed merchandise, including Aerosmith,
Toni Braxton, Coca-Cola Co, Walt Disney Co., Hard Rock Cafe,
Glenn Danzig, Don Henley, H.R. Giger, INXS, Judy Garland, Korn,
Lollapolloza, Mattel, Metallica, Morrissey, Nirvana, Paul Simon,
The Eagles, Thomas the Tank, Warner Bros., and Dwight Yocum
according to the Hicks, Mims website. 
The case is AEG Live - Rocky Mountains LLC, v. John Does,

(Denver). 
Trafficker in Fake Trojan Condoms Gets 37 Months in Prison 
A U.S. immigrant from China was sentenced to 37 months in
prison for trafficking in more than a million counterfeit Church
 Dwight Co. Trojan condoms. 
Jian &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Wang was sentenced yesterday by U.S.
District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn, New York. 
Condoms tested from the same batch as Wang&#8217;s were found to
burst, leak and lack spermicide, prosecutors said. The brands
seized were Trojan Magnum, Trojan-ENZ, Trojan Ultra Ribbed and
Trojan Mint Tingle, according to court papers. 
Wang is also accused of trademark infringement in an
ongoing civil case brought by Church  Dwight in the same court.
Wang is one of more than 40 defendants accused of distributing
fake Trojan condoms in the area comprising the federal judicial
district known as the Eastern District of New York and in
Manhattan. 
According to court papers in the civil case, the
counterfeit condoms were sometimes packaged two to a box rather
than three, were the wrong size and the lubricated condoms were
packed with a silicon lubricant Church  Dwight doesn&#8217;t use. 
The U.K.&#8217;s Times reported in November that the making of
fake condoms was &#8220;rampant&#8221; in China and that just one workshop
in central Hunan province turned out 2.19 million condoms
produced in unsanitary settings. 
The civil case is Church  Dwight Inc. v. Kaloti
Enterprises of Michigan LLC, 1:07-cv-00612-BMC-VVP, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Mubadala Development Co. and TX Oil Limited, chaired by Neil Bush, brother of former U.S. President George W. Bush, may gain
rights to explore in Turkmenistan&#8217;s Caspian Sea blocks. 
Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov told the
government to make a choice on bids from those companies for
blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian, according to the government&#8217;s
website. 
Turkmenistan allows international investors the ability to
gain equity in offshore exploration while limiting onshore
access to its state oil and gas companies. The bulk of
Turkmenistan&#8217;s known resources, including the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest reserves of natural gas according to BP Plc data, are in
onshore fields in the country&#8217;s east. 
&#8220;Majors are more interested in bigger gas plays onshore,
but may believe that a presence offshore would help them achieve
this ultimate objective,&#8221; Ed Chow, a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic International Studies, said by e-mail
today. 
ConocoPhillips and Abu Dhabi-backed Mubadala have a venture
to explore a block in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian together.
In April, the two companies had a plan to team up in accessing
Turkmen offshore areas, a person familiar with the strategy said
at the time. 
TX Oil was formed this year to develop opportunities in
Turkmenistan. Neil Bush visited the country in February with a
letter to his father, President George H.W. Bush, to the Turkmen
president, according to the website Turkmenistan.ru. Bush again
visited the Turkmen president in June, according to the website. 
E-mails to Chevron asking for confirmation of the bid
weren&#8217;t immediately returned. TX Oil didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls. ConocoPhillips didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.

Google Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and Walt
Disney Co. are among the favorite holdings of Morris Mark,
president of Mark Asset Management Corp., Barron&#8217;s reported. 
Google, the owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search
engine, and Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker, are
underpriced because &#8220;the market is overlooking that you can buy
quality today at no premium,&#8221; the New York-based asset manager,
who oversees about $500 million, told Barron&#8217;s in its Aug. 16
edition. 
&#8220;Google&#8217;s management is constantly improving its product
and is constantly out there being willing to develop something
internally or buy something externally to really make Google a
better product,&#8221; Mark told Barron&#8217;s. Buying YouTube Inc. in
2006 will pay off a &#8220;big way&#8221; because almost every television
sold will allow access to web video starting next year, he said. 
Coca-Cola earnings growth will accelerate because it has a
global brand and a presence in emerging markets such as China,
he said. Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, should have
a higher valuation than it already does compared with rivals
Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., he said. Disney&#8217;s Marvel and
Pixar studios are strengthening and its ESPN sports channel has
&#8220;strong&#8221; audience demographics that allow it to charge more
for advertising, he said. 
Google, based in Mountain View, California, is down 22
percent this year, compared with a 2.2 percent drop for Atlanta-

Carnarvon Basin off Australia&#8217;s western coast. 
The Acme-1 well encountered about 896 feet (273 meters) of
net gas pay, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a
statement. The well was drilled to a depth of 15,469 feet in
2,880 feet of water. 
The discovery is the company&#8217;s ninth and biggest off the
coast of western Australia in the past 12 months, Vice Chairman
George Kirkland said in the statement. Chevron announced Aug. 12
that its Brederode-1 exploration well in the Carnarvon Basin
found 49 feet of net gas pay. 
The company is operator of the WA-205-P permit area, which
includes the Acme-1 well, and has a 67 percent stake in the
prospect. A unit of Europe&#8217;s Royal Dutch Shell Plc owns the
rest. 
Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson is looking to
increase oil and gas production with projects in places such as
the Gulf of Mexico and Australia. The company has said its
proposed Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied-natural-gas ventures
are centerpieces of its global growth plans. 
The latest find is expected &#8220;to help underpin&#8221; possible
expansions at the Wheatstone gas hub, Jim Blackwell, president
of Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration  Production, said in the
statement. 
Chevron rose 31 cents to $77.71 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Shell declined 0.3 percent to
1,772 pence in London. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest U.S. oil company.

Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s biggest
merger adviser this year, hired Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Felix Scherzer,
an investment banker to financial companies such as American
International Group Inc. 
Scherzer joined Morgan Stanley on Aug. 6, according to
records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, confirmed the hire
and said he is a managing director in the firm&#8217;s financial
institutions group. 
Scherzer was part of the Citigroup team that advised AIG
this year on the $15.5 billion agreement to sell the American
Life Insurance Co. unit to MetLife Inc. He also counseled the
bailed-out insurer on a $35.5 billion deal to sell another
division to Prudential Plc. That planned transaction later
collapsed amid opposition from Prudential&#8217;s shareholders, and
AIG is planning an initial public offering. 
Before joining Citigroup in 2006, Scherzer worked at Lazard
Ltd. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s investment bank has been hiring financial
specialists this year, adding Gary Shedlin, a banker whose
clients include BlackRock Inc., from Citigroup, and David Heaton
from Deutsche Bank AG. The financial institutions group is led
by Jonathan Pruzan and Eric Bischof. 
Morgan Stanley is advising on $230.6 billion of mergers
this year, the most of any firm, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Citigroup is ranked seventh.

Global crude oil demand may have
exceeded supply in the past two months as inventories stored on
tankers fell to an 18-month low, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. 
&#8220;Now that floating storage has dropped to its lowest
levels in over 18 months, we expect to experience declining
onshore inventories in coming months,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts
including David Greely and Stefan Wieler said in a report today.
&#8220;Given that world demand tends to increase seasonally in the
second half, we would expect the draw on world inventories to
accelerate.&#8221; 
Oil held on ships may have dropped by as much as 40 million
to 45 million barrels in June and July, in part due to the
clearing of a &#8220;large portion&#8221; of Iranian floating storage,
Goldman said. 
&#8220;The June-July discharge of floating storage suggests that
the draw at sea has more than offset the build on shore, which
the International Energy Agency estimates at 21 million
barrels,&#8221; Goldman analysts said. 
World oil demand exceeded supply by 600,000 barrels a day,
or 36.9 million barrels more than normal in June and July, based
on the IEA estimate of a 13.3 million barrels draw on combined
onshore OECD inventories and global floating storage, Goldman
said in the report. 
West Texas Intermediate crude time spreads, the difference
between monthly futures contracts, have strengthened, suggesting
a tighter physical oil market, Goldman said. 
Goldman said that the time spread from the first to the
60th month gained as much as $10 a barrel to trade at about
minus $8 to minus $10. 
&#8220;We continue to expect the WTI forward curve to flatten in
the second half, lifting prompt WTI prices into the $85-$95 a
barrel range,&#8221; Goldman said. 
The company reiterated its recommendation to buy December
WTI crude futures, which traded up 44 cents to $77.38 a barrel
at 11:49 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Commodities demand from emerging
markets and limited growth in supplies will help to support
prices toward the end of the year, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., which backed oil, gold, copper, zinc and platinum. 
The bank reiterated an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on
commodities, analysts led by Allison Nathan and Jeffrey Currie
wrote in a report. Goldman pared its 12-month forecast for the
SP GSCI Enhanced Total Returns Index to a 19 percent gain from
21.6 after recent gains in agricultural commodities and metals. 
Commodities last week had the worst weekly performance in
six after the Federal Reserve said the recovery is weakening and
European industrial output fell, stoking concern that there may
be a double-dip recession. Reports also showed China&#8217;s retail
sales and new lending grew in July at a slower pace than June. 
&#8220;We are not overly optimistic about commodities prices in
the second half,&#8221; Ni Xiaolei, a trader at Donghai Futures Co.,
said from Jiangsu today. &#8220;&#8216;We saw a very sharp ascent in
commodity prices last month,  which will be hard to sustain as
global macroeconomic data emerges weaker than expected.&#8217;&#8217; 
Goldman&#8217;s commodity &#8216;&#8216;overweight&#8217;&#8217; call was maintained even
as the bank has been paring forecasts for U.S. and Japanese
economic growth for next year. Ed McKelvey, Goldman&#8217;s senior U.S.
economist in New York, has also said that the chance the U.S.
may tumble back into recession is as high as 30 percent. 
Gold, Crude 
Gold, which surged to a record $1,265.30 an ounce in June
amid concern sovereign-debt levels in Europe may be excessive,
traded at $1,29.60 at 2:11 p.m. in Singapore, 11 percent higher
this year. Goldman forecast a rise to $1,260 in three months and
to $1,300 in six. New York crude futures were at $75.86 a barrel,
4.4 percent lower over 2010. Goldman&#8217;s report put them at $92 a
barrel in three months. 
&#8216;&#8216;The current softness in economic data, combined with
increasingly mixed signals from the underlying commodity markets,
is likely to continue to generate choppy commodity-price action
in the near term,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote in the Aug. 13
report. Still, &#8220;high and rising emerging-market demand levels
against limited supply growth in key commodities are likely to
increasingly tighten balances,&#8221; they wrote. 
Japan&#8217;s economy expanded at an annualized 0.4 percent in
the three months to June 30, the Cabinet Office said today.
That&#8217;s the slowest pace in three quarters. U.S. industrial
production figures are due for release tomorrow, the same day as
data on investor confidence in Germany. 
Chinese Demand 
Commodity prices may advance into the end of the year on
evidence of increased oil demand in China, a decline in crude
stockpiles in Europe and the U.S., and further falls in metals
inventories, the report said. 
&#8220;We expect upside to be greatest for crude oil, copper,
zinc, platinum and gold,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Improved data will likely
be required to sustain rising prices.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs last week backed gold to resume a rally and
climb to a record $1,300 an ounce within six months on renewed
investor interest. The precious metal, which has risen for nine
years to last year, may also climb in 2011, the report said. 
A ban on wheat exports by Russia helped to drive futures to
$8.68 a bushel earlier this month, the highest price in almost
two years. The country is battling reduced grains production
amid the worst drought in at least 50 years. 
&#8216;Sharp Gains&#8217; 
&#8220;Commodity returns rose over the past month led by sharp
gains in the agricultural complex owing to weather-related
supply shocks in wheat,&#8221; according to the Goldman report. 
Zinc, trading today at $2,080 a metric ton, has fallen 19
percent this year, making it the worst performer on the London
Metal Exchange. Goldman&#8217;s analysts forecast that the metal may
climb to $2,121 a ton in six months, according to the report. 
Copper rose 1.3 percent to $7,246.50 a metric ton, paring
this year&#8217;s loss to 1.7 percent, while platinum gained 0.8
percent to $1,535.75 an ounce, 5 percent stronger this year.
Goldman forecast copper at $7,925 a ton in six months. 
Japan will grow 1.4 percent in 2011, compared with an
earlier forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman&#8217;s Tokyo-based senior
economist Chiwoong Lee said in a report dated Aug. 7. The week
before that Goldman lowered its projection for U.S. growth for
the same year to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent.

Wall Street banks led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley stand to make a combined $120
million on General Motors Co.&#8217;s initial public offering. If it
weren&#8217;t for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., they could have made four
times as much. 
In a pitch to the U.S. Treasury in May, Goldman Sachs
offered to accept a fee of 0.75 percent, according to people
with direct knowledge of the matter. That&#8217;s a fraction of the 3
percent banks typically charge on the largest IPOs and well
below the 2 percent offered by Bank of America Corp. and other
banks that presented to Treasury, said the people, speaking
anonymously because the matter is private. 
Goldman Sachs, which had just been sued for fraud by
federal regulators and has ties to GM competitor Ford Motor Co.,
didn&#8217;t get a top role in the IPO. The government imposed the fee
pitched by Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn and his five-person
team on all underwriters, angering the banks, the people said. 
&#8220;The fact the other banks are furious at Goldman is not
surprising,&#8221; said Samuel Hayes, a professor emeritus of
investment banking at Harvard Business School in Boston. &#8220;They
feel it gave the government a real lever to force down fees on
the underwriters. But the deal still has a lot of marquee
value.&#8221; 
Subsidized Car Purchases 
Banks involved in the deal include lead managers JPMorgan
and Morgan Stanley, as well as Bank of America and Citigroup
Inc., among others. Some banks made different concessions in
their pitches to the Treasury. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America and Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG offered
to use some of their fees to buy GM vehicles or to subsidize
employee purchases of GM cars and trucks, according to the
people with knowledge of the matter. 
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Rachman and spokespeople
for the other banks declined to comment. Treasury spokesman Mark Paustenbach also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs will have a role in the offering, as will
Credit Suisse, said the people. Five U.S. banks pitched GM and
the Treasury on May 19 in Washington, and non-U.S. lenders made
presentations in early June. All sent top executives, such as
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and John Mack,
chairman of Morgan Stanley. 
Treasury officials including Ronald Bloom, chief of the
auto task force, and GM executives were concerned that if it
became public the government hadn&#8217;t picked Goldman Sachs&#8217;s low
bid, they would face criticism for wasting taxpayer money
because of a bias against the firm, the people said. The
officials and executives decided, in conjunction with Lazard
Ltd., which is advising Treasury, to use the Goldman Sachs bid
and impose it on other banks. 
&#8216;Probably Serious&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs signaled that it was willing to make a bid
for pretty much any amount, according to two people who saw the
bank&#8217;s presentation. Rivals grumbled that Goldman Sachs knew it
couldn&#8217;t win the lead on the GM offering, so it submitted a low
bid knowing that would force Treasury to squeeze whichever banks
did win the job, these people said. 
&#8220;The investment banks have always been cutthroat in their
competition,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they did it just to
squeeze their competitors. They were probably serious.&#8221; 
All the U.S. banks, apart from Bank of America and Bermuda-
based Lazard, have their headquarters in New York. 
4-Cent Fee 
In India, Goldman Sachs this year tied for the lowest bid
among 17 banks vying to manage a $1.8 billion offer by state-
owned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., three people with
knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs and SBI Capital
Markets Ltd. said they&#8217;d do the work for a fee equal to
0.00000001 percent of the sale proceeds -- equivalent to about 2
rupees (4 cents) each on the deal. 
At the time of the pitch, Goldman Sachs and the Securities
and Exchange Commission were at odds over allegations Goldman
Sachs had sold mortgage-related securities designed to fail. The
firm settled the suit last month for $550 million and
acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake.&#8221; A June poll showed that the
firm suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to a global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. 
GM, 61 percent owned by the government after a $50 billion
taxpayer bailout, aims to raise $12 billion to $16 billion in
the IPO and plans to file the registration statement as early as
today, according to people familiar with the situation. At that
size, the IPO would be the second-largest in the U.S. after San
Francisco-based Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion offering in March
2008. 
Goldman Trails 
While the IPO is paying a quarter of the usual rate for the
largest initial offerings in the U.S., fees would equal about 16
percent of the total $728.4 million of revenue generated from
all U.S. IPOs this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
Goldman Sachs, which won the biggest share of fees from
underwriting U.S. IPOs in 2009, has slipped to third this year
behind Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, the data show. The firm&#8217;s
first-half revenue from underwriting equity sales also trailed
JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to company reports. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, has been credited with 12.6 percent of the $11.3
billion in initial sales this year. Last year, it had 21.3
percent, according to Bloomberg data. 
Still, American companies that used Goldman Sachs as the
lead underwriter got the highest prices for their shares in the
first half, selling at an average 1.4 percent discount to their
offering range, the data show. Companies that didn&#8217;t hire the
141-year-old firm to lead their IPOs took an average discount of
14 percent for their shares. 
Ford Backs Goldman 
Goldman Sachs bankers have advised Ford since 1953 and the
firm managed Ford&#8217;s IPO in January 1956, the biggest ever at the
time. Sidney Weinberg, the Goldman Sachs chairman who managed
the sale and was later named to Ford&#8217;s board, used Ford &#8220;to
leapfrog his firm&#8217;s standing on Wall Street into the top tier of
underwriters,&#8221; according to Charles Ellis&#8217;s book &#8220;The
Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
Ford publicly backed Goldman Sachs after the firm was sued
for fraud by the SEC. &#8220;We have a long relationship with Goldman
Sachs and expect it to continue,&#8221; Ford spokesman Mark Truby
said on April 20, four days after the SEC sued Goldman Sachs.

Robert Moffat, the former

guilty in the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading scheme, said
accused tipster Danielle Chiesi &#8220;played him&#8221; to obtain tips. 
Moffat, 54, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and
conspiracy in March, made the claim in court papers seeking
leniency when he&#8217;s sentenced Sept. 13. Moffat claimed he had an
&#8220;intimate relationship&#8221; with Chiesi, 44, a former executive at
New York-based New Castle Funds LLC who was arrested along with
Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. 
&#8220;Ms. Chiesi was not the passive recipient of information

&#8220;To the contrary, she manipulated or &#8216;played&#8217; him to obtain

Moffat, who started at IBM as a junior programmer in 1978,
admitted that he leaked Chiesi information about IBM, Lenovo
Group Ltd. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He said he wasn&#8217;t
asked to cooperate with prosecutors in the case and hasn&#8217;t done
so. 
Prosecutors yesterday asked U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts to sentence Moffat to six months in prison. Moffat is
seeking probation. 
Danielle Chiesi 
Moffat met Chiesi in 2002 and the two became professional
friends, according to the papers filed by Moffat today. Chiesi
often told Moffat her ideas about how IBM could best present
itself to investors.

A Pfizer Inc. unit is seeking to
duck responsibility for two women&#8217;s breast cancers linked to its
Prempro menopause drug, a lawyer argued at the end of a trial. 
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth subsidiary rejected Sharon Buxton&#8217;s and Joy
Henry&#8217;s claims that its hormone-replacement medicine helped
cause their cancers in the face of a wealth of evidence to the
contrary, Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for the women, told a state
court jury today in Philadelphia. 
&#8220;Wyeth accepts responsibility for not a single breast
cancer,&#8221; Littlepage said in closing arguments in the trial of
the two women&#8217;s lawsuit against the drugmaker. The pair seek at
least $100,000 total in damages in the first phase of the case. 
More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of
Health-sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased cancer
risk. 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. 
Wyeth&#8217;s witnesses testified during the five-week trial that
researchers haven&#8217;t conclusively found Prempro causes breast
cancer, and Buxton&#8217;s and Henry&#8217;s lawyers didn&#8217;t produce enough
evidence linking their cancers to the drug to win, Beth Wilkinson, one of the company&#8217;s attorneys, told jurors. 
&#8216;Lot of Proof&#8217; 
&#8220;We brought you a whole lot of proof&#8221; that Prempro wasn&#8217;t
the culprit in the cancers, Wilkinson argued. 
Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out at the post-trial stage and or had
awards reduced. 
Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases were set for
trials, according to court filings. 
A judge in Philadelphia refused in May to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. 
Buxton, 66, took Prempro over six years before the retired
scheduler for a surgical practice developed breast cancer, court
filings show. Henry, a 76-year-old owner of a moving company,
took the drug for eight years before being diagnosed with the
disease. 
Clash Over Cause 
Littlepage contends Wyeth knew the hormone-based Prempro
could promote the growth of cancer and should be held liable.
Wyeth officials counter that researchers can&#8217;t pinpoint a single
cause of breast cancer and the medicine can&#8217;t be held
responsible for the disease. 
If jurors find for the women, they can award money for
medical expenses, lost wages and pain and suffering. The panel
then will be asked to decide whether Wyeth failed to adequately
warn patients and doctors about Prempro&#8217;s risks.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s menopause drug Prempro
didn&#8217;t cause two women&#8217;s cancers, and the drugmaker doesn&#8217;t have
to pay damages over those illnesses, a jury decided. 
Jurors in state court in Philadelphia deliberated about
four hours before concluding today that Prempro wasn&#8217;t a
&#8220;factual cause&#8221; of Sharon Buxton&#8217;s and Joy Henry&#8217;s breast
cancers. The women sought at least $100,000 in damages. 
&#8220;While we have great sympathy for Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Henry
and their families, we believe the verdicts in this case confirm
our position,&#8221; Pfizer said in a statement. &#8220;The vast majority
of women who take hormone therapy do not get breast cancer.&#8221; 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn Co.&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in Prempro. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed the $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in 2003
as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. 
More than 6 million women took hormone drugs to treat
menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before
the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-
sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased cancer risk. 
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer,
said in an interview that the study also showed that &#8220;99.6
percent of users&#8221; didn&#8217;t get breast cancer. 
Jury Trials 
Wyeth has lost seven of the 12 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out at the post-trial stage or had awards
reduced. 
A judge in Philadelphia refused in May to throw out a $9.4
million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her breast
cancer. The case is on appeal. 
Buxton, 66, took Prempro for six years before the retired
scheduler for a surgical practice developed breast cancer, court
filings show. Henry, a 76-year-old owner of a moving company,
took the drug for eight years before being diagnosed with the
disease. 
Beth Wilkinson, an attorney for Pfizer, said in a phone
interview that the trial with two plaintiffs was &#8220;incredibly
challenging.&#8221; Her team was helped by being &#8220;allowed to focus
on the science first&#8221; and show jurors that &#8220;there&#8217;s no
evidence that Prempro causes breast cancer&#8221; based on testimony
from practicing cancer doctors, she said. 
Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for Buxton and Henry, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call or an e-mail seeking comment on
the verdict. 
Pfizer, which reported $50 billion in sales last year, fell
17 cents to $16.10 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at 4 p.m. The shares have dropped 11 percent this year. 
The case is Buxton v. Wyeth, 00202, Court of Common Pleas
(Philadelphia).

Much ink is being spilled over the
meaning of China&#8217;s economy surpassing Japan&#8217;s. 
Even more important is what it doesn&#8217;t mean: greater
Chinese purchasing power, longer life spans, better health care
and education, freedom of speech, assembly, religion and
expression, safer roads, building standards, free elections,
clean air and water or social harmony. 
It&#8217;s great that China is growing 10 percent. Just don&#8217;t get
carried away about what this moment means. China faces the
daunting task of getting per-capita income into the orbit of
Japan&#8217;s, which is 10 times higher. That&#8217;s what matters and we
are a decade away from knowing how China will do. 
China is altering the global economy, and not always for
the better. Two phenomena growing before our eyes are the spread
of an authoritarian model and the dominance of the &#8220;Wal-Mart
economy,&#8221; both of which represent a race to the bottom. 
No, I&#8217;m not betting against China. Only the most cynical
and short-sighted among us would want China to fail. A fifth of
humanity enmeshed in crisis is in no one&#8217;s best interest. 
China, though, must beat history. No economic giant has
avoided a major crisis. If China is to eclipse the U.S. by 2027,
as London-based economist Jim O&#8217;Neill of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicts, it must grow at today&#8217;s rates indefinitely.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the world&#8217;s largest professional-
services organization, says it will happen in 2020. 
At the moment, China&#8217;s trajectory is anathema to what Adam Smith taught us about the nature of economic development. 
Authoritarian Example 
&#8220;China legitimizes a market-authoritarian example,&#8221; says
Stefan Halper, a senior fellow at Magdalene College in
Cambridge, England, and the author of &#8220;The Beijing Consensus.&#8221; 
With American-style capitalism in tatters and Europe
unraveling, developing nations are clamoring for new role
models. Countries from Angola to Myanmar to Venezuela see
China&#8217;s state-directed capitalism combined with authoritarian
rule as a better path than liberalization and democracy. 
How you create thriving markets over time without
transparency and a free press is beyond me. Wall Street took
things too far and acted shamefully thanks to too little
oversight. China has the opposite problem. 
There&#8217;s a reason investors question China&#8217;s data. The
country somehow comes up with a single figure in a structurally
imbalanced system of 1 billion-plus people at very different
levels of development, a healthy gray economy and local
governments whose budgets rely on reporting rapid growth. 
One Number 
With modest resources, officials settle on one number
purporting to capture the daily activities of the nation --
almost always within the range of expectations of economists
from Shanghai to New York. Try explaining that. 
The spread of the &#8220;Wal-Mart economy,&#8221; an ever-growing
effort to mass-produce at the cheapest cost, also bears
watching. China&#8217;s reluctance to let the yuan strengthen
underlines the primacy of its exports. As China grows, so does
the scope and efficiency of this trade machine. That would be
fine if output were translating into rapid increases in domestic
consumption. It&#8217;s not. 
There have been rays of hope on that front, such as demands
for higher wages among factory workers. There are limits,
though, to how much the government will allow income to
skyrocket, lest it fuels inflation or reduces competitiveness.
Chinese, like Germans, will continue to produce more than they
consume. Companies are reinvesting much of what they earn in
increasing capacity, upgrading the machine. 
Deceiving Trends 
News reports that China is now the biggest market for cars
and cell phones and that LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA is
making a beeline there are deceiving. They suggest vast pockets
of consumers can afford such goods. They can&#8217;t. China&#8217;s
purchasing power is growing slower than its ability to undercut
all competitors in the production of goods and services. 
As China becomes better at churning things out cheaply,
other developing nations will be at a loss. Until recently,
Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines were
ecstatic about China&#8217;s growth. Now they see it&#8217;s more of a zero-
sum game than they anticipated. Expect this dynamic to grow with
China&#8217;s size. This is a budding, but major, geopolitical issue. 
China may have regrets about passing Japan. More will now
be asked of its leaders on climate change, North Korea, energy
deals that support dodgy regimes, and even human rights. 
Size matters less than the quality of growth. China, for
example, surpassed Japan in trademark patent filings in 2009.
Further progress here means China may well be home to the next
Silicon Valley. That is, if the nation&#8217;s state-economy model
doesn&#8217;t smother innovation. 
The entrepreneurial potential is a key reason investors are
bullish on China. Japanese are doing lots of soul-searching this
week, wondering why they became No. 3. Here&#8217;s why: In China, you
have 1.3 billion people working hard to circumvent government
regulations so they can make a quick yuan. Japan has 126 million
complaining about how the government isn&#8217;t fixing their lives. 
Whatever happens, China has some work to do before it can
topple the U.S. from the top slot.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to sell
$1 billion of commercial mortgage-backed bonds, giving control
of soured loans to a holder of the riskiest portion after
another offering ceded power to investors in the safest pieces. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s sale, the largest this year of the debt, would
grant hedge fund H/2 Capital Partners LLC, the buyer of the
bottom $50 million slice, primary authority over troubled loans,
according to people familiar with the transaction who declined
to be identified because negotiations are private. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. gave those rights to investors of
the highest-rated portions in a $788.5 million offering on Aug.
4. 
Concern that holders of the riskiest pieces may make
decisions favoring their own interests prompted Goldman Sachs to
switch from the traditional structure of securities backed by
hotels, shopping malls and skyscrapers. Spreading control among
numerous senior bondholders may create confusion in the event of
defaults, according to NewOak Capital LLC&#8217;s Ron D&#8217;Vari. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to come to terms with delinquent
borrowers as it is,&#8221; said D&#8217;Vari, chief executive officer of
the advisory and asset-management firm in New York, and
previously the head of structured finance at BlackRock Inc. &#8220;If
you multilayer that with additional bureaucracy, it becomes more
difficult.&#8221; 
Sales Decline 
H/2, the Stamford, Connecticut-based commercial-real estate
fixed-income manger, will receive a yield of more than 14
percent on its 10-year investment, assuming the loans take no
losses, one of the people said. 
That compares with an 8.55 percent average yield for
speculative-grade companies, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. High-yield, high-
risk, or junk, debt is ranked below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
The higher-ranked portions of the deal are set to be
offered next month, the people said. 
Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, Michael DuVally of
Goldman Sachs and Alex Samuelson at Citigroup, all in New York,
declined to comment. 
Spencer Haber, chief executive officer of H/2 Capital,
didn&#8217;t respond to a phone call seeking comment. 
Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities plunged 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks arranged
$3.4 billion of the securities last year, and about $2.4 billion
has been issued in 2010. 
B-Pieces 
Top-ranked securities yield 2.76 percentage points more
than Treasuries, compared with 3.95 percentage points at the
start of the year, and 4.84 percentage points a year ago,
according to a Barclays Plc index. 
Late payments on commercial mortgages bundled and sold as
bonds are at a record 8.25 percent as of July, compared with
3.04 percent a year earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. 
Investors who hold the most-junior slices, or B-pieces, are
first to be wiped out as losses mount and may have an incentive
to keep the debt outstanding rather than foreclose, potentially
punishing other holders.

Blackstone Group LP, the world&#8217;s
largest buyout firm, agreed to invest $500 million in General
Growth Properties Inc. as part of its restructuring plan as the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a formal insider-
trading probe of some of the mall owner&#8217;s officials. 
Blackstone reached the deal with the investor group
financing the plan, General Growth said in a revised
reorganization proposal filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York. General Growth received notice in July that the SEC
is investigating possible insider-trading violations by current
and former officers and directors. 
General Growth, the second-largest mall owner in the U.S.,
is scheduled to seek court permission this week to send the
reorganization plan to creditors for a vote. Blackstone, based
in New York, would get new common stock and shares in a new
company that General Growth will spin off when it exits
bankruptcy, according to court papers. 
General Growth, based in Chicago, described Blackstone&#8217;s
participation as a &#8220;potential&#8221; investment in an earlier
version of the plan. In the new version, General Growth also
agreed to issue new notes to replace certain so-called Rouse
notes. The company previously planned to reinstate $1.35 billion
worth of the debt. 
David Keating, a General Growth spokesman, couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment on the terms of the new notes.

New Filings 
Apex Digital Files for Reorganization in Los Angeles 
Apex Digital Inc., one of America&#8217;s leading providers of
Apex Digital-branded televisions, sought bankruptcy protection
from creditors to modify its business model. 
The closely held Walnut, California-based company listed as
much as $50 million in both assets and debt in Chapter 11
documents filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los
Angeles. 
&#8220;This restructuring plan allows Apex to grow its business
in a new direction capitalizing on the increasing demand for
green energy. This is an area where we have a proven track
record and a number of new products under development,&#8221; David
Ji, Apex Digital&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, said in statement
yesterday. 
The company said in the statement it will seek approval of
a restructuring plan that will allow it to modify its business
strategy to expand its consulting business and grow its green
energy lighting products line. The company said it has adequate
working capital to continue business operations normally. 
Apex Digital, founded in 1997, provides and markets
consumer electronics, including high-definition LCD televisions,
home entertainment media devices, solar powered lights and
digital set top boxes. The trademark &#8220;Apex Digital&#8221; is owned

Updates 
Visteon Ordered to Reinstate Health Care to Retirees 
A judge ordered Visteon Corp. to reinstate health benefits
to thousands of retirees who lost insurance coverage after the
auto-parts maker filed for bankruptcy. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher S. Sontchi said yesterday
he will give the company a chance to help him decide how quickly
the benefits will be restored to more than 6,000 retirees. The
former workers, many of whom held jobs at now-closed Midwest
factories, must also be reimbursed for any health-care expenses
they incurred since the cuts took place in May, Sontchi said. 
Sontchi&#8217;s decision follows a July 15 appeals court order
that the benefits for 2,100 former workers in Indiana be
restored. Sontchi had ruled in December that the company had the
right to cancel the coverage without first negotiating with the
union. The Indiana workers are covered by yesterday&#8217;s ruling. 
Visteon, based in Van Buren Township, Michigan, filed for
bankruptcy last year, citing the faltering economy and a
slowdown in car sales. The company, which makes parts for
vehicle interiors, is a former division of Ford Motor Co.

Tribune Creditors Get More Time to Vote on Plan 
A judge gave Tribune Co. creditors more time to vote on the
publishing company&#8217;s plan to exit bankruptcy while it negotiates
with opponents. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey yesterday in
Wilmington, Delaware, scheduled a hearing for Aug. 20 to set
court dates that may affect the company&#8217;s plan to exit
bankruptcy this year. 
James Conlan, a Tribune attorney, said company officials
are talking with creditors who oppose its plan to give more than
90 percent of Tribune to the lenders who financed a 2007 buyout.
Lower-ranking creditors who hold $1.2 billion in pre-buyout debt
would get nothing under the plan. 
Creditors have been reviewing a report by a court-appointed
examiner who found evidence of a fraudulent transfer involving
part of the deal that real-estate billionaire Sam Zell used to
take over Tribune. Creditors are &#8220;somewhat likely&#8221; to win a
lawsuit based on the smaller piece of the $8.3 billion
transaction, the examiner said. 
Some creditors have said the report will help them decide
how to vote on Tribune&#8217;s reorganization plan. Carey will take
those votes into consideration when he decides whether to
approve the plan at a hearing scheduled to start in October. 
Depending on how negotiations go this week, that date,
along with other related deadlines, may change, Conlan said. 
Tribune owns the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and
television and radio stations. It filed for bankruptcy in
December 2008, about a year after the buyout was completed. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Harrisburg Hires Scott Balice to Help With Debt-Recovery Plan 
Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, hired Scott
Balice Strategies to help plan a financial recovery after
missing payments on $282 million of debt for an incinerator and
considering bankruptcy. 
Mayor Linda Thompson, who took office in January, announced
the appointment yesterday at a City Hall press conference. 
Harrisburg faces $68 million in payments this year on debt
tied to the incinerator, which is managed by the Harrisburg
Authority. The cost is about four times what the city of 47,000
raises through property taxes annually, according to its budget.
Harrisburg and the authority have so far skipped $6 million in
loan and bond payments, and have missed two $637,500 loan
payments to Covanta Holding Corp., the incinerator operator. 
&#8220;The Scott Balice Strategies team has the experience and
expertise to advise the city at this critical juncture,&#8221;
Thompson said in a press release. &#8220;With their assistance the
city will identify and implement the most efficient strategies
to maximize value for all of the city&#8217;s stakeholders.&#8221; 
Thompson is struggling to win City Council support for a
plan to lease parking garages and meters to a private operator
to raise money for debt-service payments. 
Scott Balice, based in Chicago, is working on a parking
facility lease plan for Pittsburgh. Lois Scott, president of

The Newark Group Emerges from Chapter 11, Closes on Exit Loans 
Newark Group Inc., a manufacturer of recycled paperboard
and paperboard products, announced yesterday that it had emerged
from bankruptcy protection and closed on its exit loans. 
The Cranford, New Jersey-based company won court approval
of its reorganization plan July 30, 51 days after seeking
bankruptcy protection. The paperboard maker listed from $100
million to $500 million in both debts and assets in Chapter 11
documents when it filed June 9. 
&#8220;We are pleased to have the continued support of our
lenders and stakeholders as we have completed the steps
necessary to strengthen our balance sheet so we are poised for
sustainable growth,&#8221; Robert Mullen, Chief Executive Officer of
The Newark Group, said in an Aug. 16 statement. &#8220;We emerge from
Chapter 11 a well capitalized private company with a much
improved operating profile.&#8221; 
Under the company&#8217;s restructuring plan, about $175 million
in unsecured subordinated notes were converted into 96.5 percent
of the reorganized company&#8217;s equity. Trade suppliers and
unsecured creditors owed about $57 million were paid in full.
Shareholders, with 84 percent of the company&#8217;s equity, got 1.5
percent of new common stock plus warrants to buy up to 15
percent. The plan also gave owners of employee stock options up
to 2 percent of new stock. 
The Newark Group closed on a $70 million revolving loan
from Wells Fargo Capital Finance and a $110 million term loan
from Orix Finance, as the last step of its restructuring. The
exit loans will provide the company with about $25 million in
undrawn liquidity, according to the statement. 
The case is In Re The Newark Group Inc., 10-27694, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). 
Lawsuits 
Madoff Feeder Fund, Fairfield Sentry, Sues Investors 
Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund that transferred $3.2
billion to convicted swindler Bernard Madoff, sued 17 of its
shareholders to try to recover money they received. 
Fairfield Sentry, an affiliate of Fairfield Greenwich
Group, said it had no way to repay the $3.2 billion without
getting back the money its shareholders received since about
2004, according to the complaints it filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. Fairfield Sentry said it raised money for
Madoff without knowing he was running a Ponzi scheme. 
Fairfield Sentry is trying to recover more than $160
million in payments it made to shareholders, including Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner 
Smith Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Sub A/C. 
The biggest claims are being made against Banque Privee
Edmond de Rothschild SA for $33.7 million, Meritz Fire  Marine
Insurance Co. for $21.9 million and Bank Hapoalim (Suisse) Ltd.
for $20 million. 
Fairfield Sentry is being liquidated under the supervision
of the Commercial Division of the High Court of Justice in the
British Virgin Islands. 
The first case filed is Fairfield Sentry Ltd. v. Theodoor
GGC Amsterdam, 10-03496, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). 
Briefly Noted 
Nikolaus Bets on Default Surge in Expansion to Distressed Debt 
Nikolaus  Co. LLP, a restructuring specialist established
in Germany in 2001, is raising as much as $50 million to invest
in distressed debt, betting a slowing recovery will lead to
&#8220;unprecedented&#8221; defaults. 
&#8220;The recent financial environment has created the perfect
hunting ground,&#8221; said Chief Investment Officer Stefan Benedetti. There will be &#8220;a default and restructuring cycle on
an unprecedented scale,&#8221; he said. 
Nikolaus&#8217;s Alloro Global Special Situations Fund will be
based in London and marks the firm&#8217;s first expansion into hedge-
fund management. The fund will focus on Europe, the former
Soviet Union and Latin America and will target debt sold by
telecoms, manufacturing and financial companies. 
&#8220;I look at the world in terms of whether a company can pay
its debt,&#8221; Benedetti said. &#8220;And if it goes bankrupt I want to
know what I can recover from the situation.&#8221; 
Regency Lenders Said to Consult Lazard on $700 Million of Loans 
Regency Entertainment SA&#8217;s lenders are consulting financial
advisory firm Lazard Ltd. as the Greek casino operator seeks to
restructure about 600 million euros ($714 million) of loans. 
Regency, which is owned by London-based BC Partners Ltd.,
is starting discussions with lenders to reorganize its debt,
according to three people familiar with the matter. The Athens-
based company is being advised by Houlihan Lokey Howard  Zukin,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. 
Andrew Honnor, a London-based spokesman for BC Partners,
declined to comment. Andrea Hewitt, a spokeswoman for Houlihan
Lokey in London, also wouldn&#8217;t comment. Spokesmen for Regency
and Lazard couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. 
BC Partners acquired Regency in 2006 using a 680 million-
euro ($876 million) leveraged-buyout loan arranged by Deutsche
Bank AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Mexicana Pilots Agree to Investors Terms, Horcasitas Says 
Grupo Mexicana de Aviacion&#8217;s pilots&#8217; union has reached an
agreement with new investors to rescue the company, said
Communications and Transportation Minister Juan Molinar Horcasitas. 
The investors would acquire all of the company&#8217;s
operations, including the low-cost Click and Link airlines,
Horcasitas said in an interview with Radio Formula. The union is
working to present a restructuring plan to Mexicana&#8217;s creditors,
he said. 
Blockbuster&#8217;s $300 Million Notes Drop to Record Low 4.75 Cents 
Bonds of Blockbuster Inc. fell to a record low as the
Dallas-based video-rental chain seeks to restructure its debt. 
The 9 percent notes due in 2012 fell 3.25 cents to 4.75
cents on the dollar yesterday as of 11:11 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The company&#8217;s notes
have declined from 73.5 cents on the dollar in September, Trace
data show. 
Defaults 
U.S. Bank TruPS CDO Defaults Pass 14% on July Spike, Fitch Says 
Eleven new bank defaults on U.S. bank trust preferred
security collateralized debt obligations pushed the Fitch
Ratings default and deferral index past the 14 percent mark as
of July, according to the latest results. 
New defaults totaled $129.5 million last month, affecting
16 CDOs, Fitch said in a statement yesterday. Twenty two banks
also began deferring interest payments on about $302.5 million
of collateral in 23 trust preferred security CDOs. 
The 11 new bank defaults bring the total to 134, affecting
82 CDOs. The 357 banks now deferring are affecting interest
payments on $6.5 billion of collateral held by 83 trust
preferred security CDOs. 
Fitch&#8217;s Bank Default and Deferral Index tracks defaults and
deferrals by banks and bank holding companies of 85 bank trust
preferred security CDOs encompassing approximately $37.7 billion
of bank collateral originated. The index includes all types of
securities issued by banks and bank holding companies such as
trust preferred security and senior and subordinated debt. 
European Insurers Pass Sovereign-Debt Default Test, Fitch Says 
European insurers such as Allianz SE and Axa SA could
withstand a Greek sovereign-debt default without suffering
downgrades, Fitch Ratings said. 
&#8220;Stress-testing of European insurers based on their euro-
zone sovereign exposures has resulted in no rating actions,&#8221;
the firm said in a statement today. Fitch carried out the test
&#8220;based on the hypothetical scenario of a default on Greek
government debt.&#8221; 
A Europe-wide stress test conducted among banks last month
showed that seven of 91 European lenders examined needed to
raise capital. Fitch&#8217;s scenario for insurers included &#8220;knock-on
effects on the sovereign debt of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and
Italy,&#8221; the ratings firm said. 
Fitch tested the insurers in its rated portfolio, which
includes the majority of the European insurance market and most
major European insurance groups.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$484.6 million of bonds backed by a loan to Centro Properties
Group, the Australian shopping center owner seeking to refinance
$2.7 billion of debt from its U.S. business. 
The loan is secured by 72 retail properties owned by the
Glen Waverley, Australia-based company, according to people
familiar with offering who declined to be identified because
terms are private. Shopping centers in Texas account for 39
percent of the pool, while properties in New York and New Jersey
represent 21 percent. 
The transaction is the sixth sale of commercial mortgage-
backed securities this year as Wall Street seeks to revive sales
after issuance plummeted 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008
from a record $234 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The most recent offering, also tied to a single
loan, was a $660 million deal for Vornado Realty Trust earlier
this month. 
Of commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2010, three have been
linked to the properties of a single borrower. Offerings grew to
be as large as $7.6 billion and bundled as many as 300 loans
from borrowers across the U.S. as sales peaked in 2007,
Bloomberg data show. 
Wall Street banks have been writing new loans to pool for
so-called multi-borrower offerings, though many property owners
are unable to pay off the existing mortgage amid tighter
underwriting standards and prices down 41 percent from 2007
peaks, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. 
The Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index dropped 4
percent in June, the company said today in a report. The decline
was the biggest since July 2009. 
JPMorgan is preparing a $1 billion deal for September,
people familiar with that sale said. The offering, the largest
this year, will be made up of about 38 loans to different
property owners.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., won court approval to
move forward with its plan to exit bankruptcy as creditors
protest the proposal. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York today
approved a summary of the plan, known as a disclosure statement.
Under the plan, General Growth would pay creditors in full and
provide a recovery to shareholders, which is unusual in a
bankruptcy case. 
&#8220;This is a case in which we are decidedly not rearranging
the deck chairs on the Titanic,&#8221; Gropper said. &#8220;We are trying
to determine the rights of creditors who are being paid in full
and equity holders who are getting a very substantial return by
all accounts.&#8221; 
General Growth resolved most objections to the disclosure
statement before today&#8217;s hearing. Unsecured creditors still have
&#8220;significant&#8221; problems with the plan, said Michael Stamer, an
attorney for the group. Investors including Fairholme Funds Inc.
will be able to receive cash for General Growth bonds to offset
their investments, an option not available to other bondholders. 
&#8220;The investors are getting something that the other
creditors are not,&#8221; Stamer said. 
Heirs of Howard Hughes also have objected, saying they
won&#8217;t get the same recovery as creditors or shareholders.
Creditors can raise their objections when General Growth asks
Gropper to confirm the plan at an Oct. 21 hearing, he said. 
&#8216;Real Issue&#8217; 
&#8220;We&#8217;ll hear the issue, if it&#8217;s a real issue, at
confirmation,&#8221; Gropper said of the bondholders&#8217; complaint. &#8220;We
can consider why this is really discrimination.&#8221; 
General Growth, based in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy last
year after failing to refinance its debt load. The company plans
to emerge from bankruptcy this year with $8.4 billion in
financing. 
The company expects to raise $4.4 billion through the sale
of new stock to Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Fairholme and
Pershing Square Capital Management LP, and $2.15 billion from
selling notes exchangeable for stock, according to court
documents. It also plans to reinstate $1.35 billion in bonds or
issue new ones, and to spin off a group of assets into a new
company. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Mobile telephones sold in the U.S.
would need to receive FM radio signals under a proposal pushed
by broadcasters as part of a tentative agreement to end a
dispute over music royalties. 
Requiring phones to become radio receivers would be part of
a deal to pay artists for airplay between the National
Association of Broadcasters, representing radio companies led by
CBS Corp. and Entercom Communications Corp., and the MusicFirst
Coalition of artists and record labels. A trade group for makers
of mobile phones opposes the plan. 
The possible requirement is a &#8220;back room scheme&#8221; and
&#8220;the height of absurdity,&#8221; Gary Shapiro, chief executive
officer of the Consumer Electronics Association, said in an e-
mail. The group in Arlington, Virginia, lists among members
Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Motorola Inc. 
&#8220;Forced inclusion of an additional antenna, processor and
radio receiver will compromise features that consumers truly
desire, such as long battery life and light weight,&#8221; Shapiro
said. Broadcasters and the music industry are &#8220;like buggy-whip
industries that refuse to innovate and seek to impose penalties
on those that do,&#8221; he said. 
Music labels that sell compact disks and radio stations
that play recordings are struggling as consumers use the
Internet and devices such as the iPod from Cupertino,
California-based Apple.

Ian Henderson, manager of $7 billion
in resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co., said China may bid
for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., after a $40 billion BHP
Billiton Ltd. offer, while a Brazilian proposal is less likely. 
China is &#8220;dependent upon potash exports so they are a big
customer of Potash Corp.,&#8221; Henderson, who manages mining stocks
including BHP and Brazil&#8217;s Vale SA, said today on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8216;The Pulse with Andrea Catherwood.&#8217; &#8220;Brazil does
have its own potash reserves and these can be developed and I
think Vale is increasing their own production plans already.&#8221; 
Potash Corp., the world&#8217;s largest fertilizer maker, this
week rejected a $130-a-share offer from BHP, describing the bid
as &#8220;grossly inadequate.&#8221; Rival bidders may include Vale, Rio
Tinto Group and groups in Russia and China, the world&#8217;s biggest
user of fertilizer with about 30 percent of global consumption,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts. 
In the absence of a higher BHP bid, Potash Corp. sees the
best alternative offers coming from businesses backed by China
or India, or companies such as Vale, said two people familiar
with the matter. The likeliest from China are Sinochem Group,
the nation&#8217;s largest chemical trader, China Investment Corp.,
the sovereign wealth fund, or Sinofert Holdings Ltd., they said. 
&#8220;China has been acquiring production across a number of
commodity classes,&#8221; Macquarie analysts led by Duncan McKeen
wrote on Aug. 17. &#8220;Given that it is still a large net importer
of potash, it may be a logical buyer of potash production.&#8221; 
A concern for Potash Corp. would be that Chinese companies
move too slowly for the Canadian takeover code, which may force
a potential acquirer to act within a few months, they wrote in a
research report. UBS AG said in an Aug. 17 note that it doesn&#8217;t
expect Vale to lodge a competing offer. 
Hostile Bet 
BHP, the world&#8217;s biggest mining company, has arranged $45
billion of loans for its hostile bid, the most debt to finance a
takeover since February 2008. Melbourne-based BHP is seeking to
take control of Potash Corp. to become the leading producer of
fertilizer, betting on rising demand as global food needs grow. 
&#8220;What we&#8217;ve got on the table is a full offer and that&#8217;s
the only thing that I can talk about,&#8221; BHP Chief Executive
Officer Marius Kloppers said on a conference call with analysts
yesterday. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speculate about anything else.&#8221; 
Demand for potash, mined from deposits left by evaporated
seas, will rebound to 50 million metric tons this year from less
than 30 million tons in 2009, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based
Potash Corp.&#8217;s CEO Bill Doyle said on a conference call Aug. 17.
Potash is a form of potassium mined in countries including
Canada, Brazil, Germany and the U.S. and used by farmers to help
boost crop yields. 
The potash market is bottoming after prices slumped more
than 50 percent amid the global economic crisis. Saskatchewan
prices rallied to $374 a ton in the second quarter, according to
Salman Partners, from $359 a ton in the prior three months.
Potash Corp. has about 20 percent of global output capacity. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s like the Ritz, there is only one Ritz hotel around
and there is no doubt about it that this is a fantastic asset,&#8221;
Henderson said. &#8220;Clearly 2010 has been a huge recovery year for
the potash market.&#8221;

General Motors Co. filed for an
initial share offering that will mark the return of what was
once the world&#8217;s largest automaker to public markets a year
after it was bailed out by the government. 
GM, 61 percent-owned by the U.S., didn&#8217;t disclose the
number of shares that will be sold in the initial public
offering or the price range in a statement filed yesterday with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The automaker won&#8217;t
sell any common shares itself while offering preferred shares
alongside the IPO, the filing showed. 
The U.S. Treasury will sell some of the common shares it
owns in GM, according to the filing. The aim is to sell a fifth
of the Treasury&#8217;s 304 million shares, people familiar with the
IPO said in June, cutting the government&#8217;s stake to less than 50
percent. GM may hold the IPO in November, people familiar with
the matter have said. 
General Motors Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on June 1, 2009, after posting $88 billion of losses
since 2004, the last year the company reported an annual profit.
General Motors Co. emerged 39 days later. 
GM may seek to raise as much as $16 billion in the IPO, a
person familiar with the plans said last week, making it the
second-largest in U.S. history behind Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion
deal in March 2008. Outgoing Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre
has pushed to end government ownership of the Detroit-based
company, which received a $50 billion taxpayer bailout following
its bankruptcy in June 2009.

Innkeepers Creditors Want Apollo&#8217;s 2007 Deal Probed 
Innkeepers USA Trust&#8217;s unsecured creditors asked for an
investigation of the bankrupt company&#8217;s 2007 transaction with
Apollo Investment Corp., including fairness opinions issued by
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and UBS Securities LLC. 
A committee of the unsecured creditors on Aug. 17 asked the
bankruptcy court in Manhattan to authorize the probe and compel
other creditors, including Lehman and Apollo, to produce
documents and witnesses to determine whether the deal harmed the
hotel owner. The committee also wants to examine the validity of
secured creditors&#8217; claims and find out whether company
executives breached their fiduciary duties. 
Shareholders in Innkeepers are also seeking an
investigation of plans by Apollo Investment Corp. and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. to reorganize the bankrupt chain of
hotels. They said in their Aug. 12 request for a probe that the
proposal is unfair to creditors as well as shareholders. 
The deal would give Lehman all the hotel company&#8217;s stock,
which it would split with Apollo, squeezing out other creditors
and investors, a committee of preferred holders said in an Aug.
17 court filing. 
Lehman, which helped Apollo finance the 2007 buyout of
Innkeepers with a $1.2 billion loan, won court approval
yesterday to lend Innkeepers $17.5 million to help it
restructure. Lehman said last month that the refinancing would
help it recoup a secured claim. 
Innkeepers, whose parent is managed by an affiliate of Leon
Black&#8217;s private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, filed
for bankruptcy on July 19 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court with a pre-
arranged reorganization plan that has continued to draw
objections. 
The case is In re Innkeepers USA LP, 10-13794, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
QMG Winddown Wins Dismissal of Bankruptcy Case 
QMG Winddown Inc., formerly known as Questex Media Group
Inc., received a judge&#8217;s approval to end its bankruptcy case
after all potential recoveries for creditors were exhausted. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath granted the company&#8217;s
June 15 request and ordered the dismissal of the Chapter 11
case, according to court documents filed Aug. 17 in Wilmington,
Delaware. 
The Newton, Massachusetts-based company sold virtually all
its assets to lenders in exchange for about $120 million in debt
owed to them and the assumption of about $15 million used to
finance the bankruptcy case. The lenders left QMG with $500,000
to &#8220;wind down&#8221; the estate. 
&#8220;The creditors committee has investigated and determined
not to pursue any&#8221; potential lawsuits, lawyers for the company
said in court papers. 
Questex was a business-to-business media and information
provider with 23 trade publications, 150 digital media
publications and 28 conferences, trade shows and events. The
company listed assets of $299 million and debt totaling $321
million in Chapter 11 documents filed Oct. 5. 
The case is In re QMG Winddown Inc., 09-13423, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Watch list 
Highland Hotel Owner Explores Bankruptcy Filing, WSJ Says 
A real-estate investment firm led by Joseph E. Robert Jr.
is looking at a possible bankruptcy filing for Highland
Hospitality Corp., the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation. 
Financial difficulties at the hotel chain have led to
&#8220;maneuvering for control&#8221; of Highland between Robert&#8217;s JER
Partners private equity firm and creditors including Wells Fargo
 Co., Barclays Plc, Prudential Financial Inc. and Ashford
Hospitality Trust, the newspaper said. JER Partners bought
Highland for about $2.2 billion in 2007, according to the
newspaper. 
Highland may avoid bankruptcy court if it satisfies
creditors with more funds, and the company is in discussions
with potential investors including Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority about an injection of at least $200 million, according
to the report. 
JER Partners, Highland&#8217;s creditors and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority all declined to comment, the newspaper said.

Local Insight Debt Falls 48.75 Cents After Possible Breach 
Bonds of Local Insight Regatta Holdings Inc. tumbled the
most on record Aug. 17 after the directory publisher owned by
Welsh, Carson, Anderson  Stowe said it will likely breach the
terms of its loan agreement. 
The $210.5 million of 11 percent notes due in 2017 declined
48.75 cents to 23.75 cents on the dollar, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. 
Local Insight said terms of the loan agreement will become
&#8220;more stringent&#8221; and &#8220;it is likely the company will breach
the covenants under its credit facilities&#8221; at Sept. 30 and at
Dec. 31, the publisher disclosed in a regulatory filing.
Spokeswoman Pat Nichols couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for
comment. 
U.S. Credit-Default Swaps Benchmark Declines for Second Day 
A benchmark gauge of corporate credit risk in the U.S. fell
yesterday for the second day to the lowest since Aug. 10. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index Series
14, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate
debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 1.1 basis point
to a mid-price of 105.8 basis points as of 8:19 a.m. yesterday
in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index, which
typically declines as investor confidence improves and rises as
it deteriorates, fell 4.8 basis points over the two days. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, will revamp its $1.6 trillion asset
management unit to compete against investment firms such as
BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., a person
with direct knowledge of the changes said. 
George Gatch, 46, who has worked at JPMorgan since 1986,
will replace Eve Guernsey as chief executive officer of
Investment Management Americas, the person said, speaking
anonymously because the changes haven&#8217;t been announced publicly.
Gatch will assume Guernsey&#8217;s duties and keep running mutual fund
and retirement units, the person said. Gatch will work with a
new global manager overseeing the institutional business to be
named in September, according to an e-mail from Gatch to
employees dated Aug. 18. 
&#8220;Now is the time to ensure that we have a structure that
supports our future success as we confront challenges from
passive managers, ETFs and a generational shift in the way our
country saves for retirement,&#8221; Gatch said in the e-mail. So-
called passive managers typically follow indexes instead of
picking individual stocks. 
The changes underscore efforts by asset management head
Mary Callahan Erdoes, 42, to double revenue in five years,
expanding after competitors such as Bank of America Corp. and
Barclays Plc shed such units following the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. Erdoes previously ran JPMorgan&#8217;s
private bank and succeeded Jes Staley in September. Staley took
over the investment bank after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ousted
investment bank co-CEO Bill Winters. 
&#8216;Rounding Adjustment&#8217; 
Spokeswoman Mary Sedarat declined to comment on the
changes, which were reported earlier today by the New York
Times&#8217; Dealbook. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s asset management division, which generated $391
million in net income during the second quarter, provides the
bank with &#8220;a buffer to the variability of investment banking
revenues,&#8221; said Geoffrey Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in
East Greenwich, Rhode Island. For many large investment banks,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a rounding adjustment in good days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In bad
days, it may be the only source of revenue.&#8221; 
Garibaldi Named 
John Garibaldi will run institutional advisory and sales in
investment management, reporting to both Gatch and the new
global head for institutional clients, Gatch wrote in the e-
mail. Garibaldi replaces John Hunt, who is leaving in October,
the person with knowledge of the changes said. Guernsey is
retiring after 32 years at the bank. 
Gatch, who most recently ran the retail business for
investment management in North America, is one of three regional
division heads. Jamie Broderick will continue to run the retail
and institutional businesses for investment management in the
U.K., Europe and Latin America while David Hsu will do the same
in Asia, according to the person. All three report to Clive Brown, the chief operating officer for asset management, the
person said. 
JPMorgan ranked 12th among U.S.-based stock and bond mutual
fund managers as of June 30, according to Morningstar Inc. data.
The bank had $103 billion of assets under management, excluding
money market funds. The asset management unit oversees $1.6
trillion in investments, which includes $1.2 trillion it
directly manages. 
The bank, ranked second behind Bank of America in deposits
and assets among U.S. lenders, was the only large Wall Street
bank to remain profitable through the financial crisis.

Morgan Stanley, the most bearish
among the 18 primary dealers that trade government securities
with the Federal Reserve, acknowledged that its forecast that
Treasury yields would rise this year was misguided. 
&#8220;We got our rates call wrong and missed a great
opportunity to be long bonds this year,&#8221; James Caron, head of
U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York, wrote
in a note to clients yesterday. &#8220;The market is currently rife
with tactical relative value opportunities and that&#8217;s what we
will focus on going forward.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley had forecast that a strengthening U.S.
economy would lead to private credit demand, higher stock prices
and diminish the refuge appeal of Treasuries, pushing yields
higher. David Greenlaw, chief fixed-income economist at Morgan
Stanley, said in December that yields on benchmark 10-year notes
would climb about 40 percent to 5.5 percent, the biggest annual
increase since 1999. The New York-based firm reduced its
forecast to 4.5 percent in May and to 3.5 percent last week. 
Other primary dealers weren&#8217;t much better at predicting
yields, according to a March survey by Bloomberg News. Jefferies
Group Inc. said the 10-year would yield 4.75 percent by year-
end. Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Royal Bank of
Canada estimated a rise to 4.5 percent. The most accurate
dealers so far have been Goldman Sachs Group Inc., with an
estimate of 3.25 percent, and HSBC Holdings Plc at 3.3 percent. 
&#8216;Risk Weighted Return&#8217; 
The 10-year note yield fell as much as 4 basis points to
2.53 percent today, the lowest level since March 2009. Yields
have declined 10 basis points in the last five days and about 46
basis points in four weeks. 
Caron is advising clients to buy shorter-term Treasuries
maturing in 5 years or less and 1- and 2-year forward contracts. 
&#8220;If the Fed is going to be on hold for an extended period
of time, then that&#8217;s the sector that is going to perform the
best and it also has the best risk-weighted return,&#8221; Caron said
today in an interview with Thomas R. Keene on Bloomberg Radio. 
Morgan Stanley also recommends profiting from the narrowing
of the gap between the yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries. The
difference narrowed to 106 basis points today, after touching
125 basis points on Aug. 10. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s mainly about the 30-year bond yield coming lower,&#8221;
Caron said today, adding that 10-year yields may remain low as
the Fed buys more Treasuries. 
Treasury Purchases 
Policy makers began a purchase program on Aug. 17 to keep
borrowing costs low to foster economic growth by reinvesting
principal payments on mortgage-backed bonds and agency debt into
Treasuries. The Fed bought $6.16 billion in debt this week. It
acquired $300 billion of government debt last year. 
Caron is recommending that investors position for the Fed&#8217;s
purchase of Treasuries on Aug. 24, 25 and Sept.1. 
&#8220;We believe that U.S. Treasury 10-year yields will be
range-bound from 2.85 percent, where the Fed announced it would
buy U.S. Treasuries, to 2.40 percent near-term,&#8221; Caron wrote. 
Morgan Stanley also cited that it thought yields would
move higher because the Fed would be more likely to raise
interest rates in the first half of this year and the
unprecedented supply of Treasuries to weigh on prices, Caron
wrote. The market suggests the central bank will keep its target
rate for overnight loans between banks at a record-low range of
zero to 0.25 percent well into next year, he said. 
Shrinking credit markets may help explain why some Treasury
yields are at record lows even after the amount of marketable
government debt outstanding increased by 21 percent from a year
earlier to $8.18 trillion. 
&#8216;We&#8217;ve Been Wrong&#8217; 
While net issuance of Treasuries will rise by $1.2 trillion
this year, the net supply of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities and debt tied to consumer loans may recede by $1.3
trillion, according to Jeffrey Rosenberg, a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. 
Morgan Stanley may revise its forecast for 3.1 percent
gross domestic product growth this year if economic data
continues to be weak, Caron said today. The firm is
&#8220;unimpressed&#8221; with recent data, including unemployment claims,
payroll and retail sales, he said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve become a lot more short-term and tactical,&#8221; Caron
said. &#8220;Once in a while you have to say we&#8217;ve been wrong, and
here&#8217;s why and it&#8217;s time to move on.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s
largest brokerage, hired Jack O&#8217;Connor as head of North American
institutional sales for its investment-management unit. 
O&#8217;Connor ran U.S. institutional sales at Pioneer

Gregory Fleming, head of the investment-management

Fleming, a veteran of Merrill Lynch  Co., in December to run

assets under management as of March 31, an increase of about 4
percent from a year earlier, according to its website.

Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said it&#8217;s investigating an oil spill in
Angola, which vies with Nigeria as Africa&#8217;s top oil producer. 
The size and source of the leak are unknown, Chevron said
today in a statement. Oil washed up on a beach in the region of
Cabinda where Chevron&#8217;s local unit, the Cabinda Gulf Oil Co., is
the operator of two concessions with partners including Total SA
of France, Italy&#8217;s Eni SpA and Angola&#8217;s state oil company
Sonangol. 
&#8220;The origin of the material is not identified, but the
Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. immediately enacted its response plan for
spills in order to minimize the environmental impact,&#8221; Chevron
said. &#8220;The company reaffirms that the origin of the substance
is unknown.&#8221; 
The Chevron unit pumped about 500,000 barrels a day off the
coast of Cabinda last year, compared with Angola&#8217;s daily
production of 1.8 million barrels. Cabinda is an exclave of
Angola, separated from the rest of the country by a sliver of
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., won court approval to
move forward with its plan to exit bankruptcy as creditors
protest the proposal. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York yesterday
approved a summary of the plan, known as a disclosure statement.
Under the plan, General Growth would pay creditors in full and
provide a recovery to shareholders, which is unusual in a
bankruptcy case. 
General Growth resolved most objections to the disclosure
statement before yesterday&#8217;s hearing. Unsecured creditors still
have &#8220;significant&#8221; problems with the plan, said Michael
Stamer, an attorney for the group. Investors including Fairholme
Funds Inc. will be able to receive cash for General Growth bonds
to offset their investments, an option not available to other
bondholders. 
Heirs of Howard Hughes also have objected, saying they
won&#8217;t get the same recovery as creditors or shareholders.
Creditors can raise their objections when General Growth asks
Gropper to confirm the plan at an Oct. 21 hearing, he said. 
General Growth, based in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy last
year after failing to refinance its debt load. The company plans
to emerge from bankruptcy this year with $8.4 billion in
financing. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
Updates 
American Mortgage Bankruptcy Plan Terms Win Approval 
American Mortgage Acceptance Co., a real estate trust
formed in 1991, won approval of the terms of its plan to
reorganize by giving creditors stock in a new company. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in New York yesterday
approved a revised disclosure statement, or description of the
plan to exit bankruptcy. The new disclosure statement limits the
scope of third-party transfers, Glenn said. He had raised the
issue at an earlier hearing. 
The company will transfer some assets to Taberna Preferred
Funding I Ltd. to satisfy its claims. New common stock will be
issued to C3 Initial Assets LLC. Other unsecured claims will be
paid in full. Equity holders will get nothing. 
In June, the judge refused to approve an earlier draft of
the statement, which gave a blanket release to directors and
officers, prohibiting suits by shareholders and creditors. 
As soon as the company&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy becomes
effective, it will issue new preferred shares to fund
operations, according to court documents. It will maintain its
status as a real estate investment trust. 
Creditors have until Sept. 23 to vote on the plan. 
American Mortgage Acceptance filed for bankruptcy in April.
The company, which invests in mortgage loans and other debt
secured by property, had assets of $666.4 million as of Dec.31,
2007, according to court documents. The company&#8217;s holdings lost
value after the collapse of the market for mortgage-backed
securities, according to court papers. 
The case is In re American Mortgage Acceptance Co., 10-
12196, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. 
HSBC Should Reveal Reports on Madoff Risk, Judge Says 
HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest bank, should turn over
internal reviews of potential fraud and other operational risks
at Bernard Madoff&#8217;s business from 2006 and 2008, a New York
judge ruled. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, in an Aug. 17 ruling,
agreed to ask the High Court in London to order HSBC to hand
over reports, contracts, audio recordings and documents related
to examinations conducted by an affiliate of KPMG International.
HSBC acted as custodian bank for several funds that invested
with the con man. 
The last review was commissioned by HSBC in September 2008,
about three months before Madoff&#8217;s arrest, according to the
ruling. London-based HSBC and trustee Irving Picard in New York
reached an agreement on which documents should be turned over if
the order is issued, Manhattan court filings show. 
Picard is suing hedge funds and other parties that profited
from the $65 billion fraud to repay victims. Madoff, 72, pleaded
guilty last year and is serving a 150-year sentence. 
HSBC spokesman Adrian Russell said the company can&#8217;t
comment on ongoing litigation.

Goldman Mortgage Denied Protective Order in RQB Bankruptcy 
In the Chapter 11 case of RQB Resort LP and RQB Development
LP, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn yesterday denied a
renewed motion made by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., a unit of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., seeking a protective order, according
to court files. He did not provide a reason in the order. 
Glenn denied the request, writing that the denial was
&#8220;without prejudice to privileges and confidentiality of Goldman
Sachs Mortgage, which should be preserved and may be claimed.&#8221; 
The term &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; means the party is not
barred from asserting rights or claims in the future. 
Goldman Sachs Mortgage asked the court to issue an order
prohibiting the debtors from continuing the deposition of
Goldman Sachs Mortgage witnesses beyond the areas of inquiry
described in the debtors&#8217; notice of deposition. 
Goldman Sachs Mortgage said the topic described in the
notice of deposition related to the company&#8217;s valuation of
property underlying a $193 million loan. Goldman Sachs Mortgage
argued that discovery beyond valuation that probed loan analysis
methods should be recognized for its &#8220;irrelevance and highly
proprietary nature,&#8221; and therefore prohibited, it said in court
papers. 
The case is RQB Resort, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville). 
N.Y. State&#8217;s DiNapoli Reserves Right to Sue Lehman Executives 
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who urged the
appointment of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. examiner Anton
Valukas, said the $132.5 billion state retirement fund reserved
its &#8220;potential right to undertake appropriate actions to
recover the losses it sustained from its investments&#8221; in the
bankrupt investment bank. 
The New York State Common Retirement Fund lost $216.3
million over three years after it sold Lehman shares, which
traded as high as $82 each in 2007, at 14 cents to 30 cents a
share after the September 2008 bankruptcy, according to a court
filing yesterday. 
DiNapoli made the filing to object to Lehman&#8217;s disallowal
of the fund&#8217;s claim. 
The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York

Neff&#8217;s Creditors Ask to File Papers Under Seal 
Neff Corp.&#8217;s committee of unsecured creditors asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Shelley C. Chapman on Aug. 18 to let it file
under seal an &#8220;unredacted&#8221; version of a motion asking for
permission to prosecute lender claims. 
The final order on debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing
in the bankruptcy case would release Neff from obligations to
certain lien holders and bar claims or challenges against the
company. Aug. 18 was the deadline for challenging the order,
according to court papers. 
Previously, the committee filed a redacted version of the
motion for permission to bring claims challenging the DIP order.
The committee now seeks to file the motion under seal with
confidential information revealed. 
Responses to the motion must be filed by Sept. 3 and a
hearing on the request is set for Sept. 9. 
The case is In re Neff Corp., 10-12610, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York Manhattan). 
Foreclosure 
Ackman Group&#8217;s Stuyvesant Town Foreclosure Postponed 
A New York judge halted a foreclosure auction planned for
next week on Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Manhattan&#8217;s
biggest apartment complex, as creditors wrangle for control of
the property. 
A hearing will take place Sept. 2 on how to proceed,
according to a statement yesterday from CWCapital Asset
Management LLC, the special servicer for the senior mortgage on
the property. Bill Ackman&#8217;s Pershing Square Capital Management
LP and Winthrop Realty Trust had scheduled an Aug. 25
foreclosure auction after buying $300 million in defaulted
mezzanine debt. 
Senior lenders, who had been given permission to foreclose
in June, also agreed not to initiate an auction before the
hearing, according to an e-mailed statement from Pershing and
Winthrop. The two companies want to take control of the complex
under a plan that senior mortgage holders claim will put the 80-
acre property in bankruptcy. 
Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp, trustees for
holders of the $3 billion senior mortgage, sued to stop the
venture&#8217;s foreclosure yesterday. The complaint, filed in the New
York state Supreme Court in Manhattan, claims the Pershing and
Winthrop plan violates terms of an existing agreement among
creditors. New York State Supreme Court Justice Richard Lowe is
overseeing the case. 
As junior creditors, Pershing and Winthrop must pay senior
lenders $3.66 billion, which covers the first mortgage plus
interest and penalties, before they do anything that might put
them in control of the property, according to the lawsuit. 
The Pershing and Winthrop venture agreed to a &#8220;short
adjournment&#8221; of the auction until legal objections raised by
the senior lenders, represented by CWCapital, are resolved in
court, the companies said in the statement. 
Tishman Speyer Properties LP and BlackRock Inc. bought
Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village for $5.4 billion in 2006, a
record New York commercial real estate deal at the time. They
stopped payments on the $3 billion senior mortgage in January
after the development&#8217;s value sank and the owners failed to
raise rents as fast as anticipated. 
The case is Bank of America Corp. v. PSW NYC LLC, 10-
651293, New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan (New York
County). 
Statistics 
Municipal Bond Ratings Cuts Outnumber Upgrades, Fitch Reports 
Ratings cuts on U.S. state and municipal bonds outnumbered
increases for the sixth consecutive quarter amid lingering
budget pressures, the longest streak since at least 2002, Fitch
Ratings said. 
Fifty-seven public-finance issues representing $71.2
billion were downgraded and 36 valued at $28 billion were
upgraded in the three months ended June 30, Fitch said yesterday
in a report. The ratio of ratings cuts to increases was 1.6-to-
1. That&#8217;s down from the first quarter, when it was almost 2-to-
1. Fitch assigned negative outlooks to 246 credits in the second
quarter, down from 305 in the previous three-month period,
according to the report. That&#8217;s the first decrease in the number
of negative outlooks since the fourth quarter of 2007. More than
90 percent of ratings had a stable outlook on June 30, the
report said. 
In the tax-supported bond sector, downgrades outnumbered
upgrades by 44 to 18, Fitch said. 
Downgrades/Other Ratings Actions 
Transocean&#8217;s Senior Unsecured, Short-Term Ratings Downgraded 
Transocean Inc.&#8217;s senior unsecured and short-term ratings
were downgraded by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, the ratings
company said in a statement. 
The senior unsecured rating was downgraded Aug. 18 to Baa3
from Baa2. The downgrade was made with a &#8220;negative outlook,&#8221;
Moody&#8217;s said in the statement. The short-term rating was
downgraded to Prime-3 from Prime-2, Moody&#8217;s said. 
In addition, Moody&#8217;s also downgraded ratings for debt at
unit Transocean Worldwide Inc., which was formerly known as
Global Santa Fe, and at unit Global Marine Inc., to Baa3 from
Baa2. The ratings company left those two ratings under review
for further downgrade, it said in the statement. 
The downgrade to Baa3 is a result of Moody&#8217;s view that
Transocean &#8220;potentially faces significant liability exposure
due to its involvement in the blowout and subsequent oil spill
from the Macondo well and a concern as to whether it will be
fully protected under its indemnification from BP,&#8221; said Ken
Austin, Moody&#8217;s Vice President. 
DigitalGlobe&#8217;s Liquidity Rating Downgraded by Moody&#8217;s 
DigitalGlobe Inc.&#8217;s speculative grade liquidity rating has
been downgraded to SGL-3 from SGL-1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service, the rating company said in a statement. 
The action reflects Moody&#8217;s &#8220;concern that the accelerated
timeline of constructing the next generation imaging satellite,
WorldView-3, will weaken the company&#8217;s liquidity over the next
12 to 18 months,&#8221; according to the statement. 
Moody&#8217;s affirmed all of the company&#8217;s other ratings,
including the Ba3 corporate family rating, the Ba3 probability
of default rating, and the Ba3 rating on the senior secured
notes, the ratings company said in the statement. 
The outlook &#8220;remains stable,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said. 
Radio One on Review for Possible Downgrade by Moody&#8217;s 
Radio One Inc.&#8217;s ratings were placed on review for possible
downgrade by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, according to a statement
released by the ratings company. 
Approximately $650 million of rated debt is affected,
Moody&#8217;s said in the statement. The ratings placed on review
include Radio One&#8217;s Caa1 corporate family rating, and its Caa2
probability of default rating. 
The review stemmed from the company&#8217;s announcement that
Radio One&#8217;s bank group &#8220;blocked its August 15 interest payment
on the 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said
in the statement. The bank group &#8220;has the ability to block the
interest payment as Radio One has been in violation of the total
leverage covenant under its credit agreement as announced in
July,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said in the statement.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s cancer treatment
Sutent failed in a large-scale study to improve overall survival
in patients with a form of lung cancer. 
The drug, when combined with Roche AG&#8217;s Tarceva, improved
the length of time patients lived without their tumor
progressing, though that didn&#8217;t translate into an overall
benefit in survival when compared with Tarceva alone, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. 
Sutent was approved in 2006 to treat cancer of the kidneys
and digestive tract by chocking off a tumor&#8217;s blood supply.
Researchers from Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
theorized the drug would show similar effects in other tumor
types and began studying it in a wide range of cancers. Since
its approval, Sutent has failed to show a benefit in cancer of
the liver, breast, and colon. 
&#8220;We believe that the statistically significant improvement
in progression free survival is an important finding,&#8221; said
Mace Rothenberg, vice president of clinical development and
medical affairs for cancer at Pfizer, in the statement. &#8220;Over
the next few months, we will conduct an in-depth analysis to
gain further insight into these results and determine whether we
can identify one or more subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer
patients for a future trial in either previously untreated or
recurrent disease.&#8221; 
Further Analysis 
Pfizer said it will analyze the results to see if there
were any subgroups of patients who may have benefited. The
drugmaker is continuing to study Sutent for certain types of
prostate cancer and kidney cancer, the statement said. 
Today&#8217;s study was from the final stages of testing required
to get U.S. approval for treating advanced non-small cell lung
cancer. In the study, Pfizer looked at the effects of Sutent in
combination with Tarceva in about 900 previously treated
patients. The company started the study in September 2007. 
Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn&#8217;t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. 
Pfizer said it plans to release the full results of the
study, called SUN-1087, in October at the European Society for
Medical Oncology Congress in Italy.

A California man accused of leaking
Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s earnings information pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and wire fraud in Manhattan federal court. 
Yonni Sebbag, 30, and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, the
former assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, were arrested in California on May 26 for leaking
confidential stock tips about the entertainment company&#8217;s
earnings. Sebbag has been jailed since his arrest. 
&#8220;From March 2010 to May 26, 2010, I agreed with others to
commit securities fraud and wire fraud,&#8221; Sebbag told U.S.
Magistrate Judge James Cott in Manhattan today. &#8220;I disclosed
material, non-public information about the Walt Disney Company
to outside investors,&#8221; he said, adding later, &#8220;I transmitted
via electronic mail that material, non-public information.&#8221; 
Sebbag, who is a Moroccan citizen, faces deportation and a
prison term of as long as 33 months in prison when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, Cott said. 
Prosecutors say Sebbag sent letters in March to at least 33
investment companies, including hedge funds, offering to sell
confidential information about Burbank, California-based Disney. 
On March 11, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation began reaching out to the pair, according to a
criminal information filed in New York. On May 8, the two gave
undercover FBI agents internal Disney documents, according to
the filing. 
None of the funds acted on the tips, a person familiar with
the matter said. Disney said it cooperated with prosecutors. 
Wire Fraud 
The charge of wire fraud carries a statutory term of as
long as 20 years in prison, Cott said today. As part of his
guilty plea, Sebbag also agreed to forfeit the $15,000 he
received from the undercover FBI agent as part of a scheme. The
government said the evidence against Sebbag included audiotape
and videotaped evidence of Sebbag soliciting the FBI agent who
was posing as a hedge fund manager. 
His lawyer, Steven Kartagener, said his client isn&#8217;t
cooperating with prosecutors. 
&#8220;Mr. Sebbag has come forward and accepted full
responsibility for his misconduct,&#8221; Kartagener said in an
interview after court. &#8220;The foundation of this guilty plea was
a fair basis to go forward and ultimately resolve this matter.&#8221; 
Cott set a Nov. 16 court date in the case. No sentencing
date has been set by Judge Jones, Cott said. 
Criminal charges are pending are pending against Hoxie, who
remains free on bail. Her lawyer, Robert Baum, couldn&#8217;t be
immediately be reached for comment. 
The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

The Federal Reserve will probably

Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
New York. 
&#8220;The Fed will eventually move to additional monetary
stimulus via asset purchases or other unconventional measures,&#8221;
Hatzius said in a radio interview today with Tom Keene on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance.&#8221; Should the Fed opt for more
securities purchases, he said, there is &#8220;no point in doing
anything less than&#8221; $1 trillion. 
Fed policy makers on Aug. 10 made their first attempt to
bolster the economy in more than a year, saying they will
maintain their holdings of securities at $2.05 trillion to
prevent money from draining out of the financial system. The
Federal Open Market Committee, in its statement, said &#8220;the pace
of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent
months.&#8221; 
Sales of previously owned U.S. homes slumped 27 percent in
July, the National Association of Realtors said today in a
report that pointed to further weakening of the economy.
Hatzius, speaking before the home-sales data, predicted gross
domestic product will expand at a 1.5 percent annual pace in the
second half of the year, and unemployment will rise to 10
percent next year from 9.5 percent currently.

Investors face defaults on
government bonds given the burden of aging populations and the
difficulty of increasing tax revenue, according to a Morgan
Stanley executive director. 
&#8220;Governments will impose a loss on some of their
stakeholders,&#8221; Arnaud Mares in the firm&#8217;s London office wrote
in a research report today. &#8220;The question is not whether they
will renege on their promises, but rather upon which of their
promises they will renege, and what form this default will
take.&#8221; The sovereign-debt crisis is global &#8220;and it is not
over,&#8221; he wrote. 
Rather than miss principal and interest payments,
governments may choose a &#8220;soft&#8221; default in which they pay back
debts with devalued currencies resulting from faster inflation
or force creditors to take lower returns, Mares said in an
interview. 
Borrowing costs for so-called peripheral euro-region
nations from Greece to Ireland surged today, resuming their
ascent on concern that governments won&#8217;t be able to cut their
budget deficits. Standard  Poor&#8217;s lowered Ireland&#8217;s credit
rating yesterday on the rising cost of supporting nationalized
banks. 
Population trends may be a better predictor of the ability
to meet obligations rather than debt as a percentage of gross
domestic product, which doesn&#8217;t reflect governments&#8217; available
revenue and is &#8220;backward-looking,&#8221; Mares wrote. 
While the U.S. government&#8217;s debt is 53 percent of GDP, one
of the lowest ratios among developed nations, its debt as a
percentage of revenue is 358 percent, one of the highest, the
report said. Italy has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios, at
116 percent, yet has a debt-to-revenue ratio of 188, Mares said. 
Double Dip 
&#8220;Outright sovereign default in large advanced economies
remains an extremely unlikely outcome, in our view,&#8221; the report
said. &#8220;But current yields and break-even inflation rates
provide very little protection against the credible threat of
financial oppression in any form it might take.&#8221; 
Mares, who didn&#8217;t identify which nations may default, once
worked at the U.K.&#8217;s Debt Management Office and is a former
senior vice-president at credit-rating company Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service. 
&#8220;Note that a double-dip recession would not invalidate
this conclusion,&#8221; Mares&#8217; report said. &#8220;It would cause yet
further damage to the governments&#8217; power to tax, pushing them
further in negative equity and therefore increasing the risks
that debt holders suffer a larger loss eventually.&#8221; 
Investor concern that the U.S. may fall back into recession
has grown in recent weeks as data missed economists&#8217; estimates.
A Citigroup Inc. index of U.S. economic data surprises fell to
minus 59 last week, the least since January 2009. 
Credit-Default Swaps 
A report from the Commerce Department today showed U.S.
durable goods orders increased 0.3 percent, compared with the 3
percent median estimate of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, figures showed today in Washington. The number of
unemployment claims unexpectedly shot up by 12,000 to 500,000 in
the week ended Aug 14, Labor Department figures showed Aug. 19. 
Yields on German and U.S. benchmark securities sank today
as investors sought the safest assets. U.S. two-year Treasury
yields, at a four-month high 1.18 percent on April 5, fell to a
record low 0.4542 percent yesterday. 
Greek Debt Yields 
The yield on Greek debt rose to more than 900 basis points
above that of Germany today, the most since the European Union
and International Monetary Fund created a 750 billion-euro ($948
billion) bailout package in May. Greece&#8217;s so-called yield spread
over German debt was at 932 basis points as of 2:18 p.m. in
London, short of the 973 basis-point record set on May 7. The
Irish-German yield spread rose to a record 347 basis points,
from 318 points yesterday. 
Credit-default swaps that insure Irish government bonds
against non-payment for five years rose 21 basis points to 331
today, the most since March 2009, according to data provider
CMA. Greek swaps jumped to 921.5, the most since June, from 896. 
&#8220;The conflict that opposes bondholders to other government
stakeholders is more intense than ever, and their interests are
no longer sufficiently well-aligned with those of influential
political constituencies,&#8221; such as elderly voters and their
claims on pensions and health insurance, Mares wrote.

Morgan Stanley today ended a bet
against the euro as U.S. economic weakness may &#8220;take a while&#8221;
to influence Europe while the Federal Reserve moves closer to
easing policy further.  
&#8220;While we have been very vocal in recent weeks calling for
dollar strength against the euro, the risk-reward has
deteriorated and the risks of further easing measures by the
Federal Reserve on September 21 are perhaps building,&#8221; analysts
led by London-based Stephen Hull wrote in a note today.
&#8220;While it is likely that European data will eventually slow if
the current bout of weakness in U.S. data continues, it might
take a while to feed through.&#8221; 
The short euro-dollar bet had a 20 percent weighting in the
strategy team&#8217;s portfolio of trade recommendations and was ended
with a profit of 326 basis points, or 3.26 percentage points,
the analysts wrote. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.2638 as of

Goldman Sachs Chief Global Economist
Jim O&#8217;Neill said a spate of &#8220;disappointing&#8221; U.S. economic
reports may prompt the Federal Reserve to embark on a fresh
round of quantitative easing. 
Recent reports on jobless claims and manufacturing point to
slower growth in the world&#8217;s largest economy. Sales of existing
houses plunged by a record 27 percent in July, figures from the
National Association of Realtors showed yesterday. 
&#8220;If we carry on with data like this, yes, it&#8217;s coming,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said, referring to quantitative easing. He spoke in an
interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack&#8221; with Deirdre
Bolton today. &#8220;September might be a little bit soon, but by
October I would say for sure if the data carries on being as
disappointing as it&#8217;s been.&#8221; 
Fed policy makers on Aug. 10 made their first attempt to

Fed officials held mixed views of the outlook, according to

&#8220;thought inflation was unlikely to fall appreciably.&#8221;

ninth last year and as high as third place in 2003, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its share of this year&#8217;s $1.9
trillion in global offerings dipped to 3.7 percent, from an
average 4.8 percent in the previous 10 years. 
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is working to
restore the New York-based firm&#8217;s reputation as an advocate for
its customers after agreeing last month to pay a record fine to
settle U.S. allegations it misled clients over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 35,000 employees help
governments finance schools and roads and provide advice and
capital to companies &#8220;to invest in their growth,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said before Congress in April. 
&#8220;Goldman is struggling a little bit here,&#8221; said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida. &#8220;It
has to overcome some pretty sizable public relations issues,
which are related to the way it does business and the products
it creates. The company is good enough to overcome all of this
stuff, but it would be hard for me to imagine that there&#8217;s no
impact as a result of what we&#8217;ve seen over the last 12 to 18
months.&#8221; 
Taking &#8216;a Hit&#8217; 
Blankfein has said the firm&#8217;s clients have stuck with it
after agreeing to pay a $550 million fine to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission in connection with allegations that it
misled investors in securities that bet on subprime mortgages.
While not acknowledging or refuting improper conduct, Goldman
Sachs said it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; by failing to disclose a hedge
fund that helped construct the investment was also planning to
bet against it. 
&#8220;Definitely Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation took a hit,&#8221;
Blankfein said in a Bloomberg Television interview in May. &#8220;And
that&#8217;s certainly reflected in people&#8217;s attitudes to the firm
now. And that&#8217;s something that we have to work on.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs has retained its top spot in advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions, with 165 deals this year
and is second in equity offerings, with a 9.5 percent market
share of the $258 billion raised. Equity offerings amount to 13
percent of the total raised through corporate bonds this year. 
Bond Bonanza 
&#8220;When you think of Goldman Sachs and you think of our investment-banking and our market-making across the board and
our money-management, we have one of the biggest client
franchises out there, maybe the biggest,&#8221; Blankfein said.
&#8220;This is a tough, competitive market with clients that can
sometimes border on the cynical in terms of their
expectations.&#8221; 
 Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s bond underwriting business. 
Deposit-rich lenders JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG have climbed in the league tables at the expense of Goldman
Sachs as companies tap the bond market for some of the lowest
yields on record. The banks began to dominate the market more
than a decade ago after the repeal of Depression-era laws that
separated investment and commercial banking. They won business
in part by using their bigger balance sheets to lend directly to
companies. 
Banks Rise 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is leading global
underwriting for the third straight year while Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest lender, is ranked second, up from an average
rank of 4.6, Bloomberg data show. New York-based JPMorgan has a
6.8 percent share of the market, down from an average 7.3
percent, while Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has 5.9 percent, up
from an average 5.5 percent. 
 Barclays Capital in London, which bought Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s North American division in 2008, has climbed to
fourth from an average of eighth. 
Goldman Sachs also has dropped in U.S. corporate bond
underwriting, where it holds a bigger share. The bank is sixth
this year, down from as high as third in 2005, Bloomberg data
show. Its U.S. share has dwindled to 7.3 percent from as high as
9 percent in 2005 and an average of 7.9 percent the previous 10
years. 
Core Deposits 
Borrowers want an underwriter that has &#8220;the balance-sheet
strength of a real commercial bank with investment banking
capabilities as opposed to an investment bank with these nominal
commercial banking facilities like Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. 
JPMorgan had quarterly average assets of $1.99 trillion
last year, including $112.8 billion in commercial and industrial
loans, Federal Reserve filings show. It held $548.2 billion of
core deposits. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s quarterly average assets of
$880.3 billion included $1.5 billion of commercial and
industrial loans. It had core deposits of $19.4 billion. 
JPMorgan is &#8220;generally bullish on opportunities across
markets,&#8221; Therese Esperdy, the global head of debt capital
markets at the bank in New York, said in a statement.
Spokespeople for Deutsche Bank and Barclays didn&#8217;t comment. 
Goldman Sachs is holding steady in businesses where profit
margins are highest. It&#8217;s second in global equity underwritings,
in line with an average rank of 1.7 the previous 10 years,
Bloomberg data show. The average fee in that market this year
has been 3.3 percent, compared with 0.5 percent in corporate
bond underwriting. 
MA Dominance 
It also has advised on more mergers and acquisitions than
any other firm, with $289.7 billion in deals this year. MA
advisory generates about 40 percent of the investment-banking
industry&#8217;s revenue, according to a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
report reviewing the industry&#8217;s performance from 2000 to 2007. 
Trading of fixed-income securities and derivatives,
currencies and commodities generated an unprecedented $7.39
billion of revenue in the first quarter for Goldman Sachs,
following overall record net earnings of $13.4 billion in 2009. 
Goldman Sachs averaged $348.5 million a quarter in revenue
from debt underwriting the last 20 quarters. That&#8217;s less than 10
percent of the average $3.68 billion a quarter during the same
period from trading in fixed income, currency and commodity
markets, data compiled by Bloomberg from earnings presentations
show. 
Expanding Competition 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a little early to tell that there&#8217;s been major
reputational damage,&#8221; said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit analyst
at BNP Paribas in New York. &#8220;In periods of lower economic
growth, there tends to be less financing needs and less MA and
advisory business, and therefore it is a negative for investment
banking in general.&#8221; 
Part of the erosion may be at the expense of all
underwriters as competition intensifies. The average amount of
deals for the top 10 underwriters has shrunk to $93.4 billion
this year from $118.7 billion in the corresponding period of
2007. 
New bond issues earned bankers $18.8 billion in fees in
2009 from debt underwriting, a 31 percent increase over 2008 and
equal to the record set in 2007, Bloomberg data show. 
Securities firms haven&#8217;t dominated debt underwriting league
tables since 1999 when Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act.
For more than 60 years, the law separated investment and
commercial banking by prohibiting federally insured banks from
underwriting securities and other investment banking activities. 
Merrill Lynch  Co., which was bought in 2009 by Bank of
America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were ranked
first, third and fourth in global bond underwriting in 1999,
with a combined market share of 19.4 percent. 
&#8220;Historically, they were 1, 2 or 3,&#8221; Geisst, 63, the
author of &#8220;Wall Street: A History,&#8221; said of Goldman Sachs
before the repeal of Glass-Steagall. 
From 2000 to 2009, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s average rank in global
corporate bond underwriting was 6.7. Morgan Stanley, which
slipped to seventh the past two years, averaged 5.4 percent. Its
share this year is 4 percent, down from an average 5.3 percent.

Morgan Stanley hired Sean Chao, a
UBS AG veteran of almost 18 years, as chief executive officer of
its Taiwan unit. 
Chao, 55, will join the New York-based bank in early
December and be based in Taipei, Morgan Stanley said in an e-
mailed statement today. He was head of UBS&#8217;s Taiwan operations. 
Morgan Stanley ranks first in advising on mergers and
acquisitions involving Taiwanese companies this year, while UBS
is fourth, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Wall Street firm
is seeking to expand its fixed-income and private-banking
businesses in Taiwan, according to the statement. 
Chao will replace Gary Kuo, who quit in July. Kuo joined
Barclays Plc as co-head of investment banking for China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan, two people with knowledge of the matter said
last month. 
Chao joined UBS in Taipei in 1993 after working at Westpac
Banking Corp. in Sydney and Taipei. He was UBS&#8217;s head of Taiwan
investment banking from 1993 to 2004, and chairman of asset
management on the island from 2004 to 2005, Morgan Stanley said. 
Chris Cockerill, a spokesman at UBS in Hong Kong, confirmed
that Chao left the firm this month. 
Morgan Stanley is advising MBK Partners Ltd. on the sale of
a stake in Taiwan&#8217;s China Network Systems Co., and helping
American International Group Inc. sell its Taiwan insurance unit.

Morgan Stanley sold $772.8 million
of 15-year callable step-up notes in the largest offering of
structured notes by a bank in the U.S. this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The securities, sold Aug. 26, pay 5 percent interest
initially, according to a prospectus filed today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The rate rises to 5.5
percent after three years, then to 6 percent in 2016, 7 percent
in 2019 and 10 percent in 2022. Morgan Stanley has quarterly
options to redeem, or call, the securities for face value after
one year. 
Morgan Stanley has issued $3.5 billion of callable step-up
notes in the U.S. this year, more than all other banks combined,
Bloomberg data show. The New York-based bank sold $700 million
of the securities on July 27, according to another prospectus. 
Distributors of the 15-year notes, including the bank&#8217;s
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage unit, received a 2.25
percent commission, according to the prospectus.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and
15 other banks are competing to manage the share sale of state-
run Steel Authority of India Ltd., part of a record asset-sale
program by the government. 
The banks will be asked to make presentations on Aug. 31
and Sept. 1, Steel Secretary Atul Chaturvedi said today in a
phone interview from New Delhi. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America
Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc.
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. also submitted bids for managing
the public offer, likely to be made in January, he said. 
Steel Authority plans to sell a 5 percent stake and the
government will sell an equal share in a follow-on public sale.
The offer is part of the Indian government&#8217;s plan to sell a
record 400 billion rupees ($8.5 billion) of assets this year as
it aims to contain fiscal deficit. 
&#8220;We plan to have at least five banks for managing the
share sale,&#8221; Chaturvedi said. 
Shares of Steel Authority rose as much as 1.9 percent to
188.75 rupees and traded at 188.15 rupees as of 12:17 p.m. in
Mumbai. The key Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was little changed. 
Share sales by government-controlled companies are
producing near-zero fees for Wall Street banks that charge an
average of about 4 percent of money raised for U.S. offerings,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. As many as 20 banks still
compete for each state sale, betting the league-table credits
will help them win more investment-banking work in Asia&#8217;s third-
largest economy.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. told traders
who bet on commodities for the firm&#8217;s account that their unit
will be closed as the company, the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, starts to shut down all proprietary trading, according
to a person briefed on the matter. 
The bank eventually will close all in-house trading to
comply with new U.S. curbs on investment banks, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s
decision hasn&#8217;t been made public. 
Closing the proprietary trading desk for commodities
affects fewer than 20 traders, one in the U.S. and the rest in
the U.K., the person said. The unit is based in London, and
traders there were given notice on Aug. 27 that their jobs were
at risk as required by U.K. law, according to the person.
Proprietary traders in fixed-income and equities, who account
for 50 to 75 employees, will need to find jobs when those desks
are shut down, this person said. 
Congress passed restrictions on financial firms this year
designed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 credit crisis,
which almost caused the banking system to collapse. Proprietary
trading involves transactions made on behalf of the bank rather
than its customers. The curbs are known as the Volcker rule,
named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who
campaigned for limits on risk-taking by lenders. 
The Volcker rule may cost JPMorgan as much as $1.4 billion
in annual profit, analysts at Barclays Capital led by Jason Goldberg estimated in a June 28 research report. 
Revenue Goes Away 
&#8220;This revenue and the risk it carries with it now goes
away,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a Federal Reserve Bank of New
York analyst in the 1980s and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. &#8220;This will put more pressure
on JPM to look for growth outside the U.S. market.&#8221; 
JPMorgan traders will be given a chance to apply for jobs
elsewhere in the company, according to the person. JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kimberly Weinrick declined to comment. 
Coal derivatives trader Chan Bhima, who made a bad bet on
coal prices that the New York Post said cost JPMorgan as much as
$250 million in the second quarter, isn&#8217;t affected by the cuts,
the person said. The proprietary trading desk reports to
commodities head Blythe Masters, who discussed Bhima&#8217;s trade and
other matters in a July conference call with her team. 
U.S. banks are exploring ways to comply with the new
trading rules. Citigroup Inc. was looking at three options to
meet the new rule, including moving a team of proprietary
traders into its hedge-fund unit, people briefed on the matter
said in July. The bank would set up the traders as hedge-fund
managers and seed their funds, then raise money from outside
investors to redeem its stakes, the people said.

Pfizer Inc. and Bayer AG revealed
study results today that may give their medicines a foothold in
a $10-billion-a-year market to prevent clots that cause strokes
and deadly lung damage. 
The research provided evidence that Pfizer&#8217;s apixaban and
Bayer&#8217;s Xarelto are as safe as existing therapy, which may ease
concerns among doctors who are seeking a replacement for
warfarin, a powerful and unwieldy blood thinner used for more
than a half-century. Apixaban beat aspirin at preventing strokes
in patients with irregular heartbeat, while Xarelto matched
standard treatments for clots in the legs and lungs. 
At stake is a share in a warfarin-replacement market that
could reach $10 billion to $20 billion a year, according to an
estimate from Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann 
Co. Doctors and patients will &#8220;insist&#8221; on using a replacement
as soon as one is available for warfarin, which requires regular
blood tests and can leave patients vulnerable to deadly clots or
uncontrollable bleeding at too low or high a dose, said Ralph
Brindis, president of the American College of Cardiology and a
cardiologist at Oakland Medical Center in California. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re getting pretty close to the holy grail in finding a
replacement for warfarin,&#8221; Brindis said in an interview. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know which one is going to win or lose in that family, but
the body of evidence is growing.&#8221; 
Pfizer rose 5 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $15.91 at 4 p.m. in

Boehringer&#8217;s Pradaxa 
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH may be the first drugmaker to win
U.S. approval of a revolutionary alternative to warfarin, which
is derived from rat poison. U.S. regulatory advisers will review
Pradaxa, already approved in Europe to prevent clots following
hip and knee surgery, on Sept. 20. 
Pradaxa, apixaban and Xarelto interfere with the body&#8217;s own
clotting mechanisms to minimize strokes, lung clots and extended
leg clots, commonly at a risk of increased bleeding, Brindis
said. Apixaban, which is still being tested, and Xarelto, which
is approved in Europe for hip and knee surgery patients, appear
to be effective and safe, perhaps safer than the current
standard, he said. 
Apixaban Results 
Patients who took apixaban were 54 percent less likely to
have a stroke or damaging clot than those who took aspirin in a
study of 5,600 patients who couldn&#8217;t use warfarin, researchers
said today at the European Society of Cardiology conference in
Stockholm. Apixaban and aspirin showed a similar risk of major
bleeding, a feared side effect of blood thinners, according to
the study, dubbed Averroes after a 12th century Islamic
philosopher. 
&#8220;The use of aspirin will probably be reduced after this
study,&#8221; said Harald Arnesen, a professor at Ullevaal University
Hospital in Oslo. 
Warfarin typically reduces the rate of stroke 40 percent
more than aspirin, Larry Biegelsen, a New York-based analyst for
Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30.
That&#8217;s a less potent effect than apixaban showed in today&#8217;s
trial. 
Results from the larger 18,000-patient Aristotle study
comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with an irregular
heartbeat called atrial fibrillation are expected in the first
half of next year, Tim Anderson, a New York-based analyst with
Bernstein Research, said today in a note to clients. 
Xarelto Results 
&#8220;Aspirin isn&#8217;t the recommended treatment simply because
there&#8217;s significant amounts of clinical data that shows that in
fact protection is greater on warfarin,&#8221; said Nick Turner, a
London-based analyst at Mirabaud Securities, in a telephone
interview today. &#8220;So exactly how well a drug compares to
aspirin is probably not that significant.&#8221; 
Xarelto matched the standard therapy of Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s
Lovenox plus warfarin at blocking blood clots in the lungs and
legs, researchers said today in a study of more than 3,400
patients. Some 2.1 percent of those in the Xarelto group
developed clots compared with 3 percent of people taking the
older standard treatments. 
Patients who took Xarelto were 33 percent less likely to
develop either clots or major internal bleeding, Bayer said. The
Leverkusen, Germany-based drugmaker is developing Xarelto with
Johnson  Johnson. About 8.1 percent of patients in both
treatment groups developed serious bleeding, the study found. 
The company designed the study, dubbed Einstein-DVT, to see
whether the once-a-day pill could match the existing therapies,
which are &#8220;very, very effective,&#8221; said lead researcher Harry Bueller, of Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. 
Bayer&#8217;s Plans 
Medicines to prevent clots after knee surgery or in the
lungs and legs are a small part of the blood thinner market,
said Flemming Oernskov, head of the women&#8217;s health and general
medicine unit at Bayer. The much bigger market is in atrial
fibrillation, Oernskov said in an interview. 
Bayer has said it plans to present its trial on Xarelto
versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients at the American
Heart Association conference in November. 
&#8220;We think that when all indications are there, we have all
the trials and it has worked out well, it could be for us as a
company over 2 billion euros in annual revenue,&#8221; the Bayer
executive said. &#8220;You can imagine this market will be several
factors higher than the 2 billion euros.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. asked a federal
judge to throw out a lawsuit by bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., accusing the bank of helping cause its collapse. 
The New York-based lender, in papers filed with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck in Manhattan on Aug. 25, said
that when the securities firm teetered on the brink of collapse
in 2008, it was the only major bank that continued to extend
credit to it. 
&#8220;JPMorgan typically extended more than $100 billion in
credit each day to LBI for the settlement and clearance of its
securities transactions,&#8221; the bank&#8217;s attorneys said in the
filing. 
The case is scheduled to be tried in 2012 in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. 
Lehman Brothers, with $639 billion in assets, filed the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008. In May,
the New York-based firm sued the bank, alleging that JPMorgan
took advantage of the stricken firm. 
&#8220;On the brink of LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy, JPMorgan leveraged its
life and death power as the brokerage firm&#8217;s primary clearing
bank to force LBHI into a series of one-sided agreements and to
siphon billions of dollars in critically needed assets,&#8221; Lehman
said in the complaint. 
Securities, Real Estate 
Peck in March approved the bank&#8217;s return of $9 billion in
illiquid securities and difficult-to-value real estate to
Lehman, and its taking back cash and collateral from the firm.
The combatants reserved the right to later challenge and defend
the legitimacy of their claims. 
Lehman, in its May complaint, alleged JPMorgan -- which was
its main short-term lender before the bankruptcy -- helped cause
its collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral as credit
markets contracted in 2008. 
JPMorgan &#8220;could have avoided the vast bulk of its exposure
by declining to extend credit to LBI on any morning,&#8221; the
lender&#8217;s lawyers said in their request. 
The bankruptcy case is In Re: Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). 
The adversarial proceeding is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s experimental blood
thinner apixaban beat aspirin in a study that may open the door
to a $10 billion-a-year market to prevent clots that cause
strokes and deadly lung damage. 
Patients who took the Pfizer drug were 54 percent less
likely to have a stroke or damaging clot than those who took
aspirin in a study of 5,600 patients who couldn&#8217;t use the
standard therapy warfarin, researchers said today at the
European Society of Cardiology conference in Stockholm. Apixaban
and aspirin showed a similar risk of major bleeding, a feared
side effect of blood thinners. 
About half of the 2.2 million Americans with atrial
fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that increases the
likelihood of clots, don&#8217;t take warfarin because of side effects
or the need for constant monitoring, studies show. Today&#8217;s
results leave &#8220;no competition for apixaban in the foreseeable
future&#8221; for that group of patients and signal the drug could
challenge warfarin, said lead investigator Stuart Connolly, of
the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University
in Ontario, Canada. 
&#8220;You can definitely conclude that apixaban is going to
have a markedly improved safety profile compared to warfarin,&#8221;
Connolly said in an interview in Stockholm. &#8220;You can also
anticipate that apixaban is going to be at least as good as
warfarin and probably better than warfarin in efficacy.&#8221; 
Warfarin typically reduces the rate of stroke 40 percent
more than aspirin, Larry Biegelsen, a New York-based analyst for
Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30.
That&#8217;s a lower rate than apixaban showed in today&#8217;s trial.
Results from a larger 18,000-patient study comparing apixaban
with warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients are expected early
next year, Barbara Ryan, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in New
York, said in a note to clients. 
Replacing Warfarin 
Pfizer, partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., is racing
to challenge German drugmaker Boehringer-Ingelheim GmbH in the
market for pills to replace warfarin. Crafted from rat poison 65
years ago, warfarin can cause fatal bleeding at high doses and
leave patients vulnerable to clots if too little is given. 
Aspirin is the only alternative now for irregular heartbeat
patients for whom warfarin is too risky, Connolly said. 
&#8220;This is a major advance for these patients,&#8221; the
researcher said. &#8220;The effects are really important to
individuals, and they&#8217;re going to be important to society.&#8221; 
Atrial fibrillation means the heart doesn&#8217;t properly pump
blood out of its upper chamber, allowing it to pool and clot,
according to the American Heart Association. A stroke can result
if part of that clot breaks off and gets lodged in the artery to
the brain. 
Trial Stopped 
Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, both based in New York, stopped
their Averroes study comparing apixaban to aspirin ahead of
schedule in June, after an early analysis showed it cut the rate
of strokes and certain clots. Both companies are looking for new
drugs to plug a hole in revenue after their top-selling pills
face generic competition. 
Pfizer will start losing the majority of revenue next year
for its cholesterol pill Lipitor, the top-selling drug in the
world with $11.4 billion in sales last year. Meanwhile, Bristol-
Myers is likely to face competition in the U.S. in 2012 for
Plavix, the anti-clotting drug it markets with Sanofi-Aventis
SA. 
The companies may ask regulators to approve apixaban for
irregular heartbeat patients on the basis of the Averroes trial
alone, Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann  Co.,
wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30. The market for warfarin
replacements may be worth $10 billion to $20 billion a year,
Fernandez wrote in an earlier note. 
Bayer Data 
Apixaban may face competition from Xarelto, an anti-clot
pill from Bayer AG and Johnson  Johnson, as well as from
Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s Pradaxa. In a separate study released at
the meeting in Stockholm today, Bayer said Xarelto was as safe
and effective as the standard therapy of Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s
Lovenox plus warfarin at preventing blood clots in the lungs and
legs. 
Bayer has said it will issue data on how its blood thinner
Xarelto matched up against warfarin at the American Heart
Association&#8217;s meeting in November. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
scheduled to review Pradaxa on Sept. 20. The blood thinner beat
warfarin at preventing strokes in atrial fibrillation patients
last year in a trial. 
"These medications are going to change the practice in the
United States," Ralph Brindis, president of the American College
of Cardiology and a cardiologist at Oakland Medical Center, told
journalists before today&#8217;s results were released. Being first to
market in the U.S. "is huge," he said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $484.6
million of bonds backed by a loan to Centro Properties Group,
the Australian shopping center owner that said in July it
received a loan extension on $2.3 billion in debt. 
The largest top-rated portion of the bond, containing $272
million in debt maturing in 10 years, yields 165 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the sale who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t public. Similar securities sold in 2006 and 2007,
when property values peaked in the U.S., yesterday yielded about
2.68 percentage points more than Treasuries maturing in about
the same time, according to Barclays Plc data. 
Wall Street is seeking to revive the market for bonds
backed by commercial property loans after issuance plummeted 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan&#8217;s Centro
deal is the sixth sale this year. The most recent offering, also
tied to a single loan, was a $660 million deal for Vornado
Realty Trust last month. 
Half of this year&#8217;s sales have been linked to properties of
a single borrower. In 2007, offerings of as much as $7.6 billion
contained as many as 300 loans from multiple U.S. borrowers,
Bloomberg data show. 
Commercial property values have tumbled 41 percent since
2007, according to the Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price
Index. Landlords are having trouble paying off existing loans
amid tighter underwriting standards and lower occupancy rates
for hotels, skyscrapers, apartments and warehouses. 
Centro&#8217;s net loss for the year ended June 30 was A$652.7
million ($582.9 million) compared with a net loss of A$3.5
billion a year earlier, the Melbourne-based company said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange yesterday. The
company wrote down A$487.9 million of properties, compared with
A$2.7 billion last year. 
The shares slipped 5.7 percent yesterday after it announced
results.

Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy closely
held FoldRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. as it looks to expand into
medicines for rare disorders. 
FoldRx, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is focused on
developing treatments for conditions caused by the improper
folding of proteins, Pfizer said today in a statement. Financial
terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
The deal fits with Pfizer&#8217;s strategy of focusing on
medicines for niche diseases, Geno Germano, head of Pfizer&#8217;s
specialty care unit, said in a telephone interview. Pfizer set
up a research division in June focused on developing medicines
for orphan diseases, classified as conditions affecting less
than 200,000 people. More than 30 million Americans have one of
6,000 orphan diseases, according to the National Organization
for Rare Disorders. 
&#8220;Within our research organization we established a
specific research unit focused on rare disorders and this fits
nicely into that area of focus,&#8221; Germano said today. &#8220;Rare
diseases are an aspect of our portfolio that we think is very
attractive, and we are eager to see and continue development.&#8221; 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, contacted FoldRx
eight weeks ago after one of its researchers saw a scientific
poster presented by the company, Richard Labaudiniere, FoldRx&#8217;s
chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview. He said
the company was founded in 2004 from a technology project
developed at the Scripps Research Institute. 
Lipitor Copies 
Pfizer is looking to make acquisitions to help offset some
of the revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies enter the market of its Lipitor cholesterol pill, the
world&#8217;s top-selling medicine with $11.4 billion in 2009 sales.
Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said in August
that the drugmaker is looking for &#8220;bolt-on transactions&#8221; worth
as much as &#8220;several billion&#8221; dollars. 
Pfizer, based in New York, rose 37 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $16.28 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. 
FoldRx&#8217;s most advanced drug, tafamidis meglumine, is in the
final stages of testing required to get regulatory approval in
the U.S. to treat transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy, a fatal
disorder of the nervous system that affects about 8,000 people
worldwide, Labaudiniere said. The condition starts in most
patients around age 40 and kills them within 10 years, he said.
The company had filed for approval of the treatment in Europe. 
In Development 
FoldRx is also working on drugs in earlier stages of
testing for Parkinson&#8217;s disease, Huntington&#8217;s disease, cystic
fibrosis, and a rare heart condition called transthyretin
amyloid cardiomyopathy. All of its research is focused on
developing chemical compounds, rather than injectable biologics. 
Treatments designated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration as orphan medicines get an additional seven years
of market exclusivity in addition to the standard 20 years of
patent protection, according to the FDA website. 
Pfizer&#8217;s financial adviser on the acquisition was Jefferies
 Co. and its legal adviser was Ropes  Gray LLP. Goldman, Sachs
 Co. served as FoldRx&#8217;s financial adviser, while Mintz, Levin,
Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo P.C., provided legal advice.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-

to an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News. 
Eyles, 40, was the global head of commodity proprietary

JPMorgan has told traders who bet on commodities for the
firm&#8217;s account that their unit will be closed as the company,
starts to shut all proprietary trading, according to a person
briefed on the matter. The bank eventually will close all in-
house trading to comply with new U.S. curbs, said the person. 
&#8220;Oral and Ray will work closely on a transition plan,&#8221;
Blythe Masters, head of the bank&#8217;s global commodities group,
said in the e-mail. &#8220;Ray has a long-term connection in the

Eyles, who joined JPMorgan in 1988, was formerly chief
executive officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa commodities;
co-head of global commodities; and head of global metals and
agriculture, the e-mail said. He was based in Singapore from
1997 to 2000, and again from 2005 to 2007 to start and then
develop JPMorgan&#8217;s Asian commodity business, the e-mail said. 
Dawe, who is Asia-Pacific chief executive officer of the
bank&#8217;s global commodities group, joined JPMorgan in 2008 from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was co-head of Asia
commodities. Under him, the bank &#8220;built a first-class franchise

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s fixed-income
research group was voted No. 1 in Institutional Investor
magazine&#8217;s poll of U.S. money managers, who awarded the firm a
record 55 rankings. 
The magazine surveyed more than 1,100 investors and
analysts at about 440 institutions managing almost $9 trillion
in U.S. fixed-income assets. JPMorgan, which took first place in
26 of the categories, supplanted the former Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. research operations bought by Barclays Capital,
which had reigned for a decade, the  annual poll showed. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve benefited a lot from the global nature of our
franchise and our research team,&#8221; said Terry Belton, Chicago-
based global head of fixed-income strategy at JPMorgan. 
Belton leads the top-ranked team in interest-rate
derivatives and, along with New York-based JPMorgan analyst
Srini Ramaswamy, is joint head of the first-placed general
strategy team, according to the magazine. 
Joyce Chang, global head of the bank&#8217;s credit research
department in New York, and strategist Luis Oganes both got top
billings in emerging-market categories. 
Peter Acciavatti, head of U.S. high-yield and leveraged
loan credit strategy at JPMorgan, polled No. 1 in his category
for the eighth straight year. 
Top TIPS 
Barclays&#8217;s Michael Pond&#8217;s team took top position for
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities for the third year,
while the U.K. bank&#8217;s Peter DeGroot headed the No. 1 group for
municipals strategy, according to Institutional Investor. Peter Hooper at Deutsche Bank AG in New York was voted first for
economics. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. held on to their third and fourth places,
respectively, followed by Wells Fargo Securities, Deutsche Bank,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Nomura Securities International Inc.,
Citigroup Inc. and RBS Securities Inc. 
Institutional Investor produced the numerical score that
determined the overall positions by weighting investors&#8217; votes
based on their U.S. assets under management and the ranking they
gave each team.

Walt Disney Co. kept its ESPN, ABC
and other networks on Time Warner Cable Inc. systems while
negotiations to resolve a fee dispute extended through a
midnight deadline. 
The sides are still talking and programming is still on the
air, Maureen Huff, a spokeswoman for New York-based Time Warner
Cable, said in an e-mail at 6 a.m. local time. 
About 13 million Time Warner Cable subscribers would have
lost ESPN and Disney Channel in a blackout. Customers in New
York, Los Angeles, and Raleigh, North Carolina, would lose ABC
as well. A standoff would threaten Disney&#8217;s advertising revenue,
and potentially trigger defections at Time Warner Cable. 
Sticking points in the negotiations have included whether
Time Warner Cable should pay Disney for its ESPN3.com website
and if it should carry Disney Jr., the preschool service Disney
is converting from SoapNet next year, a person familiar with the
negotiations said last week. 
Burbank, California-based Disney is probably seeking at
least 50 cents per subscriber per month for ABC, and as much as
a 10 percent increase on its cable fees, said Andrew Kim, an
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. 
ESPN Programming 
In addition, Disney requested 10 cents a month per Web
customer for ESPN3.com, said the person with knowledge of the
negotiations, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. ESPN, the most expensive channel on the dial,
received $4.08 per customer monthly on average from pay-TV
operators last year, while the Disney Channel brought in 88
cents a month per subscriber, according to researcher SNL Kagan. 
Time Warner Cable fell 49 cents to $54.47 at 9:41 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 30
percent this year before today. Disney advanced 29 cents to
$33.80 today and had risen 3.9 percent in 2010. 
In January, Time Warner Cable almost lost Fox-owned TV
station programming after a fee battle with parent News Corp.
The dispute was later resolved in overnight talks. In March,
Disney struck a deal with Cablevision Systems Corp. for its ABC
stations after a dispute blacked out the opening minutes of the
Academy Awards for Cablevision&#8217;s 3.1 million New York-area
customers. 
For about two decades, the owners of networks gave away
broadcast rights for their stations, relying on higher
programming fees for their cable networks or better channel
positioning to help drive sales. Disney, like other broadcast
network owners, has been seeking fees for its ABC network, in
addition to asking for higher prices for its cable networks and
introducing new Web fees. 
Time Warner Cable has tried to stem costs by resisting
increased fee demands. In national campaigns, Chief Executive
Officer Glenn Britt has asked subscribers to pressure
programmers to keep costs low. Britt said that higher fees
ultimately are billed to the customer and that network
programming is free on the Internet and over the air.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and HSBC
Holdings Plc are among six banks that may manage a 10 percent
share sale in Steel Authority of India Ltd., according to three
people with knowledge of the matter. 
Deutsche Bank AG, Enam Securities Pvt., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. may also be hired to
manage the sale by the government and the New Delhi-based
company, the people said, declining to be named before a public
announcement. Steel Authority fell 22 percent this year, valuing
a 10 percent stake at almost 78 billion rupees ($1.6 billion). 
The lowest bid for fees was 0.00000000001 percent,
according to two of the people, or less than 1 paisa. The
selected banks must match that to win the mandate, according to
government guidelines. As many as 20 banks compete for each
stake sale, betting that league-table credit will help them win
more investment-banking work in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. 
Selling the stake in Steel Authority would help Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s administration meet its target of
raising 400 billion rupees in the year to March 31. The
government has raised about 20 billion rupees since April 1,
even as Indian companies sold 259 billion rupees in equity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Underwriter Rankings 
Citigroup Inc. is ranked first in managing share sales in
India this fiscal year, followed by IDFC Capital Ltd. and Kotak
Mahindra Capital, the data showed. 
R.K. Singhal, spokesman for Steel Authority, declined to
comment today. Chairman C.S. Verma wasn&#8217;t immediately available.
Spokespeople at the banks didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. 
Steel Authority, the nation&#8217;s second-largest producer of
the alloy, will issue new shares amounting to 5 percent of its
total equity, according to a notice posted in the Economic Times
on Aug. 2. The government, which holds an 85.8 percent stake in
the New Delhi-based company, will sell 5 percent, according to a
statement on the disinvestment department&#8217;s website. 
Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, Edelweiss
Capital Ltd., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., IDBI Capital Ltd. and
IDFC are among 17 banks that bid to manage this offering,
according to the statement. JM Financial Ltd., Morgan Stanley,
Nomura Holdings Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS
AG also submitted bids, it said.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, reached a $5.75 million
settlement resolving a lawsuit against the company over losses
in its 401(k) savings plan. 
The settlement will be paid out of an insurance policy and
will resolve a class-action complaint filed against the company
in Illinois, General Growth said in a court filing today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
The agreement, which requires court approval, is in the
&#8220;best interests&#8221; of General Growth and its creditors because
the Chicago company will get a release of all claims in the
lawsuit without having to pay for the settlement, it said. 
General Growth filed for bankruptcy last year and is set to
seek court approval next month for its restructuring plan.
Before the bankruptcy, it was sued by individuals on behalf of
participants in its 401(k) plan, according to court papers.
Current and former officers, directors and employees were also
sued. The cases were later consolidated. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,

Johnson  Johnson was sued by a
California construction worker over an implanted hip-replacement
device that the drugmaker stopped selling last month after
defect reports surfaced. 
Officials of JJ&#8217;s DePuy Orthopaedics unit knew for years
many of the 93,000 patients with ASR hip implants required
corrective surgeries due to the mechanisms&#8217; defects, lawyers for
Maurice Brigham said in their lawsuit. Brigham, a heavy-
equipment operator, received two implants in 2007, the suit
said. 
&#8220;For more than two years, defendants have known the ASR
Hip Implant Devices were failing early and causing harm in a
high number of patients,&#8221; Brigham&#8217;s attorneys said in the suit,
filed earlier this week in federal court in San Francisco. 
The recall last week came just two days after U.S. Food and
Drug Administration officials warned DePuy about selling two
other hip-replacement systems for unapproved uses. DePuy
generated more than $5.4 billion in sales last year, according
to court filings. 
Bill Price, a Johnson  Johnson spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call for comment on Brigham&#8217;s suit. 
Brigham&#8217;s suit is one of the first of a likely surge of
litigation over the hip products, which JJ pulled off the
market Aug. 26, said Hunter Shkolnik, a New York-based lawyer
who represents patients injured by faulty medical devices. 
&#8220;93,000 is a monstrous recall and I think we&#8217;ll see a
sizeable pile of lawsuits filed to go along with it,&#8221; Shkolnik
said in an interview. Shkolnik said he&#8217;s still investigating
consumers&#8217; claims over the ASR devices and hasn&#8217;t yet filed any
cases. 
&#8216;Revision Surgery&#8217; 
Officials of New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ and
Warsaw, Indiana-based DePuy said they recalled the devices,
known as the ASR XL Acetabular and the ASR Hip Resurfacing
systems, after researchers found many patients needed &#8220;revision
surgery&#8221; after five years because of design defects. 
The resurfacing system substitutes a metal device for the
ball of a human hip while the Acetabular version helps address
pelvic problems. 
Researchers in the U.K. found recently that after five
years, 13 percent of patients with complete hip replacements and
12 percent with resurfacing devices needed a second operation,
known as a revision, JJ officials said in a statement
announcing the recall. 
Other medical-device makers have faced costly product-
liability cases in the past over hip-replacement systems. 
$1 Billion Settlement 
Sulzer AG agreed in 2001 to a $1 billion settlement of
suits alleging hip and knee implants made by its former Sulzer
Medica unit were defective. Sulzer, the world&#8217;s second-largest
maker of pumps, is based in Winterthur, Switzerland. 
The unit, based in Austin, Texas, began recalling hip
implants in January 2001, saying they could loosen. Of the
31,000 patients who received the implants, more than 2,700 have
had them replaced. More than 560 had knee implants replaced. 
In Brigham&#8217;s case against JJ and DePuy, the construction
worker received two Acetabular hip replacements, according to
the suit, filed by Dana Taschner, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who
handles product-liability cases. 
The 52-year-old Brigham, of San Bruno, California, suffered
&#8220;pain, swelling inflammation, infection and damage to
surrounding bone and tissue&#8221; due to defects with the hip-
replacement mechanisms, the suit contends. 
Brigham had one of the devices removed last month, but
hasn&#8217;t been able to get a replacement, the suit said. That&#8217;s
left him unable to walk, the suit added. 
Other Suits 
JJ and DePuy face a similar suits in state court in Los
Angeles and federal court in New Jersey, according to court
filings. 
Vicki Aiken of Roanoke, Virginia, sued DePuy today in
federal court in Newark, New Jersey. By the end of 2008, Aiken
claimed, DePuy had gotten  more than 300 reports of ASR hip
failures and &#8220;fully aware&#8221; that it was defective. 
In the Los Angeles case, Martin Aronson said his body
rejected his Acetabular hip replacement because of a design flaw
that allows metal to grind on metal within the mechanism. 
&#8220;The toxic metal particles that were generated by the
defective hip implant caused Mr. Aronson&#8217;s body to reject the
hip implant and not allow it to grow properly into his bone,&#8221;
Brian Devine, a San Francisco-based lawyer for the Van Nuys,
California resident. The case was filed Aug. 30. 
Devine is Sulzer Medica&#8217;s former assistant general counsel,
according to his web site. 
JJ rose 32 cents to $58.93 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The drugmaker&#8217;s shares have fallen
8.5 percent this year. 
The case is Brigham v. DePuy Orthopaedics Inc. 10-CV-3886,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco).

Pfizer Inc. is pulling out of an
agreement with Celldex Therapeutics Inc. to fund the development
of an experimental brain tumor vaccine. Celldex shares fell the
most in almost two years. 
The vaccine called rindopepimut, or CDX-110, is &#8220;no longer
a strategic priority of Pfizer,&#8221; which will return the rights
to the therapy to Celldex Nov. 1, Needham, Massachusetts-based
Celldex said today in a statement. 
The treatment is in the second of three stages of testing
generally required to win U.S. regulatory approval. New York-
based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, licensed rights to
the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million,
plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. 
&#8220;We see this as a tremendous opportunity for Celldex, our
shareholders and patients,&#8221; said Chief Executive Officer
Anthony Marucci, on a conference call with investors today. &#8220;We
believe rindopepimut is very well-positioned to advance into
pivotal clinical studies.&#8221; 
Celldex fell $1.25, or 26 percent, to $3.53 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Celldex has no approved products,
and the vaccine is its most advanced treatment in testing. 
Funds Needed 
Celldex will need to raise additional money to fund late-
stage testing, Marucci said. The company, with 100 employees,
had $65.8 million in cash and short-term assets as of June 30.
Celldex doesn&#8217;t need another partner to move the drug forward in
development, Marucci said. 
The treatment is designed to ramp up the body&#8217;s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well. 
Pfizer spokesman Curtis Allen declined to comment on the
specifics of why the drugmaker was terminating the agreement
with Celldex. 
&#8220;As part of Pfizer Oncology&#8217;s ongoing prioritization of
assets across its broad research and development portfolio, the
Company will be terminating its license and development
agreement with Celldex Therapeutics for the investigational
compound rindopepimut,&#8221; said Allen in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Pfizer is working to transition the compound back to Celldex
Therapeutics. Pfizer remains committed to research and
development of new therapies for patients with cancer.&#8221; 
Results from a study presented in May showed 70 percent of
patients receiving the vaccine were alive without their cancer
worsening about eight months after diagnosis. Typically, about
half of patients with that type of tumor survive without the
disease progressing during that time period. The finding,
involving 40 patients, were from an interim analysis of a study.

by Koenig  Strey GMAC Real Estate. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to make a bold move to get ahead of the
market,&#8221; said Jim Kinney, vice president of luxury sales for
Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in Chicago. &#8220;This time
next year, that house is not going to be on the market. They&#8217;re
going to find whatever it takes to get it sold.&#8221; 
Dimon and his wife Judith bought the house in 2000 for $4.7
million, according to records on the website of the Cook County
Recorder of Deeds. The mansion, built in the late 1800s, has
eight bedrooms and nine full bathrooms. Dimon first listed it
for sale in April 2007 for $13.5 million. 
The property, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has
a rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. 
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. Janet Owen, the listing agent for the
property, didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment. 
Dimon bought the house, at 25 E. Banks St., when he headed
Chicago-based Bank One Corp. Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale
of Bank One to JPMorgan Chase in 2004. 
The latest price cut was reported earlier today by Business
Insider. 
Sales of single-family homes and condominiums in Chicago
fell 20 percent to 1,589 in July from 1,975 a year earlier, the
Illinois Association of Realtors said Aug. 24. The median price
dropped 20 percent to $196,500 from $245,000.

Morgan Stanley will be replaced by
Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. as the presenting sponsor of the
Memorial Tournament, an annual U.S. PGA Tour event hosted by
Jack Nicklaus, beginning in 2011. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s seven-year sponsorship of the tournament,
which is held at Nicklaus&#8217;s Muirfield Village Golf Club in
Dublin, Ohio, ended after this year&#8217;s event. 
Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
Nationwide&#8217;s agreement with the Memorial extends through
the 2016 tournament, the PGA Tour said in a press release. The
Columbus, Ohio-based insurance company&#8217;s title sponsorship of
the Nationwide Tour, a professional circuit one level below the
PGA Tour, will end after the 2012 season. 
Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest brokerage,
kept a low profile at the tournament the past two years after
members of Congress criticized the spending by financial-
services firms who had received funds as part of the U.S.
government&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
In 2009, the New York-based company replaced the event&#8217;s
annual pro-am competition, in which 54 Morgan Stanley executives
played alongside professionals, with a &#8220;Skins&#8221; competition
involving Tiger Woods, Nicklaus and other pros. 
The departure of Morgan Stanley comes a day after Deutsche
Bank AG extended its sponsorship of this week&#8217;s FedEx Cup
tournament near Boston.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BP Plc and
Vitol Group number among dozens of companies that have met with
the top U.S. commodity regulator in the last six weeks as the
agency moves to implement the sweeping overhaul of the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is drafting 30
sets of rules after enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial bill.
The commission is charged with, among other things, imposing
limits on the number of contracts a single trader can hold,
setting margin requirements and deciding which trades will be
processed, or cleared, through third-party clearinghouses. 
&#8220;This commitment to open government will help promote the
integrity of the rule-writing process,&#8221; said CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler in a statement. 
President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law
on July 21, setting off the first round of lobbying and rule-
writing inside U.S. regulatory agencies. Along with a new
regulatory structure for derivative markets, the law also
creates a new agency to monitor consumer financial products and
a council of regulators to oversee systemic risks. 
The CFTC has met with banks including Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan Chase  Co., airlines such as Delta Air Lines Inc. and
JetBlue Airways, power companies including Exelon Corp. and
NextEra Energy Inc., and oil and natural gas producers including
BP and Hess Corp., according to the CFTC Web site. 
JPMorgan Executive 
Blythe Masters, JPMorgan&#8217;s head of commodities, came in for
a meeting on Aug. 11 to discuss, among other issues, how
regulators would define things like &#8220;major swap participant&#8221;
and &#8220;swap dealer.&#8221; Those definitions will dictate which firms
fall under the regulatory umbrella. 
Jeremy Barnum, a managing director in the bank&#8217;s global
fixed-income group and the chairman of the firm&#8217;s market-
structure group, also attended the meeting with Dan Berkovitz,
the CFTC&#8217;s general counsel, according to the Web site. Barnum,
in June, was tasked by JPMorgan with helping the company adapt
to the new derivatives and clearing rules implemented by
Congress. 
The commission is an independent agency that regulates the
U.S. commodity future and option markets, including markets in
raw materials like wheat, corn, oil and natural gas. 
The CFTC and other regulatory agencies including the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have pledged to post the names
of banks and other lobbyists who come in for meetings on the
implementation of the law. The legislation is named for its
sponsors Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. 
Derivatives are financial instruments based on the value of
another security or benchmark. Some instruments, including
contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have been blamed
for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst recession
since the Great Depression.

focus on currencies, rates and monetary policy. 
Drossos, who joined Morgan Stanley in July 2003, now
reports to Henry McVey, head of global macro and asset
allocation at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. The Aug. 16
move was announced in an internal memo sent today by McVey and
confirmed by Erica Platt, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley. The memo also said Edward Riguardi, who joined
the bank in August 2008, has become a member of the research

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
been trying to improve the performance of its fund unit, the
worst performing of the company&#8217;s three main divisions. Gregory Fleming, the former president and chief operating officer at
Merrill Lynch  Co., joined Morgan Stanley in February as
president of investment management. 
Drossos worked as a senior analyst at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York&#8217;s markets group before joining Morgan Stanley
and previously worked for the U.S. Department of State and the
Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the memo said.

Morgan Stanley cut forecasts for the
dollar against the euro, citing the increasing likelihood of the
Federal Reserve further easing monetary policy. 
The euro will end the year at $1.36 before weakening to
$1.32 in the first quarter of 2011, $1.28 in the second quarter,
$1.26 in the third quarter and $1.24 in the fourth quarter,

forecast a decline to $1.16, then $1.12, $1.12, $1.14 and $1.17
in the following quarters, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8220;We expect that any further easing in U.S. monetary policy
is likely to benefit the euro primarily, as many of the obvious
currencies to own -&#8211; commodity currencies and those with strong
domestic balance sheets -&#8211; are already very expensive,&#8221; Hull
wrote.

China National Offshore Oil Corp.
signed amended production-sharing agreements with Chevron Corp.
and BP Plc after Devon Energy Corp. withdrew from the South
China Sea deepwater oil projects. 
Chevron has agreed to buy a 59.2 percent interest in block
42/05 and full ownership in blocks 64/18 and 53/30 from Devon in
the exploration phase, Cnooc Ltd., China National&#8217;s Hong Kong-
listed unit, said today in a statement. BP acquired Devon&#8217;s
remaining interest in block 42/05, it said. 
&#8220;Chevron and BP are enlarging deepwater cooperation with
Cnooc as the company is poised to maximize deepwater production
at any cost to meet its output goal,&#8221; Wang Aochao, head of
China Energy Research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone
from Shanghai. 
Cnooc, China&#8217;s biggest offshore energy producer, aims to
increase production by as much as 28 percent to 290 million
barrels this year. First-half profit more than doubled as output
rose to a record 149 million barrels of oil equivalent during
the period, driven by the start-up of new fields in Bohai Bay
and the South China Sea, the company said last month. 
Chevron will be the operator of the three blocks, the
Chinese company said. Cnooc Ltd. has the right to secure as much
as 51 percent &#8220;in the event of any commercial discovery in the
blocks,&#8221; it said. 
Chinese Block 42/05 is located in Baiyun Sag of Pearl River
Mouth Basin in the Eastern South China Sea, Cnooc said. Blocks
64/18 and 53/30 are located in Qiong Dong Nan Basin in the
Western South China Sea. Water depth of the three blocks ranges
from 300 to 2,000 meters (6,600 feet). 
BP disclosed the bid for Devon&#8217;s stake in Block 42/05 in
the deepwater South China Sea, on July 27. In March, the London-
based company agreed to buy $7 billion of assets from Devon in
the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and Azerbaijan.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle a U.S. regulator&#8217;s
fraud lawsuit, will pay a separate fine to the U.K.&#8217;s Financial
Services Authority, said a person briefed on the FSA&#8217;s decision. 
The U.K. regulator found that Goldman Sachs failed to
notify it about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
investigation of the New York-based firm&#8217;s Abacus transaction
and of employee Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s role in it, according to the
person, who spoke anonymously because the penalty hasn&#8217;t yet
been made public. 
The fine is less than 20 million pounds ($30.9 million) and
may be announced as soon as today, the person said. FSA
spokeswoman Cerris Tavinor declined to comment, as did Goldman
Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday. The Financial Times reported the
FSA&#8217;s plan yesterday. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, 31, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains a defendant in the case
after the firm settled. He has denied wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packed
into new securities. 
The settlement included a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said. Goldman Sachs, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that marketing materials
for the CDOs had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221; the SEC said. 
The FSA said in April that it would formally investigate
Goldman Sachs related to the SEC&#8217;s claims. 
Lorin Reisner an SEC lawyer, said in August that the
regulator held &#8220;very preliminary&#8221; talks with Tourre about
settling the claims against him.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Quigley unit, a former
asbestos maker, was denied permission to exit bankruptcy by a
judge who found the world&#8217;s largest drug company manipulated the
bankruptcy process to benefit itself. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in New York today
rejected Quigley&#8217;s fourth reorganization plan and said parties
should discuss dismissal of the case. He said the plan was filed
in &#8220;bad faith&#8221; by Pfizer and cited testimony that asbestos
claims directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion over the
next 42 years. 
&#8220;In a nutshell, Pfizer bought enough votes to assure that
any plan would be accepted,&#8221; Bernstein wrote. 
In a 90-page ruling that covers Pfizer&#8217;s failed attempts to
deal with its growing asbestos liabilities since June 1985,
Bernstein noted that a lawyer who represented both Quigley and
Pfizer settled claims against Quigley and got releases for
Pfizer at no additional cost. 
Settling claimants were then given a financial incentive to
vote in favor of Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy plan through a series of
legal moves before and after the bankruptcy filing, the judge
wrote. 
&#8220;We are disappointed in the court&#8217;s ruling as we continue
to believe that Pfizer has no liability for Quigley&#8217;s conduct,&#8221;
a Pfizer spokesman, Chris Loder, said in a telephone interview. 
Bernstein also denied a motion to seal settlements of
asbestos liabilities among Pfizer, Quigley and law firms. 
Right to Know 
&#8220;The public has the right to know how much they were paid
to vote in favor of the Quigley&#8217;s plans,&#8221; the judge wrote. 
Under the proposed Chapter 11 plan, Pfizer would have paid
about $450 million into a trust to satisfy claims about products
for which it allegedly has derivative liability. 
The bankruptcy code would direct all future claims to the
trust, covering death and personal injury claims over Insulag,
Panelag and Damit, Quigley products for the steel industry
containing asbestos that were made from the time of World War II
to the 1970s. 
The plan barred claimants from taking future actions
against Pfizer. Pfizer was a defendant in 280,343 of the 411,100
claims served against Quigley, Bernstein noted. 
&#8220;The Pfizer settlements were part of a strategy, conceived
and executed in bad faith, to manipulate the vote in this
case,&#8221; Bernstein wrote. 
Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products containing
asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s. It was bought by Pfizer in
1968. 
Products With Asbestos 
Pfizer, before it streamlined its business to focus on
pharmaceuticals, also made asbestos-containing products
including Kilnoise, an acoustical plaster, and Firex, an
insulation for armaments in the military. Its liability policies
gave joint coverage to itself and Quigley. 
First named as a defendant in asbestos claims in 1979 or
1980, Quigley was named in 411,100 personal-injury claims and
131,500 civil actions by the time it filed bankruptcy. In
September 1992, Quigley sold all its operating assets to
Specialty Refractories Inc. and didn&#8217;t operate at all until it
entered Chapter 11 protection. 
Quigley&#8217;s only activity has been processing asbestos claims
while in bankruptcy since 2004. Bernstein&#8217;s ruling comes months
after a 15-day trial that pitted the U.S. government and
asbestos victims against Pfizer. 
The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley recommended investors
buy the euro against the yen, saying the European currency will
shrug off concern about sovereign debt. 
&#8220;We think that these concerns are largely discounted and
that the recent weakness of the euro will offset these concerns
with the German export machine benefiting from the weaker

&#8220;As far as the yen is concerned we think the market is
close to a major turn,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;The currency is
likely to be used as a tool to stimulate the economy and further
fiscal measures to boost the economy are also likely to weigh on
the yen.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley estimated the euro may strengthen to 115

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
investors should buy Greek 30-year government bonds as backstops
from the European Union and central bank reduce the risk of
owning the debt. 
&#8220;With the European Central Bank likely to maintain its
longer-term refinancing operations for a while,&#8221; the allure of
this trade will &#8220;remain high,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Vaknin in London wrote today in an e-mailed research note. The

Goldman Sachs made the trade recommendation starting Sept.

Microsoft Corp. said today it will
start selling its Kinect motion-sensing device for the Xbox 360
video-game console in Japan on Nov. 20. 
The accessory will retail from 14,800 yen ($177) with the
&#8220;Kinect Adventures!&#8221; game included, Takashi Sensui, head of
Microsoft&#8217;s game business in Japan, said at a briefing in Tokyo.
Microsoft also will release 10 games for the Kinect in Japan by
early next year, including titles from Sega Sammy Holdings Inc.,
Namco Bandai Holdings Inc. and Konami Corp., Microsoft said in a
statement. 
Microsoft is counting on the Kinect, a box that sits near
the console and tracks a player&#8217;s movements several feet away,
to narrow the gap with Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. in game-
console sales in Japan. The device competes with Sony&#8217;s Move
motion controller for the PlayStation 3, while Nintendo plans to
introduce a 3-D model of the DS portable player and a heart-rate
tracking &#8220;Vitality Sensor&#8221; for the Wii console. 
&#8220;We are offering a completely new experience: Gaming
without a controller,&#8221; Sensui said. 
Outsold by Wii, PS3 
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft plans to introduce the
Kinect in the U.S. in November for $149.99, the company said in
July. It plans to include it in a $299.99 package featuring the
new, slimmer Xbox 360 console and the &#8220;Kinect Adventures!&#8221;
game.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
shopping mall owner planning to exit bankruptcy next month,
plans to keep its top two executives in place while searching
for a new management team. 
Chief Executive Officer Adam Metz and Thomas Nolan, the
president and chief operating officer, have agreed to stay in
their positions for as long as a year after General Growth
completes its restructuring, the Chicago-based company said in a
statement yesterday. 
&#8220;We are pleased to help position the company for the next
chapter in its growth story and ensure a smooth transition for
employees, shareholders and tenants while the board of directors
selects a permanent management team,&#8221; Metz said in the
statement. 
General Growth filed the biggest U.S. real estate
bankruptcy in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. The company&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy is being
financed by a group led by Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
Investors in the restructuring include Fairholme Capital
Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LP. 
Metz and Nolan joined General Growth, the second-largest
U.S. mall owner, in October 2008 following the resignations of
John Bucksbaum from the CEO position and Robert Michaels from
the post of president. 
Metz is a founding partner of closely held Polaris Capital
LLC, former chief investment officer of real estate fund Rodamco
North America NV, and former chief financial officer for real
estate investment trust Urban Shopping Centers Inc. Nolan is a

U.S. power companies may raise their
2010 earnings forecasts on increasing electricity demand, driven
by hot weather and expanding manufacturing, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
said. 
&#8220;Power demand continues to experience a healthy rebound as
industrial demand continues to improve,&#8221; Andrew Smith, an
analyst at JPMorgan in Houston, said today in a report to
clients. 
Smith said top picks to gain from the improving outlook
include Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG Energy Inc., the second-
largest power producer in Texas. CenterPoint Energy Inc., the
Houston area&#8217;s electricity distributor, and CMS Energy Corp.,
Michigan&#8217;s second-largest utility owner, have attractive
dividend yields and trade at low valuations relative to other
regulated utility companies, he said. The analyst has

U.S. power companies will raise 2010 profit forecasts by 3
percent to 5 percent following their third-quarter earnings
reports, Smith said. 
NRG rose 42 cents, or 2 percent, to $21.79 as of the 4 p.m.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s London
unit was fined 17.5 million pounds ($27 million) for failing to
notify the U.K.&#8217;s financial regulator about a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation. 
Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle
the SEC&#8217;s fraud lawsuit over how it marketed a collateralized
debt obligation. The Financial Services Authority fined the New
York-based bank today for failing to report to U.K. regulators
the U.S. investigation that led to the suit, according to an FSA
statement. The firm qualified for the agency&#8217;s standard 30
percent discount for cooperating. 
&#8220;GSI did not set out to hide anything, but its defective
systems and controls meant that the level and quality of its
communications with the FSA fell far below what we expect,&#8221; FSA
enforcement chief Margaret Cole said in the statement. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre in
April over claims the firm misled investors in a collateralized
debt obligation linked to subprime mortgages, known as the
Abacus transaction. The FSA said in April it would investigate
Goldman Sachs International in London after the SEC filed its
lawsuit. Gordon Brown, the prime minister at the time who was
facing a May election, called on the FSA to investigate. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in the April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds
packaged into new securities. 
Still an Employee 
&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased the matter is resolved,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Fiona Laffan said following the FSA announcement.
Tourre &#8220;remains an employee on paid leave,&#8221; she said. 
Beginning in August 2008, the SEC spent a year obtaining
documents and witness evidence about Abacus, including
interviewing London-based employees, the FSA said. In September
2009, the SEC told Goldman Sachs and Tourre, who began working
at the bank&#8217;s London office in November 2008, that it was
planning an enforcement action. The bank&#8217;s compliance department
in London only learned of the SEC investigation when it filed
the lawsuit this year, the FSA said. 
The fine is the second-largest levied by the FSA. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. received the largest FSA penalty in June when its
London unit was fined 33.3 million pounds for not properly
segregating client money from the firm&#8217;s accounts. 
The Goldman Sachs U.S. settlement included a $300 million
fine and $250 million in restitution for investors. The penalty
is the largest ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street
firm, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that
marketing materials for the CDOs had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221;
the SEC said. 
Tourre, 31, remains a defendant in the U.S. case. His FSA
authorization was suspended in April at the bank&#8217;s request. The
SEC allegations related to when he worked in New York.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. may soon let
employees use iPhones for corporate e-mail, making it an
alternative to Research in Motion Ltd.&#8217;s BlackBerry at the bank
for the first time, two people familiar with the situation said. 
JPMorgan is testing the Apple Inc. device and smartphones
based on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software, said the people, who
didn&#8217;t want to be named because the plans haven&#8217;t been made
public. The bank is the second-largest in the U.S. by assets and
has about 220,000 employees worldwide. 
UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, said it is also
considering allowing its staff to use iPhones for company
messaging as more of them opt for the Apple product. UBS has
more than 63,000 employees. 
Apple and Google are making inroads in RIM&#8217;s traditional
stronghold with corporate customers, after their devices first
caught on with consumers. Standard Chartered Bank Plc said in
May it&#8217;s switching from the BlackBerry to the iPhone for
employees and expects to have 15,000 distributed by year-end. 
&#8220;This phenomenon is very new and we expect it to put
increased pressure on RIM&#8217;s performance,&#8221; said Pierre Ferragu,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. &#8220;BlackBerry isn&#8217;t the
only alternative to offer employees mobile e-mail.&#8221; 
RIM fell 90 cents, or 2 percent, to $44.12 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading as the Nasdaq Composite
Index edged up 0.3 percent. The stock has lost 35 percent of its
value this year, while Apple has climbed by a quarter. 
Security Tests 
The tests aren&#8217;t limited to banks. Vanguard Group Inc., the
largest U.S. provider of stock and bond mutual funds, also is
trying out the iPhone with 300 workers and will let employees
companywide use the device soon, said Joshua Grandy, a
spokesman. 
JPMorgan is testing for security in batches of a few
hundred devices with a decision expected later this year, one of
the people familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan wouldn&#8217;t buy
iPhones or Android phones for employees, as it now does with
BlackBerrys. Rather, the bank would allow employees to use the
devices to send and receive corporate e-mail if they make the
purchase themselves, the other person said. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, and
Natalie Harrison, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for RIM, also declined to comment. 
Linking to E-Mail 
UBS doesn&#8217;t plan to replace the BlackBerrys it issues with
iPhones anytime soon, spokesman Jean-Raphael Fontannaz said by
telephone from Zurich. Rather, UBS is testing the possibility of
allowing employees to use an iPhone or another smartphone to
connect to UBS&#8217;s e-mail system without restricting the private
use of the device, he said. 
&#8220;There are certainly quite a few employees that have
private iPhones, and as a bank we have to ask ourselves if that
could be an option for us,&#8221; he said. 
RIM&#8217;s share of the global smartphone market slid to 18.2
percent in the second quarter from 19 percent a year earlier as
customers opted for rivals&#8217; phones with larger screens and more
applications, according to research firm IDC. Apple&#8217;s share rose
to 14.2 percent from 13 percent, while Android surged to 17.2
percent from 1.8 percent. 
Apple said in July that more than 80 percent of the Fortune
100 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone. The
Cupertino, California-based company has taken steps to improve
the iPhone&#8217;s security, such as strengthening encryption tools,
adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with
servers that could wipe out or lock an iPhone if it&#8217;s lost. 
Growing Movement 
More companies are set to follow suit, according to an
August survey done by Sanford Bernstein. 
Of 200 companies polled in the U.S. and U.K., 74 percent
now let their employees use devices other than BlackBerrys, the
research showed. For the U.S. alone, the figure was 83 percent. 
Cost savings and employee preference were the two biggest
factors cited by companies for the shift in the Sanford
Bernstein survey. Employees would rather own an iPhone and are
increasingly willing to buy the device themselves, which helps
cuts costs as companies look to rein in spending, said Sanford
Bernstein&#8217;s Ferragu. 
Other research suggests BlackBerry loyalty may be fading
among the bankers, lawyers and government workers who drove
RIM&#8217;s initial success. About 42 percent of BlackBerry users say
they want to stick with the brand when they buy a new phone,
according to an August survey by Nielsen Co. The rate is 89
percent for iPhone owners and 71 percent for Android devices.

Chevron Corp.&#8217;s trial victory in a
lawsuit brought by Nigerian protesters blaming the company for
violence at an offshore oil platform was upheld on appeal. 
A three-judge panel of the U.S. court of appeals in San
Francisco ruled today that the trial judge made no errors in
admitting challenged evidence or in the jury instructions. The
appellate panel also agreed with the judge that the 1992 U.S.
Torture Victim Protection Act is intended to sue individuals
rather than corporations. 
&#8220;For years, the events that transpired on the Parabe
platform have been misrepresented to courts and the public,&#8221;
Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;While we are sympathetic to the challenges that people of the
Niger Delta face, hostage taking is never the answer.&#8221; 
The case stems from a 1998 incident in which protesters,
who boarded a Chevron oil drilling platform, were attacked by
Nigerian soldiers. Two men were killed, others were shot and
beaten and one man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a
protest about jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area,
according to the 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. 
Nineteen Nigerians sued the company, claiming it was liable
for the actions of the Nigerian soldiers it hired to provide
security for the oil platform. 
After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. 
Theresa Traber, a lawyer representing the Nigerians and
their families, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment. 
The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, 9th U.S.
Court of Appeals (San Francisco).

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
bank by assets, named John Klopp and Olivier de Poulpiquet as
co-chief executive officers and co-chief investment officers of
its real estate investing business. 
Klopp and de Poulpiquet will report to Jay Mantz, who was
named vice chairman of the unit, said Alyson Barnes, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based firm. Owen Thomas, who was
chairman and CEO of the real estate investing group, will remain
chairman and will continue in his primary role of CEO of Morgan
Stanley Asia, Barnes said. 
Morgan Stanley had $43.6 billion of property assets under
management as of June 30, according to its website. The bank is
trying to return the unit to profitability after the firm
recorded about $4.4 billion of real-estate losses in 2008 and
2009 amid the worst commercial property rout in about 20 years. 
Klopp, 56, joined the firm as head of investing in Americas
real estate and global property debt in February, after more
than 20 years at Sam Zell&#8217;s Capital Trust Inc. and its
predecessor. De Poulpiquet, who began his career at Morgan
Stanley in 1994, rejoined the firm in April after leaving for
Pirelli  C. Real Estate SpA in 2003. 
Klopp will be based in New York, while de Poulpiquet will
operate from London, Barnes said. Mantz was previously president
and CIO of the group.

The New York Times reported GM&#8217;s investment in Sakti3
yesterday on its Wheels blog. 
The investment is the second by General Motors Ventures
LLC, the unit formed in June with $100 million in capital for
technology startups. GM Ventures provided $5 million to
Anderson, Indiana-based Bright Automotive in August to help
develop its Idea plug-in commercial van. 
GM plans to sell the Volt in November for a starting price
of $41,000. The Volt can travel 340 miles on a tank of fuel,
with the first 40 in electric drive before a gasoline engine
starts to recharge the battery. 
Sakti3 was founded in 2007 and was spun out of the
University of Michigan, also in Ann Arbor, the company said
today in a statement. 
Itochu Ventures is the corporate venture arm of Itochu
Corp., Japan&#8217;s fourth-largest trading company by market value.

Net capital inflows into emerging
market economies are running at record levels, pushing up asset
prices and raising the risk governments may impose capital
controls, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a research report
today. 
Capital inflows into emerging markets are running at $575
billion a year, more than ever before and 20 percent higher than
before the world financial crisis, according to an e-mailed
report by Robin Brooks, a senior foreign exchange strategist for
Goldman in New York. Low interest rates in the developed world
are leading investors to seek higher returns in faster-growing
emerging economies, he said. 
&#8220;Our baseline case remains of moderate growth in the
advanced economies,&#8221; Brooks said. &#8220;This is contributing to
direct &#8216;a wall of money&#8217; to emerging markets in search of higher
yields.&#8221; 
Capital inflows help emerging economies by providing cheap
financing, lowering bond yields and boosting domestic demand,
Goldman said. They also push currencies to appreciate and create
inflationary pressures which could lead some countries to impose
controls on funds entering from abroad, Brooks said. 
&#8220;Some emerging markets have already resorted to capital
controls, and the risk of further such measures remains,&#8221; he
said. 
Emerging-market sovereign bonds have returned 11.8 percent
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMBI+ index.
Stocks included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index have risen
2.3 percent so far in 2010, compared to a 2.8 percent decline in
the MSCI World Index of 24 developed countries. 
Capital Controls 
In June, South Korea tightened limits on maximum holdings
of currency derivatives by banks in an attempt to reduce the
volatility of capital inflows. The same month, Indonesia&#8217;s
central bank said it would insist investors in its one-month
bills hold the securities for at least four weeks. Brazil
imposed a 2 percent tax on foreign investors&#8217; purchases of
shares and bonds in October last year. 
South Africa&#8217;s ruling African National Congress proposed in
a discussion document July 30 that an inflow tax be considered
to help curb the rand&#8217;s appreciation. The currency has
strengthened more than 30 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of 2009. National Treasury Director-General Lesetja Kganyago said in September the country relies on the foreign
money to finance its current-account deficit, and shouldn&#8217;t
impose a tax on the inflows. 
Goldman recommends investing in the currencies of Asian
countries benefitting from growth in China, he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named Jim O&#8217;Neill, who runs the firm&#8217;s economics, commodities and strategy

O&#8217;Neill, 53, will remain in London and report to Ed Forst
and Tim O&#8217;Neill, global co-heads of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment
management division, the New York-based firm said today in an e-

Management, or GSAM, is subject to U.K. regulatory approval, the
firm said. 
&#8220;Mr. O&#8217;Neill will help lead all aspects of the GSAM
business and serve as an important voice for GSAM in expressing
his views on global investment themes,&#8221; the statement said.
&#8220;He will also continue to write about his views in this newly

O&#8217;Neill, who joined Goldman Sachs as a partner in 1995,

Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the fund unit within the
company&#8217;s investment management division run by Forst and Tim
O&#8217;Neill. In the second quarter, assets under management fell 4.5
percent to $802 billion as clients pulled money out of money
market and equity funds and because of stock market declines.

Morgan Sindall Group Plc rose the
most since December after agreeing to buy most of the ongoing
contracts and related assets of the social housing unit of
Connaught Plc for 28 million pounds ($43.1 million). 
The transaction should generate about 200 million pounds in
extra annual revenue for Lovell Partnerships, Morgan Sindall&#8217;s
affordable housing unit, the company said in a Regulatory News
Service statement today. About 2,500 workers connected with the
contracts will transfer to the company as part of the agreement.
Morgan Sindall climbed as much as 12 percent. 
&#8220;The acquisition significantly increases the scope and
scale of our planned and reactive maintenance activities and
further develops our market-leading position,&#8221; Morgan Sindall
Executive Chairman John Morgan said in the statement. 
This week, Exeter, England-based Connaught appointed
administrators from KPMG after it couldn&#8217;t restructure its
financing and obtain funding. It was suspended from London
trading Sept. 7. On Aug. 6, the company said it expected to
record a full-year &#8220;material loss&#8221; on earnings before
interest, tax and amortization, and it would need to make
&#8220;significant writedowns&#8221; on assets. 
Morgan Sindall rose as much as 79 pence to 740.5 pence and
traded at that price as of 9:06 a.m. The stock has gained 23
percent this year, giving the London-based company a market
value of 319.7 million pounds.

Exxon Mobil Corp. shut the larger

Trecate, Italy, after the second fire in almost two weeks. 
The blaze, which occurred as the unit was being restarted
following a fire on Aug. 31, began at about 8:45 a.m. local time
yesterday and was extinguished 45 minutes later, Antonella
Sopranzetti, a Rome-based spokeswoman for the company, said
today by phone. There were no injuries and an investigation into
the cause of the fire is being carried out, she said. 
Fuel-producing units at the plant are at reduced rates
because of the lower-than-usual feed, Sopranzetti said. The
refinery can meet all its sales contracts &#8220;at this stage&#8221; as a
contingency plan is being arranged for fuel deliveries, she
said. 
The plant near Milan has the capacity to process 230,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon is operator of the site with a 74.1
percent stake, while Italy&#8217;s ERG SpA holds the rest.

Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ESPN sports
network entered into a programming agreement with a new cable
network geared toward historically black colleges and
universities, according to the executive starting the network. 
The HBCU Network plans to begin carrying live sporting
events from predominantly black colleges in August 2011, said
Curtis Symonds, chief executive of the venture. 
In addition to sports, the HBCU Network will broadcast
entertainment, culture and lifestyle programming, Symonds said.
The network will be &#8220;somewhat modeled&#8221; after News Corp.&#8217;s Big
Ten Network, he said. 
The partnership is likely to be announced later this week,
Symonds said. Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman at ESPN, couldn&#8217;t
immediately be reached for comment. 
Symonds, the former head of affiliate sales and marketing
at Viacom Inc.&#8217;s BET cable network, said distribution agreements
are being negotiated with at least two cable companies, which he
declined to name. He said he expects the HBCU network to be
available in about 10 million homes when it starts. 
ESPN owns the rights to games from the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference, the Southwestern Athletic Conference, the Southern
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and the Central
Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which include the majority
of the country&#8217;s 105 historically black colleges and
universities. Those programming rights, Symonds said, will be
shared with the HBCU Network. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice piece of programming for us,&#8221; Symonds said.
&#8220;You want to partner with folks like ESPN.&#8221; 
The universities themselves will own 20 percent of the
equity in the network, Symonds said. It has not been determined
how those ownership stakes will be divided among the colleges,
he said.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s

&#8220;We unequivocally abhor any attempt to leverage

independent international law firm to conduct an investigation

Microsoft will take more steps to ensure that NGOs and
other groups that act as public advocates aren&#8217;t mistreated amid
anti-piracy efforts, Smith said. On Sept. 11, the New York Times
reported that Russian security services monitored &#8220;outspoken
advocacy groups&#8221; and seized their computers, claiming the groups
were using pirated Microsoft software. 
Microsoft plans a new license for the organizations to make
sure they have free, legal Microsoft software and will create an
legal aid program in Russia to help them document that they have
legitimate software, Smith said. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s clear we have a responsibility to take new steps to

Exxon Mobil Corp. halted jet fuel
production at its Sarpom refinery in Trecate, Italy, following
the second fire in less than two weeks in the larger of the
site&#8217;s two crude distillation units. 
The facility, which supplies fuel to Milan&#8217;s Malpensa
airport, has a week of aviation fuel stored, Rosario Lentini, a
spokesman for the refinery, said today by phone. Eni SpA also
transports the oil-product via pipeline to the airport, he said. 
The crude unit, which was being started following an Aug.
31 fire, was forced to shut after a blaze at 8:45 a.m. local
time on Sept. 11. Even as the site&#8217;s smaller unit is operating,
output of fuels such as gasoline has dropped because of the
lower-than-usual feed, the company said yesterday. 
The refinery can process 230,000 barrels of oil a day and
is running at 30 percent to 40 percent of capacity, according to
Lentini. He couldn&#8217;t give a time for the restart of the crude
unit as Italian prosecutors are investigating, he said. 
There won&#8217;t be any shortage of jet fuel to Malpensa,
according to an official at Sea SpA, which manages both of

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-

&#8220;We are working on a technical issue,&#8221; Tom Kelly, a

site has been down &#8220;since overnight," said Kelly, who couldn&#8217;t

JPMorgan&#8217;s active online customers have grown by an average
annual rate of 42 percent since 2006, according to a

"I know our system is down today," Dimon said at the

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, is moving some credit-default and commodities
swaps businesses to a subsidiary to comply with new U.S.
financial rules. 
JPMorgan is moving &#8220;certain investment-grade CDS and some
of the commodities to a separate subsidiary,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said today in New York at a conference
sponsored by Barclays Capital. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a real pain. It&#8217;s an operational nightmare,&#8221; Dimon
said. &#8220;In my opinion, it&#8217;s highly ill conceived, doesn&#8217;t reduce
risk at all. As a matter of fact, it probably complicates it for
some people.&#8221; 
Dimon estimated the new rules, which President Barack Obama
signed into law July 21, will cost the bank roughly $1 billion
in lost revenue but won&#8217;t affect profit &#8220;that much.&#8221; The
legislation requires banks to move their derivatives trading
operations into separately capitalized subsidiaries and moves
much of the market to regulated exchanges and clearinghouses. 
&#8220;Some of these things will create more volume, more
opportunity as long as we build the systems,&#8221; Dimon said.
&#8220;This really is an issue more for clients than for us. The
capital impact for dealers is unclear but largely positive.&#8221; He
said that moving a lot of activity to a clearinghouse reduces
capital requirements for broker-dealers, while requiring clients
to set aside more collateral. 
Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived
from stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and physical commodities
like oil and wheat.

After buying 120 to 200 copies, the crowd at the Herald
Square GameStop subsided, Sean Rappaport, assistant manager at
the location, said in a telephone interview. At 9 a.m. there
were fewer shoppers and more than 600 games still available. 
&#8220;Who knows, by rush hour at 5 or 6 o&#8217;clock, we may or may
not run out,&#8221; Mayari Reyes, another employee at the store, said

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 19 cents to
$25.30 at 12:28 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market

Hardware Sales 
The game will boost sales for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360 console
months before the company&#8217;s introduction of a motion-sensing
peripheral for casual gamers called Kinect, said Anita Frazier,
an analyst for product-tracking researcher NPD Group Inc.
Microsoft is selling a limited edition version of its Xbox 360
console with &#8220;Halo: Reach&#8221; for $399. 
&#8220;If hardware sales react in a similar fashion to what was
experienced when Halo 3 was launched in September 2007,
September could be a huge sales month for Xbox 360 hardware,&#8221;
Frazier said in a Sept. 10 statement, before the game&#8217;s release. 
Halo, Kinect and Sony Corp.&#8217;s planned Move motion-control
peripheral for the PlayStation 3 may help the video-game
industry in what has been a sluggish year. U.S. software sales
in the first nine months of the year have dropped almost 10
percent from the same period a year earlier, NPD reported Sept.
9.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
are missing out on Chinese initial public offerings as local
investment banks lead record numbers of small companies to sell
shares in Shenzhen. 
China accounts for a third of the $150 billion raised
worldwide in IPOs this year -- yet the average deal size has
shrunk as companies rush to list on Shenzhen&#8217;s ChiNext startup
board introduced in October. Goldman Sachs, ranked first in
overseas IPOs by Chinese companies, has expanded its local
investment-banking unit&#8217;s workforce by about 40 percent in 2010
as it moves to target smaller domestic offerings. 
&#8220;We are going to put more focus on ChiNext IPO deals,&#8221;
Thomas Deng, head of China equity capital markets at New York-
based Goldman Sachs, said in a Sept. 8 interview. &#8220;Our pipeline
has traditionally been mostly big deals, or at least that&#8217;s the
perception. This may change.&#8221; 
Companies have raised 358 billion yuan ($53 billion) in
first-time sales in Shanghai and Shenzhen since Jan. 1, putting
this year on track to overtake 2007 as the biggest for local
IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs
hasn&#8217;t worked on any such deals. UBS, in 18th place overall,
ranks first among foreign investment banks in underwriting yuan-
denominated IPOs after advising on one offering in 2010.

Emerging markets labeled as the
&#8220;Next 11&#8221; by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are on a roll as the
category&#8217;s creator moves to a new job within the firm. 
As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a stock index for the so-
called N-11 has risen more than MSCI&#8217;s benchmarks for emerging
markets and for the so-called BRIC countries: Brazil, Russia,
India and China. The 11-country gauge is compiled by Solactive,
part of Structured Solutions AG, and consists of 40 stocks. 
Goldman&#8217;s Jim O&#8217;Neill first wrote about the N-11 in
December 2005, four years after introducing the BRICs. The group
is composed of &#8220;countries than might have BRICs-like
potential,&#8221; he said in a report. 
O&#8217;Neill headed Goldman&#8217;s global economics research at the
time. He was running that team, along with the firm&#8217;s strategy
and commodity research coverage, when he was named chairman of
its asset-management unit last week. 
The N-11 countries are Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey
and Vietnam. 
Share prices are higher this year in every country except
Vietnam, where the VN-Index has dropped 9.2 percent. The best
performers among local benchmarks include Bangladesh&#8217;s Dhaka
Stock Exchange General Index, up 50 percent, and Indonesia&#8217;s
Jakarta Composite Index, up 28 percent.

International Business Machines
Corp. is joining five companies, including Citigroup Inc. and ATT
Inc., to create a website that streamlines applications by small
businesses seeking to become suppliers to the group. 
The site will offer one electronic form to be filled out by
potential suppliers to contact all six companies, Armonk, New
York-based IBM and the other five said today in a joint
statement. Participants in the program also include Bank of
America Corp., Pfizer Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. 
Small businesses often increase sales and employees when
they begin supplying large corporations, which could boost the
economy, Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban
Future, said in the statement. Convoluted application processes
can inhibit small suppliers, which don&#8217;t have a lot of resources
or manpower, said Alison Bates Fisher, an event designer at Main
Events Catering. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the time,&#8221; said Fisher, who helps her
Arlington, Virginia-based company host marketing events and
executive board meetings for corporations such as PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. &#8220;Having an easier way to get to these large
clients saves me time, which gives me more time to get other
business.&#8221; 
The six corporate members of the site award about $150
billion in contracts for supplies annually, IBM said. As the
program grows, more corporations are expected to join. 
The site, called Supplier Connection, is scheduled to start
in the first quarter of next year. IBM will create and maintain
the site with a grant of more than $10 million from its
foundation.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by three former female employees who claim they faced
discrimination in pay and fewer opportunities for promotion than
men at the firm. 
&#8220;The violations of its female employees&#8217; rights are
systemic, are based upon companywide policies and practices, and
are the result of unchecked gender bias that pervades Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s corporate culture,&#8221; the women said today in a complaint
in federal court in Manhattan. 
The plaintiffs, H. Cristina Chen-Oster, 39, a former vice
president; Lisa Parisi, 48, a former managing director; and
Shanna Orlich, 30, a former associate, seek class-action status
to represent all female Goldman Sachs employees with those job
titles. 
The women seek unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Goldman Sachs to remedy the &#8220;systemic sex
discrimination&#8221; at the firm, according to the complaint. 
&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit,&#8221; said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman. &#8220;People are critical to our
business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop
and retain outstanding women professionals.&#8221; 
Chen-Oster is currently a managing director in sales at
Deutsche Bank AG in New York, where she&#8217;s worked since 2006. A
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
Fewer Women 
According to the complaint, the proportion of women among
Goldman Sachs managers decreases as their job level increases.
The women claim that, according to figures published by Goldman
Sachs in 2009, women constituted 29 percent of vice presidents
and 17 percent of managing directors. 
According to 2008 figures, women represented 14 percent of
partners, the plaintiffs claimed. Four members of the 30-person
management committee are women, and just one of nine executive
officers, according to the complaint. 
While Goldman Sachs ceased to be a partnership when the
firm became a public company in 1999, it has retained the term
&#8220;partner&#8221; to denote the prestige of its highest-ranking
managing directors. Partners also receive part of a pool of
compensation that&#8217;s specially designated for them, frequently in
the form of restricted stock awards. 
The plaintiffs claim that Goldman Sachs gives its managers,
most of whom are men, &#8220;unchecked discretion&#8221; over assigning
responsibilities to their subordinates. 
Biased System 
The complaint also says that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s system for
evaluating employee performance is biased against women. 
&#8220;Men at Goldman Sachs are viewed more favorably, receive
more compensation, and are more likely to be promoted,&#8221; the ex-
Goldman Sachs employees claimed. 
The former employees are seeking to represent an
unspecified number of female associates, vice presidents and
managing directors who worked for Goldman Sachs at any time from
Sept. 10, 2004, through the resolution of their federal
discrimination claims and from July 7, 2002, for claims under
New York state law. 
Chen-Oster claimed she told her supervisor in 1999 about an
incident that took place in 1997 at a firm-sponsored dinner for
a male employee who had been promoted to managing director.
After the outing, which included a stop at a Manhattan topless
bar, a male colleague pinned Chen-Oster against a wall outside
her apartment, kissing and groping her. 
Chen-Oster claimed that, after reporting the incident, she
was subjected to increased hostility and found herself
marginalized at the firm. 
Golf Outing 
&#8220;While Chen-Oster&#8217;s career growth stagnated, the male
colleague involved in the 1997 incident was promoted to managing
director and finally partner,&#8221; according to the complaint.
&#8220;Over the same period, he saw his compensation increase by more
than 400 percent.&#8221; 
Orlich claimed she was treated differently from male
employees and denied the opportunity to work as a trader. She
claims she and other women were shut out of work-related social
events. 
Orlich said she learned of a golf outing attended by 80
Goldman Sachs employees, only one of whom was a woman. Orlich,
who said she has played golf since childhood and competed on her
high school varsity golf team, wasn&#8217;t invited while several less
senior male analysts attended. 
Orlich also claimed she was assigned clerical and
administrative work that male associates didn&#8217;t have to do. A
senior male analyst &#8220;often gave her demeaning and menial
assignments, such as setting up his blackberry, making
photocopies, and answering calls from his wife,&#8221; according to
the complaint. 
Chen-Oster filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and received a notice of right to sue.
The other two plaintiffs have also asked for right-to-sue
notices from the EEOC, according to the complaint. 
Other Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage unit, have settled sex-
discrimination lawsuits in recent years. 
In 2004 Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to settle
a suit brought by former bond saleswoman, Allison Schieffelin,
and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Schieffelin was represented by Outten  Golden LLP, one of the
firms representing the plaintiff in the case against Goldman
Sachs. 
Goldman Sachs in March was sued for bias by a former vice
president who said she was pushed onto the &#8220;mommy-track&#8221; and
eventually fired after she chose to work part-time following her
pregnancy. That lawsuit, which alleged violations of the U.S.
Family Medical Leave Act, gender and pregnancy discrimination,
was filed in Manhattan federal court and is pending. 
The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-6950,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp. released a new
version of its Internet Explorer Web browser today, aiming to
stem market-share losses to Firefox, Google Inc.&#8217;s Chrome and
Apple Inc.&#8217;s Safari. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, marked the public
release of a test version of Internet Explorer 9 at an event in
San Francisco. The software offers support for HTML 5 technology
and loads pages faster. 
Internet Explorer&#8217;s share of the browser market has fallen
to 60 percent from 74 percent about two years earlier, as
Firefox, Chrome and Safari gain ground, according to Net
Applications. With Chrome usage up sevenfold, Microsoft needs to
ensure that users keep their focus on the Windows operating
system, rather than run programs through Google&#8217;s browser, said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a research
firm in Kirkland, Washington. 
&#8220;Based on developer buzz, it seems tech enthusiasts are
more excited about IE 9 than any version of IE in recent times,&#8221;
Rosoff said. &#8220;We might start to see IE regain some market share
from Firefox,&#8221; whose growth has slowed, he said. &#8220;Chrome still
seems to be the one people are most interested in, in terms of
the cutting edge.&#8221; 
Market share for Firefox, made by Mozilla Corp., rose to 23
percent last month from 19 percent about two years earlier,
according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet usage
statistics. Chrome jumped to 7.5 percent from 1.1 percent, and
Safari climbed to 5.2 percent from 2.8 percent. 
New Features 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, had as much
as 97 percent of the Internet-browser market as recently as
2003. 
Internet Explorer&#8217;s HTML 5 support delivers high-quality
video playback faster and lets users do things like open a
virtual book and flip through its pages. The set of technologies
may eventually replace Adobe Systems Inc.&#8217;s Flash and
Microsoft&#8217;s competing Silverlight, Rosoff said. 
At the event, the company showed how its Bing search engine
can take advantage of the new browser to put video images on the
home page and let users zoom in to images on the home page. 
The new browser also is faster at loading and running
applications written in JavaScript, an area where IE 8 was far
slower than Chrome, Rosoff said. 
Microsoft rose 9 cents to $25.12 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have dropped 18 percent
this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., whose website
failed today for the second time this week, will refund late
fees and help fix other problems for the 16.6 million online
customers unable to access their accounts. 
&#8220;We will work with customers on any issues that occurred,
including late fees,&#8221; Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank, said in an e-mail. The site went down late Sept. 13
and service was restored around 1 a.m. New York time today. The
system failed again several hours later and was back online by
this afternoon. 
The problem was a software glitch and customers&#8217; accounts
weren&#8217;t at risk, Christine Holevas, a company spokeswoman, said
in an interview. 
The bank&#8217;s primary regulator in Washington was on alert
after the service initially failed. 
&#8220;We monitored this situation very closely,&#8221; said Bob Garsson, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, declining to elaborate. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s active online customers have increased by an
average annual rate of 42 percent since 2006, according to a
presentation to investors by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
yesterday. More than 3.7 million households use JPMorgan&#8217;s
website to pay their bills. 
Visit a Branch 
&#8220;Online customers should contact Chase telephone banking
at 800-935-9935 or visit a branch to correct late fees that were
incurred during the outage,&#8221; Holevas said in an e-mail.
JPMorgan will also refund late fees charged by other
institutions, she said. 
The length of the outage raises operational risk and
internal control issues for the bank, which was the only major
Wall Street firm to make it through the financial crisis without
posting quarterly losses, said Christopher Whalen, a former
analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and co-founder
of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. 
&#8220;These systems are big and complex, but they should have
redundancy to take the &#8216;A&#8217; system offline if need be for hours
at least,&#8221; Whalen said. 
Dimon apologized for the inconvenience during his
presentation at Barclays Capital yesterday, saying, &#8220;I know our
system is down today. I apologize for that.&#8221;

Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to shut a

maintenance early next year, two people with knowledge of the
work said. 
The halt is scheduled to start in the first quarter and
last about four weeks, the people said, declining to be
identified because the information is confidential. A
powerformer, which makes blending components for gasoline, will
also be idled for repairs during the same time, they said. 
Emma Heywood, a U.K.-based spokeswoman for Exxon, declined
to comment. Fawley has three crude units, a local environmental
officer said yesterday by phone. 
The refinery can process about 320,000 barrels of oil a day
and supplies 15 percent of Britain&#8217;s petroleum products,
according to the country&#8217;s Petroleum Industry Association.
Refiners regularly halt equipment for inspections and repairs to
prevent problems and ensure efficient operations.

Alert the antitrust police.
Microsoft Corp. is back to doing what it was accused of years
ago: taking advantage of its dominant position in personal
computers to benefit its Web browser. It&#8217;s blatant. And it&#8217;s
terrific. 
Internet Explorer 9, available in beta, or test, form this
week, is the best browser Microsoft has ever produced. If that
isn&#8217;t saying much, this says more: It may turn out to be the
best browser for Windows computers that anyone has produced. 
And that&#8217;s saying quite a lot, given the proliferation of
top-notch browsers that have eaten into Explorer&#8217;s dominance in
recent years: Mozilla Corp.&#8217;s Firefox, Google Inc.&#8217;s Chrome, and
even the Windows version of Apple Inc.&#8217;s Safari. Indeed, it&#8217;s a
mark of how much the digital world has changed that nary a
regulator&#8217;s eyebrow was raised by aspects of the new Internet
Explorer that might have set off alarm bells a decade ago. 
IE9 isn&#8217;t for everyone; in fact, it isn&#8217;t even for every
Windows user. The browser, which is available as a free
download, doesn&#8217;t work with Windows XP, the 9-year-old operating
system that remains the most widely used version; it is
compatible only with the more recent Vista and Windows 7
flavors. 
Particularly with Windows 7, the new browser blurs the
distinction between Web content and applications that run on
your PC. You can now pin website icons to the Windows task bar,
where they look and act just like the programs installed on your
local hard drive, even down to the right-mouse-click that opens
a menu of things you can do on the site. 
Topping Rivals 
The new software also goes well beyond its competitors in
taking advantage of the hardware inside your computer. By and
large, most browsers tap very little of a machine&#8217;s raw
computing power, such as the potent graphics chips found in
modern PCs. Developers writing software to run on many different
operating systems aren&#8217;t that interested in optimizing it for
just one platform. 
Microsoft, though, has no such qualms. It junked the Mac
version of Explorer years ago, and with IE9 it takes full
advantage of its Windows-only focus by using the PC&#8217;s hardware
to provide a speed boost. 
Now a lot of other factors besides the browser affect how
fast the Web feels to you. First and foremost is the quality of
your Internet connection itself. The design of the site you&#8217;re
visiting has an impact as well. 
Noticeably Faster 
Still, the browser is an important piece of the experience,
and IE9 is demonstrably faster than its predecessor. The
difference is most noticeable on websites that are heavy on
graphics or animation. With this browser, Microsoft is also
embracing HTML5, the same online-graphics standard that Apple&#8217;s
Steve Jobs has been touting as a faster, better alternative to
Adobe Systems Inc.&#8217;s Flash software. 
Microsoft even extends its quest for speed to the length of
time it takes to launch Explorer. If you have a third-party
toolbar installed -- say, the one from Microsoft&#8217;s arch-nemesis
Google -- IE9 will tell you just how much it&#8217;s adding to your
start-up time, and encourage you to disable it. If you still
want to conduct searches directly from the browser, don&#8217;t fear:
Explorer now lets you type a search term right into the address
bar, a feature Chrome has had for some time. 
Visually, the new browser is almost minimalist. Microsoft
has cut down considerably on the number of buttons and menus
visible by default. Messages and dialogue boxes that used to
appear in the middle of the browser window, disrupting content,
have moved to a less obtrusive bottom-of-the-screen location. 
Safety Screen 
IE9 also has a new download manager that shows your
progress in pulling content from the Internet and keeps track of
where on your hard drive the saved files are located, while a
new safety screen warns you of potential hazards and blocks
risky activity. 
The net effect -- no pun intended -- of all Microsoft&#8217;s
changes is a browser that is thoroughly clean, fast and modern,
attributes that haven&#8217;t always been attached to Internet
Explorer. If the new software can also avoid the security lapses
that plagued some previous releases, Microsoft will be able to
claim that its No. 1 market share on PCs isn&#8217;t just because of
who makes it, but of how good it is.

Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack
and Chief Executive Officer James Gorman sought to defeat a
shareholder lawsuit over allegedly &#8220;unconscionable&#8221;
compensation paid to employees. 
A lawyer for Mack, Gorman and Morgan Stanley executives
named in the lawsuit asked New York State Supreme Court Justice
Shirley Werner Kornreich to dismiss the complaint at a court
hearing today in Manhattan. Morgan Stanley directors also sought
to throw out the lawsuit. 
&#8220;In times of crisis you want the most talented people to
stay. You pay them to stay,&#8221; said Evan Chesler, who represents
Mack, Gorman and the executives. The court, he added, can&#8217;t
second-guess company decisions over pay for its 60,000
employees. 
A group of Morgan Stanley shareholders sued Morgan Stanley
executives and directors earlier this year over $45 billion in
employee compensation in 2006, 2007 and 2009. In the complaint,
it calls the pay &#8220;unconscionable&#8221; and &#8220;staggering&#8221; given the
company&#8217;s performance, including relying on government bailout
money in 2009. 
Jay Eisenhofer, an attorney for the shareholders, told
Kornreich at the hearing that there was &#8220;no relationship&#8221;
between pay and profitability at Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;This was done without regard to profitability of the
company,&#8221; he said. 
Suffered Harm 
The shareholders who filed the lawsuit are the Security
Police and Fire Professionals of America Retirement Fund, the
Central Laborers&#8217; Pension Fund, and Arthur Murphy Jr. on behalf
of the Jean E. Murphy Revocable Trust. 
The complaint alleges shareholders suffered harm from the
conduct of the executives and directors. The stockholders &#8220;seek
to recover billions in compensation,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.
In an interview after the hearing, Eisenhofer declined to
specify the amount. 
The case is Security Police and Fire Professional of
America Retirement Fund v. John J. Mack, 600359-2010, New York
State Supreme Court (Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp., trying to regain
lost share in the mobile-phone market, said its Windows Phone 7
devices will be able to play YouTube clips and Netflix movies. 
The phones will feature Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube even though
they don&#8217;t support Adobe Systems Inc. Flash technology, Brandon Watson, a director for Windows Phone 7, said at an event
yesterday at Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond, Washington, headquarters.
Watson also demonstrated applications from Netflix Inc.,
OpenTable Inc., Travelocity.com Inc. and Flixster Inc. 
Microsoft revamped its mobile software amid share losses to
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and handsets with Google&#8217;s Android operating
system. Microsoft said in July it has provided financial
incentives including funds for software development and
marketing to attract app developers to help the company create
more compelling programs for its operating system. 
The company&#8217;s share in the global mobile-phone market fell
to 5 percent in the second quarter, from 9.3 percent a year
earlier, according to market research firm Gartner Inc. Android
climbed to 17 percent from 1.8 percent while the iPhone rose to
14 percent from 13. 
Microsoft will release today the final version of a free
toolkit for application developers. The package includes copies
of Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio tools for mobile and a design
program called Expression Blend.

General Motors Co., 61 percent
owned by the U.S. Treasury, will be &#8220;patient&#8221; with efforts to
turn around its unprofitable European unit, Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson said today. 
The automaker doesn&#8217;t need to find a partner for the Opel
business at this time, Akerson, 61, told reporters at GM&#8217;s
Renaissance Center headquarters in Detroit. Europe is GM&#8217;s only
unprofitable region, with losses totaling $637 million before
interest and taxes in the first half. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re willing to be patient and invest,&#8221; Akerson said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m confident that we&#8217;ll see progress over the longer term.&#8221; 
Akerson became CEO this month after Ed Whitacre, 68,
stepped down to give GM a longer-term executive as it sells
investors on the company&#8217;s initial public offering. The company
is seeking to raise as much as $16 billion in the IPO, a person
familiar with the plans said in August. The offering will reduce
the stake the U.S. government acquired in GM&#8217;s $50 billion
taxpayer bailout last year. 
&#8220;It is a goal of this company to return that money to the
taxpayers of America,&#8221; Akerson said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s
going to be in one fell swoop. I think that&#8217;s unrealistic. We
have to post numbers and provide some consistent results, and
over the next couple years that will happen.&#8221;

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
proprietary traders who created a hedge fund within the firm in
2007 have generated a return of about 3 percent this year,
beating the industry average, people briefed on the gain said. 
Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, composed of former
employees of the principal-strategies team led by Raanan Agus
and Kenneth Eberts, manages more than $7 billion. The fund
gained about 26 percent last year, net of fees, after losing 
more than 18 percent in 2008, the people said. Andrea Raphael, 
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to 
comment. 
GSIP&#8217;s performance may help other members of the
proprietary trading group, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies,
as they pursue work outside the firm. Pierre Henri Flamand, who
succeeded Agus in running principal-strategies, left in March
and is starting a hedge fund called Edoma Capital Partners LLP.
The team he left behind is being disbanded to comply with U.S.
rules aimed at curbing risk, two people with knowledge of the
decision said earlier this month. 
Morgan Sze, the Hong Kong-based partner who took charge of
principal-strategies after Flamand left, is considering raising
money for a new hedge fund focused on Asia, according to people
familiar with the matter. Perella Weinberg Partners LP and KKR 
Co. are among the firms that are in talks to hire members of the
U.S. principal-strategies group led by Bob Howard, two people
briefed on the negotiations said last week. 
Dodd-Frank Act 
The hedge fund industry posted an average return of 1.45
percent this year through August, 20 percent last year and lost
a record 19 percent in 2008, according to Chicago-based research
firm Hedge Fund Research Inc. 
Goldman Sachs Investment Partners started with about $7
billion, the biggest start-up in the hedge fund industry, and
had climbed to $7.5 billion as of October 2009. The company&#8217;s
investment in the fund accounted for about 35 percent of assets
as of October, according to fund marketing documents obtained by
Bloomberg News. 
The fund&#8217;s investments include stocks, credit, distressed
securities as well as hard-to-sell assets, the documents show. 
Agus, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 in the equities
arbitrage group, co-ran the principal-strategies group and
became head of the group until 2007. Eberts, 43, had worked on
the equity derivatives desk from 1992 to 1998, when he moved to
the principal strategies group. 
Goldman Sachs, which says about 10 percent of its revenue
comes from proprietary trading, is grappling with a provision of
the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act that prohibits banks from
risking capital by betting for their own accounts. 
Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies is housed within the
firm&#8217;s equities division and traces its roots to the risk
arbitrage team once led by Robert Rubin, 72, who later became
U.S. Treasury secretary. Alumni of the division who have left to
start their own hedge funds include Frank Brosens at Taconic
Capital Advisors LLC and Thomas Steyer at Farallon Capital
Management.

Chevron Corp. said it aims to
supply China&#8217;s largest oil company with liquefied natural gas
from its proposed Wheatstone project in Australia, the nation at
the center of the U.S. energy producer&#8217;s growth plans. 
Chevron and China National Petroleum Corp. may collaborate
on the development of gas fields in the Carnarvon Basin off
northwest Australia and on exploration in China as part of a
preliminary accord signed in Beijing, Gareth Johnstone, a
spokesman for Chevron in Singapore, said in an e-mail today. 
Wheatstone is among A$200 billion ($187 billion) of
proposed LNG ventures in Australia targeting Asian demand for
cleaner-burning alternatives to coal, according to figures this
month from the Australian Petroleum Production  Exploration
Association. The biggest of the projects is Chevron&#8217;s A$43
billion Gorgon development on Australia&#8217;s Barrow Island. 
&#8220;Our Australian investments will transform Chevron into
one of the world&#8217;s leading LNG producers,&#8221; Jim Blackwell,
president of Chevron&#8217;s Asia-Pacific exploration and production,
said at a conference in New York yesterday. Blackwell called
Australia &#8220;the centerpiece of the growth story for Chevron.&#8221; 
Wheatstone may have as many as six processing units,
producing as much as 25 million metric tons of the fuel a year,
Chevron said in July. The second-biggest U.S. energy company
aims to approve Wheatstone in the middle of 2011, after gaining
environmental approval, a development timeline shows. 
&#8216;Considerable Expertise&#8217; 
Chevron continues to talk with &#8220;third-party&#8221; suppliers
that would provide gas to support an expansion of Wheatstone,
Blackwell said, according to a transcript on Chevron&#8217;s website. 
Apache Corp. and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co.
have agreed to feed gas to the first two Wheatstone processing
units. In exchange, Houston-based Apache will receive a stake of
about 16.3 percent in the project and Kuwait&#8217;s state-owned oil
company will take about 8.8 percent, Chevron said last year. 
The Chevron and CNPC memorandum of understanding &#8220;allows
each company to leverage the other&#8217;s considerable technology,
operational expertise and processes to explore, appraise and
develop strategic upstream projects around the world,&#8221;
Johnstone said. The agreement offers CNPC an &#8220;offtake
opportunity from the expanded project,&#8221; according to his e-mail. 
Liu Weijiang, a Beijing-based spokesman for CNPC, the
state-owned parent of PetroChina Co., didn&#8217;t answer calls made
to his office and mobile phone. 
Strengthen Relationship 
Asian customers typically seek to acquire stakes in
Australian LNG projects, Benjamin Wilson, an analyst with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Sydney, said by phone today. Chevron
didn&#8217;t provide any details about how much fuel it may provide to
CNPC or how big a stake it may sell to the Chinese company. 
&#8220;Chevron looks as though it is trying to strengthen its
relationship with PetroChina, presumably with the intention to
have it participate in Wheatstone expansion,&#8221; Wilson said. 
The initial agreement doesn&#8217;t preclude a supply deal
between PetroChina and Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the Australian
producer advancing plans for the Pluto and Browse LNG
developments, he said. It indicates China is &#8220;not finished with
their willingness to contract Australian LNG,&#8221; he said. 
Chevron in August announced its ninth gas discovery off
Australia in 12 months as it advances with Gorgon and Wheatstone.
The San Ramon, California-based company has found enough gas to
support a Gorgon expansion, Blackwell said yesterday. 
&#8220;As we continue to discover more gas, expansions at Gorgon
and Wheatstone become more likely,&#8221; he said. 
Chevron initially plans to produce 8.6 million tons of LNG
a year from two Wheatstone units, known as trains, located near
the town of Onslow, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of Perth. 
Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to take 4.1 million tons of
LNG a year from Wheatstone. Korea Gas Corp. said it would buy
almost 2 million tons of LNG a year under an initial accord that
also gives it a 5 percent stake in the venture. 
LNG is gas chilled to liquid form for transportation by
ship between points not connected by pipelines.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by three former female employees who claim they faced
discrimination in pay and fewer opportunities for promotion than
men at the firm. 
&#8220;The violations of its female employees&#8217; rights are
systemic, are based upon companywide policies and practices, and
are the result of unchecked gender bias that pervades Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s corporate culture,&#8221; the women said in a complaint filed
in federal court in Manhattan yesterday. 
H. Cristina Chen-Oster, a former vice president; Lisa
Parisi,  a former managing director; and Shanna Orlich, a former
associate, seek to represent all female Goldman employees with
those job titles. 
The women seek unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Goldman Sachs to remedy the &#8220;systemic sex
discrimination&#8221; at the firm, according to the complaint. 
&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit,&#8221; said Lucas van
Praag, a Goldman spokesman. &#8220;People are critical to our
business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop
and retain outstanding women professionals.&#8221;

Lehman Sues CIBC, Says Claim Change Cost $3 Billion 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its creditors were
deprived of more than $3 billion they were due to receive from
collateralized debt obligation deals because its claims lost
priority as a result of its bankruptcy filing two years ago, the
bank said in a lawsuit. 
Lehman sued to recover $1.3 billion it claims it was owed
by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in connection with one
of the biggest of the 43 CDO deals it was involved in. 
Lehman is &#8220;entitled to a declaration that the purported
termination of the note purchase agreement was null and void and
CIBC&#8217;s obligation to pay amounts due&#8221; remains in force and
effect, the company said in court documents filed Sept. 14 in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
The former investment bank, whose bankruptcy was the
biggest in U.S. history with assets of $639 billion, has said
creditors may have to wait years to recover about 15 cents to 44
cents on the dollar. Any money from lawsuits would swell those
amounts. Filing several lawsuits yesterday over the change in
claims priorities, the bank beat the two-year deadline for so-
called fraudulent-transfer suits. 
Lehman, based in New York, said it had contracts giving it
senior payment priority in derivative deals, which were replaced
with junior payment priority after the bank filed for bankruptcy
protection. The flip was improper, Lehman said in suing the U.S.
Bank National Association, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s trust unit and
dozens of companies that issued notes. 
In the CDO deals, Lehman&#8217;s right to priority payment was
replaced by noteholders, who received proceeds from the swap
agreements, Lehman said. 
Canadian Imperial, based in Toronto, said the matter is not
new and has been disclosed in earnings statements since the
fourth quarter of 2009. The Toronto-based bank had a C$895
million ($869 million) gain in the fourth quarter of 2008 from
the reduction of an unfunded commitment on a note issued by a
CDO. Lehman was a guarantor of a related credit default swap
agreement with that CDO, according to Canadian Imperial
statements. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that the CDO indenture trustee&#8217;s
actions were fully supported by the terms of the governing
contracts and the relevant legal standards,&#8221; the bank said in a
statement yesterday.

Two Iowa Egg Farms Are Sued Over Salmonella Outbreak 
People from six U.S. states sued two Iowa egg farms,
accusing them of failing to prevent an outbreak of salmonella
poisoning. 
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
said that as many as 1,519 diagnosed case reported since May 1
may be linked to eggs from the Wright County Egg farm in Galt
and Hillandale Farms of Iowa in New Hampton. 
&#8220;Self-policing doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; Kenneth Moll, a lawyer for
the consumers, said yesterday at a press conference announcing
the suit was filed in federal court in Chicago. The farms failed
to follow U.S. regulations to prevent contamination, he said. 
Wright, the trade name for Quality Egg LLC, and Hillandale
have recalled 550 million eggs since the outbreak was detected.
It is the largest instance of salmonella poisoning since the
Atlanta-based CDC began tracking cases more than 30 years ago. 
Salmonella can cause fever, abdominal cramps and severe
diarrhea. It can lead to fatal complications in infants, the
elderly and people with weakened immune systems. 
Hinda Mitchell, an outside spokeswoman for Wright County
Egg, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking
comment. Hillandale&#8217;s outside spokeswoman, Julie DeYoung, also
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. 
The case is Dwyer v. Quality Egg LLC, 10-cv-05847, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Soros Insider Trading Case to Be Reviewed by Court 
Billionaire investor George Soros won a bid to have the
European Court of Human Rights review his French insider-trading
conviction from 2002, one of his lawyers said yesterday. 
The court notified Soros it will rule on the complaint
without a hearing, based on submissions by the parties, Ron
Soffer, a Paris-based attorney, said in a telephone interview. 
&#8220;We hope that the court will issue a final ruling in the
same spirit and are certain that the conviction will be
overturned as a result,&#8221; said Soffer, who&#8217;s working with London
lawyer Anthony Lester, on the complaint. 
Soros, 80, was convicted of insider trading and ordered to
repay 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million) he&#8217;d made from a 1988
purchase of Societe Generale SA shares after a Paris court found
he&#8217;d acted with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover
target. 
Soros turned to the human rights tribunal after he lost his
appeal to Cour de Cassation, France&#8217;s highest appeals court,
which quashed the fine while upholding the conviction. 
French stock market regulators didn&#8217;t pursue Soros, saying
insider trading laws were too vague to determine whether he&#8217;d
broken them. 
Toyota Urges U.S. Judge to Throw Out Lawsuits Over Acceleration 
Toyota Motor Corp. urged a U.S. judge to dismiss lawsuits
over sudden acceleration claims saying they&#8217;re based on
anecdotes and fail to identify any specific defects in the
vehicles. 
Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest automaker, faces more than 300
federal and state lawsuits including proposed class actions over
economic losses and claims of personal injuries or deaths
related to allegations the vehicles suddenly accelerated and
couldn&#8217;t be stopped. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs infer negligence and strict liability on the
part of Toyota based on unsubstantiated circumstantial
information,&#8221; the automaker said in papers filed in federal
court in Santa Ana, California, Sept. 13. 
The automaker, based in Toyota City, Japan, has recalled
more than 8 million vehicles worldwide in the past year for
defects including pedals that stuck or snagged on floor mats. 
A hearing on Toyota&#8217;s request to dismiss the lawsuits is
scheduled for Nov. 19 in Santa Ana. 
Shiori Hashimoto, a spokeswoman for the automaker in Tokyo

Trials/Appeals 
Father-Son Developers Hid Assets in &#8216;Web of Lies,&#8217; U.S. Says 
A father and son who built hotels used a &#8220;web of lies&#8221; to
hide income and assets including Miami Beach mansions, luxury
cars, a yacht and a helicopter from U.S. tax authorities, a
Florida federal prosecutor told jurors. 
Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
concealed their wealth behind nominee owners of companies in tax
havens while reporting annual income of no more than about
$46,000 a year, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Neiman said
yesterday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
&#8220;This is a case of greed, deception and manipulation,&#8221;
Neiman said at the start of the trial. The men cheated the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service &#8220;through a web of lies, forged
documents and false statements,&#8221; he said. 
An attorney for Cohen Assor and his son countered that the
evidence will show that the men never thought they broke the
law. He denied charges that they hid ownership of one Miami
Beach home valued at $26 million and another worth $20 million,
and that they failed to declare $45 million in investments,
commercial properties worth $55 million and cars including a
Rolls-Royce Phantom and a Porsche Carrera GT. 
Michael Pasano, a defense attorney, said foreign companies
employing the men owned the assets, and they paid taxes on their
income. They were &#8220;idea-rich but cash- and asset-poor&#8221; while
helping other people make money, Pasano said in his opening
statement. One owner of their companies was Cohen Assor&#8217;s
brother-in-law in Venezuela, Pasano said. 
The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).

Shapiro Pleads Guilty in $880 Million Ponzi Scheme 
Nevin Shapiro, the former owner of Capitol Investments USA
Inc. and a booster of college athletics, pleaded guilty to
running an $880 million Ponzi scheme. 
Shapiro, 41, of Miami Beach, Florida, admitted yesterday in
Newark, New Jersey, federal court that he defrauded more than 50
investors who lost between $50 million and $100 million in his
bogus wholesale-grocery distribution business. He said he used
new investors&#8217; money to pay earlier ones, as well as to fund a
lavish lifestyle. 
Shapiro admitted to stealing $35 million to pay illegal
gambling debts, make mortgage payments on a $5 million house,
and buy floor seats to Miami Heat basketball games. Shapiro, who
gave $150,000 to the University of Miami for an athletic lounge,
said he gave cash or gifts to dozens of student-athletes. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. Shapiro, 10-cr-00471, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). The SEC case is
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Shapiro, 10-cv-21281, U.S.

Coffey Won&#8217;t Return to Law After Electoral Defeat 
Sean Coffey, the lawyer who won more than $6.15 billion in
settlements for WorldCom Inc. investors, has no plans to return
to practicing law after his defeat in a run for New York
Attorney General. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m retired from the practice of law,&#8221; Coffey, 54, said
in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see returning to
practicing law, certainly in the near term.&#8221; 
Coffey came in third in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary for
the state&#8217;s top lawyer job with 16 percent of the vote, based on
98 percent of precincts reporting, behind winner Eric T.
Schneiderman and Kathleen Rice, according to the New York Times. 
Coffey, a former partner at New York&#8217;s Bernstein Litowitz
Berger  Grossmann LLP, which represents investors in
securities-fraud lawsuits against companies, won the WorldCom
settlements in 2004 and 2005 following a collapse of the company
linked to accounting fraud. A novel settlement with WorldCom&#8217;s
former directors required them to pay a portion, a precedent
that reverberated in boardrooms nationwide. 
Coffey left Bernstein Litowitz in October to run for public
office for the first time, seeking to succeed Andrew Cuomo, who
is running for governor. 
Coffey said he may teach law as an adjunct professor, and
is considering writing an article about his 11 months running
for office, for which he kept a diary. He said he also hopes to
do some traveling with his family.

Johnson  Johnson said it will buy
the rest of vaccine maker Crucell NV it doesn&#8217;t already own for
$2.3 billion, expanding in flu shots to bolster sales after two
former top-selling drugs lost patent protection. 
JJ&#8217;s proposal to pay 24.75 euros a share, a 58 percent
premium over Crucell&#8217;s closing price yesterday, pushed the Dutch
company&#8217;s stock up the most in 10 years. Crucell, based in
Leiden, Netherlands, will urge investors to sell stock to JJ,
owner of an 18 percent stake, the companies said in a statement. 
The deal would be the biggest for JJ, the world&#8217;s largest
health products company, since its 2006 purchase of Pfizer
Inc.&#8217;s consumer unit for $16.6 billion. JJ, which had $18.9
billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30, has
the resources to make purchases &#8220;whatever the cost may be,&#8221;
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Weldon told
analysts on a Jan. 26 conference call. 
&#8220;Crucell would give JJ a vaccine platform at a time when
the vaccine business is becoming increasingly attractive because
of its cost-effectiveness, limited exposure to generics and
growth opportunities,&#8221; said Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at
Wells Fargo Securities in New York, in a research note today. 
Vaccine Market 
The global market for vaccines totaled $22.1 billion last
year, up from $19 billion in 2008, and will expand 9.7 percent
annually in the next five years, said Kalorama Information, a
market research company, in an Aug. 12 report. The sector is
dominated by five drugmakers, led by London-based
GlaxoSmithKline Plc with almost a quarter of the market,
Kalorama said. 
&#8220;If anything, JJ is a little late to the game,&#8221; said
Jeff Jonas, an analyst at Gabelli  Co. in Rye, New York, in a
telephone interview today. 
Crucell rose 8.71 euros, or 56 percent, to close at 24.40
euros in Amsterdam trading. JJ, based in New Brunswick, New
Jersey, rose 28 cents to $61.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. 
&#8220;There will not be a higher bid,&#8221; said Fabian Smeets, an
analyst at Rabo Securities in Amsterdam, in an interview. &#8220;The
shareholder base is very diverse, and it will be difficult to
band them together to force a higher bid.&#8221; 
JJ bought a stake in Crucell in September 2009 for about
300 million euros, forming a partnership for flu shots and
therapies eight months after Wyeth abandoned a deal with the
Dutch company. 
&#8216;Nice Premium&#8217; 
The transaction would value Crucell at about 57 times this
year&#8217;s estimated earnings, compared with a median multiple of
about 36 times profit in biotechnology deals in the past year. 
&#8220;This is a nice premium,&#8221; said Tom Muller, an Amsterdam-
based analyst at Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers NV, who has a
&#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Crucell. &#8220;It shows that the company has
created value over the past years. The shareholders will be
willing to sell.&#8221; 
JJ has announced completion of 34 deals in the last five
years, with an average value of $1.37 billion and an average
premium of 40 percent. 
Barclays Capital advised Crucell on the transaction.
Johnson  Johnson didn&#8217;t say whether it used an adviser. 
Vaccine companies are gaining from revived interest after
last year&#8217;s influenza pandemic. Best-selling shots such as
Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Prevnar, to fight pneumonia in children, also have
kindled drugmakers&#8217; interest in vaccines, once deemed difficult
to make and unprofitable. 
Collaboration 
JJ and Crucell said in September last year they would
partner on new influenza shots, including a so-called universal
vaccine to prevent most strains of flu, a goal that has eluded
scientists for about 60 years. 
Crucell now &#8220;feels at home in the JJ family of
companies,&#8221; Crucell CEO Ronald Brus said today on a conference
call. The companies expect to complete the deal by the end of
the year, Brus said. Last year, after JJ&#8217;s initial purchase,
Brus said that &#8220;for the time being, we&#8217;re very happy that we&#8217;re
independent.&#8221; 
&#8220;The most-important thing is that we know how we work with
the JJ management,&#8221; Brus said on today&#8217;s call. &#8220;We are
excited about how successful that collaboration was. This is now
a time we feel comfortable discussing a full acquisition.&#8221; He
declined to comment on other potential offers. 
Crucell&#8217;s Strength 
JJ said it plans to keep Crucell&#8217;s facilities, retain
senior management and maintain employment levels. 
&#8220;Crucell&#8217;s strength in the manufacture, discovery and
commercialization of vaccines would create a strong platform for
Johnson  Johnson,&#8221; the U.S. drugmaker said in a statement
today. 
Sales of Risperdal, an antipsychotic, reached $4.18 billion
in 2006, accounting for 7.8 percent of JJ&#8217;s sales. Topamax, a
migraine medication, peaked at $2.73 million in 2008, 4.3
percent of total revenue, before it lost patent protection. 
With competition from generic copies increasing, &#8220;vaccines
are increasingly regarded as a key revenue generator&#8221; for
larger drugmakers, said Giles Somers, an analyst with London-
based Datamonitor Plc, in an e-mail. &#8220;Backed by JJ&#8217;s global
sales and marketing capabilities, Crucell could compete more
effectively with Big Pharma players already in the vaccine
space.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s decision yesterday to set up a research center with the
Lithuanian government may stoke concern that Estonia and Latvia
are falling behind as the Baltic neighbors vie for foreign
investment after Europe&#8217;s deepest recessions. 
Lithuania has attracted since the beginning of last year
investments from international companies including London-based
Barclays Plc, which opened an information technology center in
Vilnius, and Englewood, Colorado-based Western Union Co., which
plans to establish a regional service center in the country. 
Lithuania is winning as Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius
acts as &#8220;investment czar,&#8221; said Kitty Kubo, who heads the
foresight division of the Estonian Development Fund in Tallinn,
which advises the country&#8217;s government. Estonian lawmakers
haven&#8217;t acted on the fund&#8217;s suggestion that they name a top
official to head the country&#8217;s investment drive, she said. 
&#8220;The doors of companies such as IBM are open for a prime
minister, even when it is difficult for an investment promotion
agency to get its foot in the door,&#8221; Kubo said. &#8220;If Lithuania
continues successfully, it has a good chance of grabbing the
best investments in the region and the best talents with it.&#8221; 
The competition is vital as the Baltic states try to revive
growth after their economies shrank by 20-25 percent from peak
levels during the global recession, according to an
International Monetary Fund report released this week. 
Estonia is the Baltic region&#8217;s traditional leader in
foreign direct investment, with $16.2 billion of accumulated
FDI, according to the World Investment Report 2010 by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Lithuania is second
at $13.8 billion, followed by Latvia&#8217;s $11.7 billion. 
Gap Closing 
Lithuania narrowed the gap last year as the stock of
foreign investment rose 7 percent, compared with Estonia&#8217;s 3
percent drop and Latvia&#8217;s 2 percent increase, the report shows. 
Kubilius&#8217; government plans to boost FDI to 20 billion euros
($26 billion) within five years by focusing on computer services
and energy as the country seeks to establish itself as a service
hub for the Baltic and Nordic regions, Economy Minister Dainius Kreivys said in June. 
While all three countries promote their European Union
membership, central location and cheap, well-educated workers,
Estonia leads its neighbors in the World Bank&#8217;s Ease of Doing
Business rankings. Estonia placed 24th in the most recent
survey, Lithuania 26th and Latvia 27th. 
Estonia&#8217;s &#8220;slight edge&#8221; in business conditions may not be
enough to ensure success, said Christian Ketels, a professor at
Harvard Business School&#8217;s Institute for Strategy and
Competitiveness. 
Right Direction 
&#8220;Countries that market themselves by focusing on their
capabilities in specific clusters of economic activities find it
easier to communicate their specific advantages,&#8221; said Ketels,
who is also a member of the Baltic Development Forum&#8217;s advisory
board. &#8220;As far as the Lithuanian campaign fits that bill, I
think it is a step in the right direction.&#8221; 
Armonk, New York-based IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-
services company, said yesterday it will collaborate with the
Lithuanian government on a research and development center in
Vilnius. Each party will invest 42 million litai ($15.9 million)
annually and share in any patents they develop. 
Estonia, the smallest of the three Baltic nations, &#8220;has
not based its attraction of FDI on specially designed support
schemes,&#8221; the Estonian Investment and Trade agency says on its
website, listing Skype Technologies SA, Playtech Ltd. and
Swedbank AB among successful investors. &#8220;It is our favorable
business environment that makes the difference.&#8221; 
Euro Advantage 
The country may gain an advantage in the competition next
year when it adopts the euro, making it easier for companies to
do business in the countries sharing Europe&#8217;s common currency. 
&#8220;Lithuania&#8217;s marketing efforts have been good, but they
don&#8217;t really offset Estonia&#8217;s euro entry,&#8221; said James Oates,
chief executive officer of Tallinn-based Cicero Capital, and a
former head of east European equities at UBS AG. &#8220;Attracting
investment is one thing, but keeping it in the country is
another as we have seen a number of big investors enter a Baltic
country and leave in a couple of years.&#8221; 
Hilton Hotels Corp. in 2007 closed its Tallinn call center,
which had more than 300 employees, citing growing costs and a
lack of people who were fluent in other European languages.
Hatfield, England-based International Greetings Plc, Europe&#8217;s
only publicly traded maker of wrapping paper and Christmas
cards, closed its two manufacturing plants in Latvia in 2008. 
Regional Good 
Latvia, sandwiched between Estonia and Lithuania, also
advertises itself as a business-friendly country provides a
gateway to the EU and Russia. 
Economy Minister Artis Kampars traveled to China in July to
meet with business leaders and government officials about
potential investment. Andris Ozols, director of the Latvian
development agency, said after the visit that Chinese companies
were interested in Latvia&#8217;s ports, cargo companies, the national
airline and creating a logistics center in the country. 
&#8220;Investments in Lithuania or Latvia are good for Estonia
as we also depend on how their economies perform,&#8221; Estonian
Economy Minister Juhan Parts said in an interview. &#8220;Promotion
of investments needs to be systemic and consistent,&#8221; he said
when asked if Estonia needed more high-level promotion. 
The government needs to do more, Kubo said. 
&#8220;We cannot be complacent and passive in competition for
capital and talent, and just hope that some general conditions
will make us a winner in this contest,&#8221; she said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said Japan&#8217;s intervention to weaken the
yen this week suggests Group of 20 officials coordinated to
support the policy. 
&#8220;The fact they&#8217;ve done it in a week when Washington is so
noisy&#8221; about China&#8217;s renminbi &#8220;is particularly interesting and
suggests to me that behind the scenes that there may be subtle
coordination going on here,&#8221; he said today on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;The renminbi&#8217;s
continued to strengthen. You can build it all into some pretty
well thought out thing going on behind the scenes by the G20
policy makers.&#8221; 
Japan sold yen this week after it touched 82.88 per dollar,
the strongest level since May 1995. The yuan completed its
biggest weekly advance in 28 months after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said yesterday gains in the
currency were &#8220;too slow.&#8221; He said the U.S. will use every
available tool to urge China to let the yuan rise more quickly. 
Chinese authorities have &#8220;only delivered on a small part
of&#8221; yuan loosening, said O&#8217;Neill, who is incoming
chairman of Goldman Sachs&#8217; asset-management unit. &#8220;My
suspicion&#8221; is that &#8220;they&#8217;ve rather cleverly held the timing
back for when they thought it would have its biggest impact in
Washington.&#8221; 
O&#8217;Neill also said Japan&#8217;s intervention was &#8220;the right
thing for them to do.&#8221; The yen was little changed today at
85.72 per dollar, having slid about 2 percent this week.

The best returns in commodities
over the next 12 months will probably be in energy and the
biggest losses in agriculture, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. 
The bank is forecasting a 27 percent advance in energy over
12 months, a 17 percent jump in precious metals and a 15 percent
gain in industrial metals, analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. Agriculture will decline 10
percent, the team forecast. 
&#8220;For the more cyclical commodities, oil and copper, while
continued indications of more supportive policy in the U.S. and
China, better macro data in these key countries, and improving
commodity data have pushed prices higher within their respective
trading ranges, we continue to expect them to break out to the
upside in coming months,&#8221; the analysts wrote in the report. 
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell
1.7 percent this year, led by declines in natural gas, cocoa and
sugar, amid mounting concern about the strength of the global
recovery. Crude, gasoline and heating oil inventories reached a
20-year-high last month as the U.S. Commerce Department said the
economy probably expanded at a 1.6 percent annual pace in the
second quarter from an initially reported 2.4 percent. 
While agriculture is forecast by Goldman to be the only
commodity group to drop over 12 months, the bank raised its
three-month forecasts for corn, cotton, arabica and raw sugar. 
Goldman increased its three-month corn estimate to $4.65 a
bushel from $4.15 and said the market will have a &#8220;further
tightening&#8221; because of demand for ethanol and animal feed.
Wheat prices, which as much as doubled since June, may decline
in the &#8220;medium term,&#8221; Goldman said. 
Coffee Forecast 
The bank also raised its arabica-coffee forecast to $1.80 a
pound from $1.55 and raw-sugar to 20 cents a pound from 15
cents. The cotton estimate increased to 90 cents a pound from 85
cents. The cocoa forecast declined to $2,700 a metric ton from
$3,100. Goldman raised its live-cattle forecast to 105 cents a
pound from 93 cents. 
The bank is forecasting a 19 percent return in the SP GSCI
Enhanced Total Return Index over 12 months. The gauge declined 4
percent this year.

Chevron Corp. and China
Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, are in talks on
developing shale gas, a harder-to-extract form of the fuel that
may exceed conventional reserves in China by as much as 12-fold. 
&#8220;We are in discussions with Sinopec,&#8221; Gareth Johnstone,
the Singapore-based spokesman for the second-biggest U.S. energy
producer, said by e-mail today. &#8220;We are not disclosing further
details at this stage.&#8221; 
China is seeking to tap its unconventional gas resources,
including gas in shale and coal seams, with the help of global
majors like Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Chevron and
Sinopec Group, the country&#8217;s second-largest oil company, may
sign an accord by the year-end to develop shale gas in
southwestern China, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;Energy demand in China is very strong, but its technology
is relatively backward when it comes to developing
unconventional resources,&#8221; said Wang Aochao, head of energy
research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Shanghai. &#8220;In the future,
exploration and production in China will be a long-term area of
cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies.&#8221; 
The world&#8217;s biggest polluting nation is seeking to triple
the use of gas to about 10 percent of energy consumption by 2020
and cut reliance on coal and oil, which produce more emissions. 
China holds 2.46 trillion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves, according to BP&#8217;s Statistical Review of World Energy.
That compares with possibly 30 trillion cubic meters of gas
deposits in shale, a type of sedimentary rock, said China
National Petroleum Corp., the country&#8217;s largest energy company. 
Southwestern Provinces 
Chevron has found a gas block near Guiyang city in Guizhou
province, close to an area that BP and Sinopec Group are
exploring, the Journal said in the report, citing the
unidentified person. Huang Wensheng, a Beijing-based spokesman
for the state-controlled Chinese company, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to calls made to his office or mobile phone. 
Sinopec Group aims to boost its unconventional gas
production capacity to more than 2.5 billion cubic meters a year
by 2015. Unconventional gas resources will be an &#8220;important&#8221;
contributor to earnings within five to 10 years, the company
said on June 1. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s three oil companies, led by PetroChina Co., are
increasing spending on the development of unconventional gas,
including tight gas, coal-bed methane and shale gas,&#8221; Jia
Chengzao, president of the Chinese Petroleum Society and a
former vice president at the China National Petroleum unit. 
&#8216;Massive Production&#8217; 
PetroChina signed an agreement with Shell last year to
explore for shale gas in the Sichuan basin in southwest China.
Shell may invest $1 billion annually in China in the next five
to seven years should two wells there show potential for
commercial production, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said
on Sept. 14. 
It may take China four to five years to achieve commercial
development of shale gas and a &#8220;fairly longer time&#8221; before
&#8220;massive production,&#8221; Jia said. 
Hong Kong-listed PetroChina teamed up with Shell in March
this year to acquire Australian coal-bed gas producer Arrow
Energy Ltd., partly to acquire the expertise needed to help the
company develop China&#8217;s reserves of unconventional gas, Chairman
Jiang Jiemin said then. 
The U.S. last year overtook Russia as the world&#8217;s largest
producer of natural gas as shale-gas output rose to 10 percent
of total supplies from 2 percent in 1990 in what BP&#8217;s Chief
Executive Officer Tony Hayward called a &#8216;quiet revolution.&#8221;

Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, expanded its exploration operations into
Turkey by signing an agreement with the country&#8217;s state oil
company to jointly drill wells in the Black Sea. 
Chevron will buy a 50 percent stake in a western portion of
License 3921, an exploration block about the size of New Jersey
in waters 220 miles (354 kilometers) northwest of the Turkish
capital of Ankara, according to a statement today by the San
Ramon, California-based company. 
State-owned Turkiye Petrolleri AO will be operator of the
initial well currently being drilled and of a well that may be
drilled in 2012, said Chevron, which would take over as operator
thereafter. The U.S. company is expanding into new oil provinces
to keep production rising as access to petroleum reserves around
the world becomes more difficult. 
&#8220;This is an opportunity to build on recent positions we&#8217;ve
acquired in other locations in West Africa, Asia and Europe, and
it&#8217;s a highly prospective new basin for Chevron,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. 
Turkiye Petrolleri plans three wells through the venture
with Chevron that will cost about $750 million, Mehmet Uysal,
chief executive officer for the state oil company, told
reporters at a signing ceremony in Ankara. He said Turkiye
Petrolleri will get a $50 million bonus from Chevron if oil is
found. 
Chevron rose $1.44, or 1.8 percent, to $79.90 as of 4:10
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., which also has a Black Sea venture with
Turkiye Petrolleri, is the largest U.S. oil company.

     Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s $27-a-share deal to acquire Netezza Corp. pushed the
stock above that level, suggesting investors may expect a
competing bid for the analytics-technology provider. 
IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, struck
a cash deal worth about $1.7 billion, according to a statement
from the company today. Marlborough, Massachusetts-based
Netezza&#8217;s stock topped the per-share offer by $1.27. 
Netezza, whose clients include NYSE Euronext and Estee
Lauder Cos., integrates hardware with programs that store and
analyze data. It&#8217;s one of the few data-warehousing companies
that&#8217;s gained customers, making it an attractive buy for large
technology corporations looking to increase sales, said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. 
&#8220;Larger companies are finding it harder to grow so when
they see an interesting technology, they&#8217;re willing to pay up
for it,&#8221; said New York-based Bachman, who rates IBM
&#8220;outperform.&#8221; Possible counter-bidders could include Hewlett-
Packard Co., Dell Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., he said. 
Netezza rose $3.67, or 15 percent, to $28.27 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. IBM, based in Armonk,
New York, gained $1.60 to $131.79. Teradata Corp., which also
provides analytics and storage technology, climbed 7.5 percent
after analysts cited it as a potential target.

General Motors Co., which is making
plans to sell its stock to the public, has made its first
campaign contributions since 2008, Federal Election Commission
reports show. 
Detroit-based GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury,
resumed donations through its political action committee,
according to the company&#8217;s August FEC report, and has given
$91,500 to candidates of both political parties. The PAC
contributed $710,008 for the 2008 elections. 
&#8220;Emerging as a new company, we are participating in the
political process,&#8221; said Greg Martin, a GM spokesman. &#8220;We will
not sit on the sidelines while our competitors in other
industries have their voices heard.&#8221; 
Among those receiving GM contributions were Representative
Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, and the
leadership PAC of House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland
Democrat. 
GM emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009 and received a $50
billion taxpayer bailout. The company is seeking to raise as
much as $16 billion through its initial public offering.

SAIC Motor Corp. said it may invest
in the initial public offering of partner General Motors Co.,
cementing ties between the biggest U.S. and Chinese automakers. 
SAIC will consider investing in GM if &#8220;conditions are
favorable,&#8221; Chairman Hu Maoyuan said in Shanghai. The company
hasn&#8217;t yet made a decision whether to make the investment and is
waiting for the details of the share sale, he said today. 
&#8220;GM is our important strategic partner,&#8221; Hu said. &#8220;We
are not clear about the details of its IPO. We will make the
right decision once we know details.&#8221; 
The automakers, which have made cars together in China for
more than a decade, said in December they would also sell low-
cost vehicles in India. GM filed for an IPO in August as the
U.S. government seeks to pare the 61 percent stake it gained in
the company through its bankruptcy and $50 billion taxpayer
bailout last year. 
&#8220;It would be a political hot potato if the already-
unpopular bailout of GM was followed by a Chinese company
acquiring a stake,&#8221; Aaron Bragman, an analyst with IHS
Automotive in Northville, Michigan, said in a telephone
interview. 
GM&#8217;s initial public offering will be open to overseas
investors, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement on its website.
Retail and institutional investors will be offered shares, and
the Treasury &#8220;will not involve itself in decisions regarding
allocation of shares to specific buyers,&#8221; the department said. 
GM &#8220;cannot comment on speculation surrounding a public
offering,&#8221; Shanghai-based spokesman Mike Albano said in an e-
mailed statement on Sept. 18. 
Chinese Sales 
The Detroit-based automaker, whose partners in China also
include Wuling Motors Co. and China FAW Group Corp., sold 1.2
million vehicles in the nation during the six months ended June
30, according to a company filing related to the IPO. 
Combined income from the joint ventures with SAIC and
Wuling rose to $734 million in the first six months of the year
from $298 million a year earlier. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a bad idea for GM and SAIC to further their ties
if it means getting GM better ingrained in the Chinese market,&#8221;
IHS Automotive&#8217;s Bragman said. &#8220;That&#8217;s where the money is going
to be made for the industry.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s wholesale deliveries of passenger cars increased
18.7 percent to 1.02 million units in August, compared with 13.6
percent growth in July, the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said in an e-mailed statement on Sept. 9. 
China Offsets Slump 
Sales in markets such as China and India are helping offset
slumping demand in the U.S. and Europe. China&#8217;s auto sales may
rise to 16 million this year, the association said last month,
boosting its forecast from a previous estimate of 15 million. 
GM is &#8220;in great shape&#8221; to hold an offering, United Auto
Workers President Bob King said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview. 
&#8220;It will actually help them sell more product when they&#8217;ve
done the IPO,&#8221; King said. &#8220;I think the American public will
see that they&#8217;re a strong and healthy company.&#8221; 
Carlos Ghosn, the head of the Renault SA-Nissan Motor Co.
alliance, said today that he isn&#8217;t interested in investing in
GM. He spoke at a plant opening in Zhengzhou, central China.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
mall owner planning to exit bankruptcy next month, agreed to pay
$230 million to heirs of Howard Hughes to settle a dispute over
the Summerlin planned community in Las Vegas. 
The heirs will receive $10 million in cash and the
remainder in cash or new General Growth common stock soon after
it leaves bankruptcy, the Chicago-based company said today in a
statement. The heirs had disagreed with the company over how to
value Summerlin. 
General Growth, as part of its bankruptcy reorganization,
is separating its traditional retail properties from master-
planned community and commercial real estate operations. General
Growth plans to give existing shareholders the majority of a new
spinoff company now known as Spinco Inc., according to court
filings. Summerlin will be part of Spinco, according to a
regulatory filing. 
&#8220;With this agreement, GGP settles one of the last
remaining material issues impacting the capital structure of the
new GGP and &#8216;Spinco&#8217; as we continue our steady march toward
emergence from bankruptcy,&#8221; Chief Operating Officer Thomas H. Nolan Jr. said in the statement. 
Hughes, a billionaire aviator, industrialist and filmmaker,
died in 1976 at the age of 70. In 1996, Rouse Co. bought his
remaining assets, including 22,500 acres (9,100 hectares) of
land in Nevada. The Hughes heirs were to receive a portion of
profits from future land sales under the deal. 
General Growth bought Rouse in 2004 for $11.3 billion and
assumed the obligation to Hughes heirs. General Growth filed for
bankruptcy protection in April 2009. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp. raised its
quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or 23 percent, to 16 cents a
share and got approval from its board to sell as much as $6
billion in additional debt. 
&#8220;This higher dividend, combined with our ongoing share
repurchase program, reflects our commitment to returning capital
to our shareholders and our confidence in the long-term growth
of the company,&#8221; Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein
said in a statement. 
Microsoft Corp. is planning to sell debt this year to pay
for dividends and share repurchases because too much of its cash
is held overseas, a person familiar with the matter said last
week. The company will try to raise as much as possible without
jeopardizing its debt rating of AAA, the highest available, said
the person, who declined to be named because the plans are
confidential and not completed. 
Bloomberg data had predicted the company would increase its
quarterly dividend by 2 cents a share, while Heather Bellini, an
analyst at ISI Group, predicted an increase of 4 cents in a note
to clients this month. 
Microsoft fell 28 cents to $25.15 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have dropped 17
percent this year. 
A quarterly dividend of 16 cents would yield 2.5 percent.

Samuel Palmisano, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp., said improving
the U.S. electric-transmission grid depends on providing better
information to consumers. 
Companies shouldn&#8217;t wait for government to set standards
for data and technologies to create a &#8220;smart grid,&#8221; which lets
consumers monitor their energy use and take conservation steps
that can save energy and money, Palmisano said today at the
Gridwise Global Forum in Washington. 
&#8220;There is an incredible buy-in for change&#8221; in the U.S.,
and backers of new energy technology should tap into the
sentiment, he said in a speech opening the conference. 
A smart electric grid is part of a push by companies and
regulators to make the nation&#8217;s energy system more efficient,
eliminating a need to build new generation sources that would
raise electricity prices and add to greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Michael Morris, CEO of American Electric Power Co. of
Columbus, Ohio, said during a panel discussion with Palmisano
and Anders Eldrup, CEO of Dong Energy A/S, Denmark&#8217;s largest
utility, that consumers don&#8217;t think about how they use energy,
and don&#8217;t particularly want to. 
&#8220;We need to get the voters, the taxpayers, interested in
these issues,&#8221; with smart-meter systems that are simple to use,
Morris said.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s Adam Opel unit
will invest 500 million euros ($657 million) to start production
of three new engine series in its Hungarian plant, the company
said today. 
The enlarged factory, located in the western town of
Szentgotthard, will have an annual capacity of 500,000 engines,
Opel said in a statement distributed to reporters in Budapest
today. The engines will have low fuel consumption and low
carbon-emission levels. 
Production will start at the end of 2012 and the company
will hire 800 additional workers, according to the statement. 
Opel&#8217;s reasons for putting the investment into Hungary
include &#8220;the level of education, the economic framework and the
fact that Szentgotthard is located in an appropriate region of
the European Union,&#8221; thus qualifying the plant for investment
subsidy, Reinald Hoben, Opel&#8217;s manufacturing chief, said at a
press conference in Budapest. 
Hungary was the first European Union member-country to get
an International Monetary Fund bailout in 2008 and went through
its worst recession since 1991 last year. The country is
counting on resurgent demand in the euro region, which buys 60
percent of products made or assembled there to boost growth.
These include Audi cars, Opel engines and Nokia Oyj phones. 
The government will decide by mid-October on the level of
subsidy it will offer Opel, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said at
the press conference. Only investments that &#8220;will return state
aid in four years at the level of the national economy&#8221; will be
supported, Orban said. 
Production at the expanded plant will be &#8220;highly
flexible&#8221; and will include both diesel and gasoline engines,
Opel said. 
The engines will be exported by rail to Opel/Vauxhall
plants in Germany, Britain, Poland and Spain.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one
of the best-performing financial shares in the past decade
and it beat the SP 500 Stock Index, helping to explain Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s $125 million in cash bonuses during the period. 
Some investments did even better. One-year certificates of
deposit earned an average rate of 3.17 percent in the last 10
years, beating the 2.78 percent annual total return on Goldman

officers, including Blankfein, by pointing to the value they
generate for shareholders. Yet over the last decade, the SP 500
Financials Index, which includes 80 members, has dropped 49
percent. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan
Stanley have lost money for shareholders, while JPMorgan Chase 
Co. returned an annual 1.23 percent, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;Some of the financial stocks were of course total
catastrophes,&#8221; such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Bear
Stearns Cos. and Citigroup, all examples of a &#8220;financial sector
innovating itself into obscurity,&#8221; said John C. Bogle, the 81-
year-old founder of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds.

Microsoft Corp., one of four non-
financial U.S. companies with AAA ratings, sold $4.75 billion of
bonds, including three- and five-year maturities at the lowest
coupons on record. 
The company&#8217;s $1 billion of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013
and $1.75 billion of 1.625 percent debt maturing in 2015 have
the lowest interest rates of more than 3,500 securities in the
Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate Index of investment-grade
company debt. 
The world&#8217;s biggest software maker sold the bonds a day
after its board boosted its dividend and approved the issuance
of as much as $6 billion in new debt. The offering came as
yields on investment-grade debt fell to 3.718 percent, the
lowest level since daily records began on Oct. 31, 1986,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. 
&#8220;A name like Microsoft is always going to garner the
biggest and best investors,&#8221; said Anne Daley, managing director
at Barclays Capital in New York, which helped underwrite the
sale. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, also sold $1
billion each of 10- and 30-year bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 4.5 percent, 30-year debt tied for
the lowest coupon with an issue last month from Johnson 
Johnson. 
Cash Held Overseas 
Proceeds from Microsoft&#8217;s sale may be used to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, stock buybacks and acquisitions,
the company said today in a regulatory filing. The company also
plans to pay for dividends and share repurchases because much of
its cash is held overseas, a person familiar with the matter
said last week. 
Peter Wootton, a Microsoft spokesman, wasn&#8217;t available to
comment today. 
The 3-year notes yield 25 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries; the 5-year debt pays a 40 basis-point
spread; the 3 percent securities due in 2020 pay 55 basis
points; and 30-year bonds pay 83 basis points, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 
Spreads on investment-grade debt rose 1 basis point today
to 184 basis points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show. 
Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. 
Higher Dividend 
Microsoft reported $36.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments at the end of last quarter. Much of that is held
overseas, forcing the company to pay taxes on any of the money
used for dividends or stock repurchases. 
Microsoft boosted its quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or 23
percent, to 16 cents a share yesterday. 
The dividend and share repurchase programs reflect
Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to returning capital to shareholders and
confidence in its long-term growth prospects, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said yesterday in a statement. 
&#8220;You can take it as a sign of soft expected future stock-
market performance,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. &#8220;Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have a lot of acquisition
opportunities, doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do internally, apparently,
with this capital, so they&#8217;re giving it back to shareholders.&#8221; 
Debut Sale 
Microsoft sold its first bond in May 2009, a $3.75 billion
offering, in a bid to diversify its capital structure and add to
its cash pile for acquisitions, capital expenses and share
buybacks. The sale comprised $2 billion of 2.95 percent, 5-year
notes; $1 billion of 4.2 percent, 10-year debt; and $750 million
of 5.2 percent, 30-year bonds. 
In June, Microsoft raised $1.15 billion of interest-free
financing from its first sale of convertible bonds. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect storm for issuers right now between low
rates, tight spreads and the fact that investors continue to
have cash to put to work,&#8221; Daley said. &#8220;We expect the active
new issue calendar to continue.&#8221; 
In addition to Barclays, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. helped underwrite today&#8217;s sale.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, plans to sell $4.75 billion of bonds a
day after its board boosted the company&#8217;s dividend and approved
the issuance of as much as $6 billion in new debt. 
Proceeds may be used to fund working capital, capital

Washington-based company said today in a regulatory filing that
didn&#8217;t disclose the size or timing of the sale. The bonds may be
sold as soon as today, said a person familiar with the
transaction said, who declined to be identified as terms aren&#8217;t
set. 
Microsoft is marketing the debt after yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds fell to 3.73 percent yesterday, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986. Demand for the securities, from one of
only four nonfinancial U.S. companies with the top credit grade,
will be &#8220;huge across the globe,&#8221; said Mirko Mikelic, a money
manager at Fifth Third Asset Management. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be a name everyone&#8217;s going to
want,&#8221; said Mikelic, who helps oversee $13 billion of fixed-
income assets in Grand Rapids, Michigan. &#8220;It&#8217;s a triple-A
credit, great company, well-run, what&#8217;s there not to like, other
than the pricing?&#8221; 
Microsoft plans to sell $1 billion each of 3-, 10- and 30-
year bonds and $1.75 billion of 5-year debt, the person said. 
Projected Yields 
The 3-year notes may yield 25 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the 5-year debt may pay a spread of
40 basis points, the 10-year securities may yield 55 basis
points more than benchmarks, and the 30-year bonds may pay a
spread of 83 basis points, the person said. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. 
The company will use proceeds to pay for dividends and
share repurchases because much of its cash is held overseas, a
person familiar with the matter said last week. Peter Wootton, a
spokesman for the company, wasn&#8217;t immediately available to
comment today. 
Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. JJ sold $1.1 billion of
bonds at the lowest interest rates on record for 10-year and 30-
year securities last month, according to Citigroup Inc. data
going back to 1981. 
&#8220;The Treasury markets have lower rates than mid-August and
that creates the likelihood that Microsoft will price at lower
rates than the JJ deal,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. 
Overseas Cash 
Microsoft reported $36.8 billion in cash and short-term

JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Cantor
Fitzgerald LP&#8217;s former head of debt capital markets, Irvin Goldman, to help manage the second-largest U.S. bank&#8217;s capital. 
Goldman, who left Cantor in 2007, started this month as a
managing director for JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office,
according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to
be identified because the hire wasn&#8217;t announced publicly. The
group manages the interest rate and foreign exchange risks of
JPMorgan&#8217;s day-to-day transactions and invests its corporate
portfolio. 
Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment, as did Goldman, reached at his office at the New York-
based bank. 
Goldman left Cantor after helping to rebuild the broker&#8217;s
businesses following the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center, which killed 658 of its 960 New York-based
employees. 
Cantor hired Goldman in June 2003 to expand its bond sales
and trading business and build an asset management unit. Cantor
was named a primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in 2006, becoming the first addition in more than two years
to the group of firms that trade directly with the central bank. 
Before joining Cantor, Goldman worked 13 years at Credit
Suisse First Boston and ran sales and trading for interest-rate
products, according to a 2003 statement on Cantor&#8217;s website.

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. had their third-quarter earnings estimates cut by
Deutsche Bank AG, which cited weak trading revenue. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s earnings-per-share estimate was lowered to
$1.95 from $3 and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s was trimmed to 15 cents from
50 cents, analysts led by Michael Carrier said in a note to
clients yesterday. The bank has a &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation on both
stocks. 
Capital markets in the third quarter &#8220;were mostly weak
across the board following a challenging second quarter,
including muted equity trading,&#8221; the Deutsche Bank analysts
said. &#8220;The combination of derisking during the European crises,
ongoing regulatory reform uncertainty and negative macro data
points led investors to stay out of the markets.&#8221; 
Deutsche Bank said it&#8217;s expecting another subdued quarter
at New York-based Goldman Sachs because of poor conditions in
trading and &#8220;soft investment banking.&#8221; Morgan Stanley, also
based in New York, may post a &#8220;weak&#8221; quarter because of its
trading results and slowing revenue from investment banking,
asset management and wealth management, the analysts said. 
Goldman Sachs fell $1.90, or 1.3 percent, to $149.50 at

General Mills Inc., the maker of
Cheerios and Green Giant frozen vegetables, said first-quarter
profit gained 12 percent, helped by sales of a chocolate-
flavored cereal and new snack bars. 
Net income advanced to $472.1 million, or 70 cents a share,
the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. Profit
excluding some items totaled 64 cents a share, exceeding by 1
cent the average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Kendall Powell lured U.S. consumers
with new products such as Chocolate Cheerios and Wheaties Fuel
even as they kept tight budgets. Industrywide, food makers have
increased promotional programs, cutting prices of their products
at grocery stores, said Christopher Growe, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus  Co. in St. Louis. 
General Mills&#8217; &#8220;sales were above our estimate, which was
surprising given all the fears around heavy promotional spending
in the U.S. market,&#8221; said Growe, who recommends buying the
shares. &#8220;That figure is good not only for General Mills, but
good to see for the food industry.&#8221; 
General Mills rose 43 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $36.10 at

shares had gained almost 1 percent this year before today.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. has sold $6.06
billion of corporate bonds for Texas-based energy companies,
excluding utilities, so far this year, more than the $5.03
billion it sold in all of 2009 and the highest amount in at
least a decade. 
The bank, based in New York, is the top arranger of
corporate bonds for coal, oil and natural-gas companies in the
Lone Star state this year with 20 percent of the market, the
largest share controlled by a single firm since 2003, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Energy producers and companies that provide them with
equipment and pipeline services are benefiting from borrowing
costs near the lowest on record, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. They&#8217;re also capitalizing on investor
discontent with equity markets, said Sean Sexton with Fitch
Ratings Ltd. The value of JPMorgan&#8217;s Texas energy-bond sales
rose even as they fell in number to 25 from 37 in all of 2009. 
&#8220;Even for companies with no near-term need for cash, now&#8217;s
a smart time to refinance bonds set to mature in the latter half
of 2011 or 2012 because nobody&#8217;s sure if interest rates will
still be this low by then,&#8221; said Sexton, managing director of
energy, chemicals and commodities for New York-based Fitch.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to strike while the iron&#8217;s hot.&#8221; 
Energy company bond yields fell to 4.04 percent on Aug. 24,
the lowest on record going back to December 1996, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporates Energy index shows. 
The securities yield 4.07 percent as of Sept. 21, compared
with the overall investment-grade U.S. corporate bond market&#8217;s
yield of 3.73 percent, index data show. 
Motiva, ATP 
JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest Texas energy deals this year included $1
billion in 10- and 30-year bonds sold for Motiva Enterprises
LLC, a joint venture between Saudi Arabia&#8217;s state-owned oil
company and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and $750 million in 5-year
debt for ATP Oil  Gas Corp. Both are Houston-based. 
Almost two-thirds of JPMorgan&#8217;s Texas energy debt sales
occurred during the first half of the year, when the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 equity index lost 7.6 percent of its value. The bank
has dominated the Texas energy debt market for seven of the past
11 years, Bloomberg data showed. Justin Perras, a JPMorgan
spokesman, declined to comment. 
Credit Suisse Group AG was the second-biggest underwriter
this year with $3.07 billion in debt sales for Texas energy
companies on 12 issuances. Duncan King, a spokesman for Credit
Suisse, declined to comment. 
Last year&#8217;s second-best performer, Citigroup Inc., fell to
fourth with $2.87 billion in debt sales, down from $4.2 billion
in 2009. 
Denbury Resources 
The size of JPMorgan&#8217;s Texas underwriting this year ranged
from Motiva&#8217;s $1 billion debt sale to a $50 million issuance for
Plains Exploration  Production Co., a Houston-based oil and gas
explorer. 
Denbury Resources Inc. was JPMorgan&#8217;s highest-paying Texas-
based energy client on a percentage basis. The Plano, Texas-
based oil producer was charged a 2 percent fee on $200 million
in 15-year bonds, Bloomberg data showed. That was more than
double the average 0.963 percent fee JPMorgan collected from the
Texas energy sector this year. 
Oil, gas, coal, oilfield-equipment and pipeline companies
based in Texas sold $30.1 billion in debt during the year
through Sept. 17, compared with $36.6 billion for all of 2009,
Bloomberg data showed. The average size of each deal expanded to
$684 million from $530 million in 2009. 
Before this year, the last time a single firm controlled
more than one-fifth of the Texas energy debt market was in 2003,
when Citigroup underwrote $2.66 billion in sales, or 22 percent
of the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Chevron Corp. may overtake rivals
such as Exxon Mobil Corp., BG Group Plc and state companies in
Indonesia and Algeria to become the fourth-largest liquefied
natural gas producer as new ventures start, an official said. 
Chevron may climb to be second behind Royal Dutch Shell Plc
among non-state companies in 2020, Stephen Del Regno, managing
director for Asia, said at the World LNG Series conference in
Singapore today. Projects in Australia, Africa and South-East
Asia will boost supplies will boost Chevron from its current
ranking of 20 among all producers. 
Chevron&#8217;s Gorgon and Wheatstone ventures in Australia are
among A$200 billion ($192 billion) of proposed LNG ventures in
the Pacific nation targeting Asian demand for cleaner-burning
alternatives to coal, according to figures from the Australian
Petroleum Production  Exploration Association. The biggest of
the projects is Chevron&#8217;s A$43 billion Gorgon development on
Barrow Island off the northwestern coast. 
The share of Asian LNG purchases in the global mix will
drop to 54 percent by 2020 from 64 percent in 2015 as European
LNG purchases rise, according to the presentation. Asia&#8217;s share
was about 63 percent last year, according to BP Plc&#8217;s annual
energy review. 
Qatar Petroleum Ltd. will retain its position as the
world&#8217;s biggest supplier in 2020, according to a presentation by
Del Regno, based on Wood Mackenzie Research Consultancy data.
Shell will be second and Algeria&#8217;s Sonatrach third. 
Chevron said on Sept. 16 that it aims to supply China
National Petroleum Corp., the nation&#8217;s largest oil company, with
LNG from its proposed Wheatstone project. 
LNG is natural gas that&#8217;s been chilled to liquid form for
transportation by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline.

Bonds from Microsoft Corp., the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, rose on their first day of
trading amid investor demand for top-rated corporate debt that&#8217;s
outstripping limited supply. 
Microsoft&#8217;s $1 billion of 30-year, 4.5 percent debt rose
0.274 cent to 99.185 cents on the dollar, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The company&#8217;s bonds were the most actively
traded U.S. corporate securities, with 314 transactions of more
than $1 million, Trace data show. 
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is one of only four
non-financial U.S. companies with top credit ratings, making it
attractive to institutional investors that are required to buy
investment-grade debt, said Guy LeBas, a fixed-income strategist
with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. The others with the same AAA
grade -- Automatic Data Processing, Johnson  Johnson and Exxon
Mobil Corp. -- aren&#8217;t likely to issue bonds soon, LeBas said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s virtually no supply of that debt,&#8221; said LeBas,
whose Philadelphia-based firm provides financial advisory
services. Johnson  Johnson issued 30-year debt last month
that&#8217;s tied with Microsoft for the lowest coupon. 
Microsoft sold $4.75 billion of bonds yesterday in a four-
part offering, including three- and five-year maturities at the
lowest coupons on record. The software maker issued $1 billion
of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013 and $1.75 billion of 1.625
percent debt maturing in 2015. 
The company&#8217;s debt is &#8220;almost Treasury like&#8221; in its lack
of risk, said William Larkin, who helps manage $500 million in
fixed-income assets at Cabot Money Management in Salem,
Massachusetts. The software maker reported $36.8 billion in cash
and short-term investments at the end of last quarter. 
Microsoft&#8217;s $1 billion of 3 percent bonds due in 2020
climbed 0.872 cent to 100.008 cents on the dollar. Bonds often
rise in first-day trading because initial offerings are priced
with slightly wider spreads to make sure they&#8217;re sold, LeBas
said.

International Business Machines
Corp. is developing a process that may pack more music on Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPod Nanos or make solar panels more efficient. 
IBM scientists are unveiling today a technique for
observing atomic reactions in real-time. It may help
manufacturers make smaller devices with greater memory, Spike
Narayan, an IBM researcher, said in a phone interview. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to make things on a small scale, but to
understand how things behave going down to the smaller scale,
that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s needed,&#8221; said Narayan, who manages science
and technology at IBM&#8217;s Almaden Research Center in San Jose,
California. 
IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
invested about $6 billion, or about 6 percent of its sales, in
research projects last year. The company is aiming to design
more efficient methods to process and store information as
customers demand more computing power. 
The technique may enable manufacturers to make hard-drives
that hold 1,000 times more data than now, said Rob Enderle, a
principal analyst at Enderle Group. One version of the iPhone 4,
Apple&#8217;s newest model with features including video calls, Web
surfing and a music player, has a capacity of 32 gigabytes. 
&#8220;Think of iPhones that, instead of having gigabytes, have
terabytes -- that&#8217;s what this could mean,&#8221; Enderle said. One
terabyte is equivalent to about 1,000 gigabytes. &#8220;It allows
them to put vastly more data in a vastly smaller space,&#8221; the
San Jose-based analyst said. 
Atom Magnetism 
Using a special microscope that images atoms, scientists
moved an atom with voltage and measured its magnetism at various
points, observing how it acted at a speed 1 million times faster
than has been possible. The study enabled them to time how long
an atom can hold 1 byte of data. For an iron atom on a copper
surface, it was 200 nanoseconds, comparable to typical dynamic
random access memory, which is used in personal computers,
Narayan said. 
Now scientists may use the technique to see how certain
combinations hold data, and how few atoms are needed for various
functions. 
Observing atom&#8217;s reactions in real-time also has
implications outside the storage industry, Narayan said.
Scientists could manipulate how atoms react to light, helping
make solar panels more efficient, he said. The technique could
help study how atoms in bodies consume energy, he said. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, makes about $1 billion a
year in licensing revenue, according to regulatory filings. 
This month, IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano
criticized rival Hewlett Packard Co. for cutting investments in
research and development, saying it forces them to pay more for
acquisitions. HP agreed to pay $2.35 billion this month for
data-storage maker 3Par, after a bidding contest with Dell Inc. 
IBM fell 90 cents to $131.67 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed this
year.

General Motors Co. will probably
seek to raise $8 billion to $10 billion in an initial public
offering in November, a smaller sale than the automaker
originally targeted, said two people familiar with the matter. 
The U.S. Treasury Department, which owns 61 percent of GM,
is more interested in fetching a higher share price to
eventually recoup its $49.5 billion investment than in cashing
out a bigger portion of its position, said the people who asked
not to be identified because the discussions are private. 
A larger deal at a lower price would place more pressure on
the government to win higher prices in future offerings, the
people said today. GM and its investment banks have been
considering a deal as large as $16 billion, people familiar with
the plans said in August. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re taking a more sober view,&#8221; said Joe Phillippi,
principal of AutoTrends Inc., a consulting firm in Short Hills,
New Jersey. &#8220;The real question is what&#8217;s the price? There are
questions in people&#8217;s minds about the market and the world&#8217;s
economies.&#8221; 
Chairman Ed Whitacre, who handed CEO duties to Dan Akerson
on Sept. 1, had favored an IPO that would sell as much of the
government&#8217;s position as possible, the people said. GM&#8217;s banks
also sought a larger deal because it would generate higher fees.

Microsoft Corp. is urging an
overhaul of U.S. laws for electronic privacy to help new
services such as cloud computing, a technology that may double
sales in five years. 
As more data are stored on remote servers and away from
personal computers, a 1986 digital law needs to be updated to
give consumers confidence their information is protected, Brad Smith, Microsoft&#8217;s general counsel, said yesterday at a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington. 
&#8220;The law needs to catch up,&#8221; Smith said after the
hearing. Cloud computing is &#8220;a critical part of the future and
quite central to all that we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; 
Collecting and storing data using remote computer servers,
called cloud computing, may generate global sales of $148.8
billion by the end of 2014, up from $58.6 billion last year,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.
If consumers worry about online security, it could limit the
industry&#8217;s growth, Smith said in prepared testimony. 
Microsoft sells cloud-computing software such as
HealthVault, which helps patients manage chronic health
conditions by storing data online, and Windows Azure, which lets
a company such as Domino&#8217;s Pizza Inc. manage its orders when
demand is high, Smith said. While the U.S. Constitution shields
letters and telephone calls from government seizure, data
transferred to a third party may lack such protection.

Morgan Stanley says investors
should buy the lowest-rated corporate debt, while Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. says stay away, underscoring the dilemma faced by
investors as junk-bond prices rise to the highest since 2007. 
Bonds graded CCC in the U.S. are the &#8220;cheapest&#8221; high-
yield securities with &#8220;economic data once again beginning to
surprise to the upside,&#8221; Morgan Stanley told clients yesterday
in a report. Goldman Sachs says higher-rated speculative-grade
debt is the way to go as the economy decelerates. 
Bondholders faced with near-zero interest rates and record-
low yields are turning to higher-risk notes to boost returns,
betting growth will be strong enough to keep defaults in check.
Investors poured $480.2 billion into mutual funds that focus on
debt in the two years ended June 30, more than went into stock
funds during the Internet bubble, according to the Washington-
based Investment Company Institute. That has helped companies
sell a record amount of junk bonds in 2010 with three months
still left in the year. 
&#8220;A lot of very mediocre to marginal deals have been able
to get out of the gate over the last few months because there&#8217;s
still tremendous risk appetite,&#8221; said Margaret Patel, who
oversees about $1 billion of assets at Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s
Advantage Diversified Capital Builder Fund and Advantage
Diversified Income Builder Fund in Boston. &#8220;The economy is at
least growing slowly, but it&#8217;s growing positively, so that&#8217;s a
very, very favorable backdrop for high yield.&#8221; 
Prices Climb 
Prices of U.S. corporate bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s closed
at an average of 100.4 cents on the dollar yesterday, up from 55
cents in December 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. 
The lowest-ranked debt, rated CCC and lower, has done even
better, rising to 89.2 cents from 31.6 cents. The securities
have returned 3 percent this month, with relative yields
averaging 10.9 percentage points more than Treasuries. 
While the securities are beating BB debt by 0.94 percentage
point this month, they&#8217;re trailing for the year. The highest
tier of junk debt has gained 12.4 percent this year compared
with 10.4 percent for bonds rated CCC and lower, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. 
Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own company bonds instead of similar-maturity
government debt rose 1 basis point to 172 basis points, or 1.72
percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s
Global Broad Market Corporate Index. Yields averaged 3.476
percent, the lowest since reaching the same level Aug. 31. 
The cost of insuring Irish debt against default surged to a
record as the government auctioned bills, while Microsoft Corp.
sold bonds yesterday at the lowest interest rates on record as
September issuance continued to surge. Private equity firm KKR 
Co. issued notes for the first time. 
Microsoft Offering 
Microsoft, one of only four non-financial companies rated
AAA by SP and Moody&#8217;s, issued $4.75 billion of debentures one
day after boosting its dividend and getting board approval to
sell debt. The world&#8217;s biggest software maker, based in Redmond,
Washington, raised $1 billion from 0.875 percent three-year
debt, $1.75 billion from 1.625 percent five-year debentures, $1
billion from 3 percent notes due 2020 and $1 billion from 4.5
percent bonds maturing in 2040, Bloomberg data show. 
The coupon on the three-year security is less than the 1
percent on a similar-maturity note issued last month by
International Business Machines Corp., which was previously the
lowest of the more than 3,500 securities in the Barclays Capital
U.S. Corporate Index of investment-grade company debt. 
KKR Bonds 
KKR, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in
July, boosted its offering of 10-year senior unsecured notes to
$500 million from $350 million. The notes yield 387.5 basis
points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. 
The New York-based firm, founded by Henry Kravis and George Roberts in 1976, raised the cash as it expands beyond
traditional buyouts, in which it pools money from investors to
take over companies, and into capital markets, underwriting
equity and bond offerings. 
Credit-default swaps insuring Ireland&#8217;s sovereign debt
surged 31 basis points to an all-time high 495.5, according to
data provider CMA. 
Ireland sold 300 million euros of securities due February
2011 today at an average yield of 1.907 percent, compared with
1.925 percent at a Sept. 9 sale, according to the nation&#8217;s debt
agency. It also issued 100 million euros of April 2011
securities at an average yield of 2.231 percent, up from 2.19
percent. 
Corporate Risk 
A benchmark indicator of corporate credit risk in the U.S.
climbed for a third day. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, increased 1.6 basis points to a mid-price of
112.95 basis points as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, according to
index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting
$10 million of debt. 
Concern the U.S. economy will falter led the Federal
Reserve to say Sept. 21 it&#8217;s willing to ease monetary policy
further to spur growth. Fed policy makers said the pace of
recovery and job growth have &#8220;slowed in recent months.&#8221; The
central bank has kept its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008. 
Gross Domestic Product 
Morgan Stanley forecasts annualized growth in gross
domestic product of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the second-half
of this year. 
&#8220;That typically has been an ideal environment for
credit,&#8221; Adam Richmond, a credit strategist at Morgan Stanley
in New York, said yesterday. &#8220;Unless you really think that
we&#8217;re going to double dip, even in zero to 2 percent growth, we
find that high yield holds up OK, even the lower quality
bucket.&#8221; 
Moody&#8217;s said this week the number of U.S. companies at
greatest risk of default dropped to the lowest level in two
years. Companies rated at or below B3 with a negative outlook
declined to 195 as of Sept. 1 from a high of 288 in June 2009.
Clear Channel Communications Inc. and Energy Future Holdings
Corp., formerly named TXU Corp., were among the biggest
companies on the list. 
Goldman Sachs economists estimate growth at 1.5 percent on
an annualized basis this quarter, next quarter and in the first
period of 2011, said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist for the
firm in New York. Goldman Sachs has favored BB corporate bonds
over CCC debt since the end of 2009. 
&#8216;Deceleration&#8217; 
&#8220;We do like high yield much more in the BB and B space,&#8221;
Gallo said. &#8220;Because of the potential for deceleration in the
economy in the second half of the year, as well as relatively
compressed valuations, we prefer to be in the upper end of high
yield.&#8221; 
The average yield on CCC bonds is 12.3 percent, compared
with BB debt that pays 6.5 percent, or a spread over Treasuries
of 465 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. 
&#8220;Lower-quality high yield to us is cheaper on a risk-
adjusted valuation than higher-quality high yield,&#8221; Richmond
said. &#8220;Over the next year or so, the right trade is to be long
credit risk and short or neutral on rate risk. The best way to
get the most credit exposure with the least rate exposure is in
lower-quality high yield.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley estimates the 10-year Treasury note yield
will rise to 3 percent this year and to 4.25 percent by the end
of 2011, while Goldman Sachs forecasts 2.5 percent in December
2010 and 3.3 percent a year later. The yield closed at 2.56
percent yesterday in New York. 
Sales Booming 
Junk bond sales are booming. Speculative-grade debt
issuance in the U.S. jumped to $187.3 billion this year compared
with $100.1 billion in the same period of 2009, Bloomberg data
show. Companies rated Caa1 or lower by Moody&#8217;s have issued at
least $2.63 billion of bonds this month, compared with $2.56
billion in August and the most since April. 
Goldman Sachs has underwritten 84 issues totaling $12.95
billion of high-yield U.S. offerings this year, 6.9 percent of
the market and the sixth-highest amount, Bloomberg data show.
Morgan Stanley is seventh, having helped manage 81 offerings for
$12.7 billion of sales, or 6.8 percent of the market. 
The firms helped underwrite Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International&#8217;s two-part, $1.2 billion sale of senior notes on
Sept. 21, Bloomberg data show. 
Demand for the lowest debt is evident with Freescale
Semiconductor Inc., bought in a 2006 leveraged buyout led by
Blackstone Group LP, selling $750 million of notes yesterday
after increasing the size of the offering from $500 million. The
10-year, 10.75 percent debentures are rated Caa2 by Moody&#8217;s and
the equivalent CCC by SP. The Austin, Texas-based chipmaker&#8217;s
$1.265 billion of 8.875 percent notes due 2014 rose 2.94 cents
to 100 cents on the dollar, Trace data show.

Johnson Controls Inc., which is
involved in more than 500 renewable-energy projects worldwide,
expects &#8220;exponential&#8221; growth in India&#8217;s low-carbon market as
companies plan investments to cut energy costs. 
Indian companies are planning on average to spend 12
percent of their budgets on energy-efficiency investments in the
next year, Pramoda Karkal, managing director of Johnson
Controls&#8217;s India unit, said today, citing an April survey
conducted by the Milwaukee-based company. 
&#8220;This is creating a market for such projects,&#8221; Karkal
said by telephone from New Delhi. &#8220;It&#8217;s likely to grow at an
absolutely exponential curve.&#8221; 
Indian companies expect energy costs to rise 17 percent
this year and are prioritizing such investments more than
counterparts in nine other countries surveyed, including the
U.S., Germany and China, the poll of 311 companies found. 
India plans to start a market for trading energy-efficiency
credits that is expected to grow to $16 billion in five years,
Ajay Mathur, director-general of the Bureau of Energy
Efficiency, said in an interview on Jan. 14. The number of
energy-service companies in India, which audit consumption and
help to reduce it, has more than doubled this year to 80, the
bureau said last month.

Repsol YPF SA&#8217;s planned sale of
shares in its Brazilian unit is a &#8220;positive trigger&#8221; for the
valuation of Spain&#8217;s biggest oil company, JPMorgan said. 
&#8220;It will help to realize a fuller valuation for its pre-
salt discoveries,&#8221; London-based analysts Fred Lucas and Nitin Sharma wrote today in a note. &#8220;Concerns on potential demand
weakness in the local market are overdone. We believe that the
company&#8217;s good exploration track record, pure upstream bias and
well appraised resource base ought to be an attractive
preposition for investors.&#8221; 
Repsol, which plans to sell about 40 percent of its
Brazilian business through an initial public offering, filed to
sell voting shares in the unit on Aug. 9. The Madrid-based
company is seeking to raise about $4 billion from the stock
sale, valuing the unit at about $10 billion, two people familiar
with the plan said in July. 
The JPMorgan analysts have an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on
Repsol and increased the share-price estimate to 23 euros from
21 euros. The shares have advanced 0.4 percent in Madrid so far
this year, giving Repsol a market value of 23 billion euros ($31
billion). 
Repsol has stakes in blocks in Brazil&#8217;s Santos, Campos and
Espirito Santo basins, and will invest as much as $5 billion
there from 2010 through 2014, and as much as $9 billion from
2015 through 2019. 
Since 2007, Repsol and partners BG Group Plc and Brazil&#8217;s
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA have found hydrocarbons
in the offshore Carioca, Guara and Iguacu fields in the Santos
Basin&#8217;s BM-S-9 block. These are ultra-deep deposits beneath a
salt layer under the seabed. 
Petrobras, as Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil company is
known, estimated in November 2007 that the Santos Basin&#8217;s pre-
salt Tupi field may contain as many as 8 billion barrels of oil,
the largest find in the Americas since Mexico&#8217;s Cantarell field
in 1976. Repsol doesn&#8217;t own a stake in Tupi.

General Growth Properties Inc. said
it expects to pursue a stock offering after it emerges from
bankruptcy to replace financing commitments from some investors
instead of selling notes that would convert to equity. 
The company, the second-largest U.S. mall owner, is
planning a post-bankruptcy offering that would replace &#8220;a
substantial portion&#8221; of the shares slated to be issued to an
investor group, it said in a filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. 
General Growth, based in Chicago, is approaching the end of
its bankruptcy case, which started in April 2009. It&#8217;s scheduled
to seek court approval next month for its plan to exit
bankruptcy with financing commitments from Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management LLC and Pershing
Square Capital Management LP. 
General Growth has the right to replace portions of the
investors&#8217; equity commitments through a public offering of notes
that convert to shares or through a post-bankruptcy public stock
offering, according to court papers. 
General Growth has an underwriting agreement from Goldman 
Sachs Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo Securities, RBC Capital
Markets Corp., Barclays PLC, UBS Securities LLC, Macquarie Bank
Ltd. and TD Securities (USA) LLC. 
General Growth also has exit-financing commitments of as
much as $1.8 billion in loans, according to the court filing. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

The Chicago mansion owned by Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase 
Co., went under contract for an undisclosed amount after the
price was cut by about $2.6 million. 
A sales agreement for the Gold Coast neighborhood home is
pending, Janet Owen, the listing agent at Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s
International Realty, said in an e-mail yesterday. She declined
to comment further. The property was taken off the market and
put under contract on Sept. 21, according to a local multiple
listing service report. 
The eight-bedroom property was listed at $6.95 million by
Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s, after having an asking price of $9.5 million
earlier this year. It was previously advertised at $10.5 million
by Koenig  Strey GMAC Real Estate. 
Dimon and his wife, Judith, bought the house in 2000 for
$4.7 million, according to records on the website of the Cook
County Recorder of Deeds. The mansion, which has nine full
bathrooms, was built in the late 1800s and is near Lake Michigan
and Oak Street Beach. Dimon first listed it for sale in April
2007 for $13.5 million. 
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. 
The contract was reported yesterday by Crain&#8217;s Chicago

Walt Disney Co. said Steve Wadsworth will step down as president of the company&#8217;s
Interactive Media Group. 
A replacement will be named shortly, the Burbank,
California-based company said in a statement. In an e-mail to
employees last night, Wadsworth said he&#8217;ll remain through a
transition after Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
picks his successor. 
Wadsworth, a 17-year veteran, becomes the sixth Disney
division head to leave his job this year. That includes Chief
Financial Officer Tom Staggs and Parks chief Jay Rasulo swapping
roles. John Pleasants, CEO of Playdom, the social games company
Disney bought in July, is the leading candidate for Wadsworth&#8217;s
job, the New York Times reported yesterday, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter. 
&#8220;There are a number of career adventures and new endeavors
that I have been interested in exploring, but my commitment and
focus have been here at Disney,&#8221; Wadsworth wrote in the e-mail.
&#8220;While there is never a good time to leave a great role at a
great company, for many reasons now is the right time for me to
move on.&#8221; 
Courtney Simmons, a spokeswoman for Disney&#8217;s Interactive
division, said Wadsworth was unavailable to comment further. 
Big media companies typically lose money online. Disney&#8217;s
interactive group lost $65 million last quarter, while News
Corp.&#8217;s digital media unit lost $174 million in the quarter
ended in June. CBS Corp. stopped reporting interactive results
after it lost $41.3 million in the first nine months of 2009. 
Acquisitions 
Wadsworth has run Disney&#8217;s Interactive group since 1999 and
assumed oversight of video-game operations in 2008. Since paying
$350 million for the kids&#8217; social network Club Penguin three
years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games, whose founder
helped create Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s hit &#8220;Halo&#8221; franchise. And in
July, Disney acquired Tapulous, a publisher of music-related
games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone. 
&#8220;I am confident that the business is well positioned for
continued significant growth,&#8221; Wadsworth wrote. &#8220;Our recent
re-organization and acquisitions have put in place all of the
elements needed to build a large, high growth, profitable
business across multiple interactive media categories.&#8221; 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, rose 45 cents to
$33.57 at 2:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, it had gained 2.7 percent this year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. listed Ford
Motor Co. and Southwest Airlines Co. as among 24 low-priced
cyclical stocks that may lure investors by year-end. 
Improved 2011 earnings estimates and attractive valuations
may help cyclical companies, which are more sensitive to
economic growth, outperform versus so-called defensive stocks,
according to Thomas Lee, the firm&#8217;s chief U.S. equity
strategist. Stocks priced below $22 a share have trailed gains
by the broader equity markets and may begin to rally in the next
three months, he said. 
&#8220;There is a strong and intuitive relationship between
economic momentum and cyclical outperformance,&#8221; Lee wrote in a
research note today. &#8220;The improved tone of equity markets in
recent weeks is notable.&#8221; 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has climbed 7.2 percent in
September through yesterday as improved economic data has
bolstered optimism in the economic recovery. The benchmark for
U.S. equities was still 7.6 percent below this year&#8217;s high in
April, after falling on concern that American unemployment and
widening budget deficits in Europe would derail global growth. 
US Airways Group Inc., CBS Corp. and Macy&#8217;s Inc. are among
the companies with the highest market capitalizations listed in
the group. Lee selected the 24 cyclical, high-beta companies
with 2011 earnings forecasts that have been raised by analysts
since April, shares priced less than $22 and market
capitalization greater than $1 billion. 
High-beta stocks move the most relative to benchmark
indexes. 
The SP 500&#8217;s rally may continue based on the index&#8217;s
performance in midterm election years, according to Lee.
Equities have risen from mid-September to year-end in 21 of the
past 28 midterm election years. Lee&#8217;s forecast for where the SP
500 will be at the end of the year is 1,300, the highest of the
11 strategists who gave an estimate in a survey by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;History strongly favors equities to outperform in the
fourth quarter,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Given the mixed performance of
many asset managers year-to-date, this suggests we should see
performance chasing this year.&#8221;

     Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy closely held Blade Network Technologies Inc. to gain
products that connect server computers in company data centers. 
IBM didn&#8217;t give a value for the purchase in its statement
today. Santa Clara, California-based Blade Network&#8217;s investors
include Garnett  Helfrich Capital and Juniper Networks Inc. 
IBM is bolstering data-center offerings as rivals expand in
corporate computing. Blade Network makes switches that connect
servers, storage and networks in data centers, large rooms of
computers that handle corporate tasks. It&#8217;s the third
acquisition IBM has announced this month, after a $1.7 billion
deal for storage-analytics maker Netezza Corp. and a purchase of
software maker OpenPages Inc. for an undisclosed sum. 
The move may help IBM compete as rivals increasingly tie
networking gear with data centers. Cisco Systems Inc., the
world&#8217;s largest maker of networking equipment, last year
released its first blade servers, pushing into the data-center
market and pitting it against Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM. In
April, HP bought 3Com Corp. for $2.7 billion to bolster its
data-center networking. 
Sam Palmisano, IBM&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in May
he is planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the
next five years. He&#8217;s made more than 100 purchases since taking
over the company eight years ago. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, gained 54 cents to $134.65
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have added 2.9 percent this year. 
Oracle Corp., the world&#8217;s second-largest software maker,
bought server-maker Sun Microsystems Inc. for more than $7
billion in January. This month, HP agreed to pay $2.35 billion
for data-storage maker 3Par Inc., after a bidding contest with
Dell Inc.

Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, sued Danish competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K.
court to invalidate its patent for an injection mechanism that
prevents overdoses. 
Novo Nordisk&#8217;s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren&#8217;t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn&#8217;t say if Pfizer is using the technology. 
&#8220;We disagree with Pfizer&#8217;s claim and we will defend the
patent in court,&#8221; Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said today in a phone interview. 
Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. 
Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement. 
Novo Nordisk in December started the first human tests on
an experimental insulin pill, joining companies seeking to
develop an alternative to daily injections. 
The companies&#8217; earlier dispute concerned Pfizer&#8217;s inhaled-
insulin product Exubera, seen as a possible replacement to
injections. Pfizer stopped selling the product in 2007 when it
failed to catch on with doctors and patients, while Novo Nordisk
abandoned its inhaled version the following year. 
The companies in 2007 settled a U.S. patent-infringement
suit over Exubera. In that case, Novo Nordisk sued Pfizer in
federal court in New York, claiming Exubera infringed two
patents.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said there&#8217;s a
75 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will start another
round of asset purchases before the end of this year to boost
the economy, supporting Treasury bond prices. 
The U.S. central bank may spend &#8220;a few hundred billion
dollars&#8221; on a so-called quantitative easing program, and it&#8217;s
likely to keep the official rate on hold until 2012, said Pavan Wadhwa, head of European interest-rate strategy in London at
JPMorgan. 
&#8220;The Fed is likely to do more quantitative easing, and
that will pull Treasury yields lower,&#8221; Wadhwa said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to argue that these bonds are overvalued
when inflation and resource utilisation rates remain very low,
and the unemployment rate is high.&#8221; 
The Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s Sept. 21 statement said
it &#8220;will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial
developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation
if needed to support the economic recovery.&#8221; 
The Fed&#8217;s statement indicates it&#8217;s focused on an inflation
level below the preferred long-term range as the main reason to
provide additional stimulus. Consumer prices excluding food and
fuel costs rose 0.9 percent in August from a year earlier,
matching the smallest increase since the 1960s. 
The Fed retained its policy, begun last month, of
reinvesting proceeds from mortgage debt repayments into long-
term Treasuries. It has bought $34 billion since it began the
program on Aug. 17. Policy makers also kept the benchmark
federal funds rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where
it&#8217;s been since December 2008, and reiterated the rate will stay
&#8220;exceptionally low&#8221; for an &#8220;extended period.&#8221; 
Japanese Intervention 
Other factors that may also push Treasury yields lower
include the consequences of intervention in the currency market
by the Bank of Japan, said Wadhwa. Earlier this month, Japan
intervened in the foreign-exchange market for the first time
since 2004 after the yen&#8217;s advance to a 15-year high against the
dollar threatened to stunt the nation&#8217;s economic recovery. 
&#8220;The Bank of Japan bought a significant amount of dollars
during the forex intervention, and may do another round,&#8221; said
Wadhwa. &#8220;They will need to invest these dollars somewhere. I
suspect they will end up investing in Treasuries.&#8221; 
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury declined 4 basis
points to 2.56 percent as of 11:45 a.m. in London. The two-year
note yield was down 2 basis points to 0.43 percent.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. faces a legal
challenge next month that could cast doubt on thousands of
foreclosures after a mortgage executive at the bank said she
didn&#8217;t verify documents used to justify home seizures. 
Lawyers for a Palm Beach County, Florida, homeowner asked a
judge to throw out a foreclosure as a penalty for misleading the
court, according to attorney Tom Ice of Ice Legal PA. They&#8217;re
citing a May 17 deposition in which the JPMorgan executive said
she signed thousands of affidavits and documents supporting the
New York-based bank&#8217;s claims without personally checking loan
records. The court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 19. 
The Chase Home Finance operation supervisor, Beth Ann
Cottrell, said in May she was among eight managers who together
sign about 18,000 documents a month, according to a transcript
of her sworn deposition provided by Ice. Asked how they were
prepared, she said she relied on other people at the firm. 
&#8220;My review is more or less signing the document unless
it&#8217;s questionable,&#8221; she said. That means, &#8220;somebody has a
question and brings it to me and says, &#8216;Beth, can you take a
look at this?&#8217;&#8221; 
Inaccurate statements by banks in foreclosure documents may
give borrowers who have lost their homes a legal basis to
challenge the seizures, derailing resales and casting doubts on
property titles. A Florida court sanctioned Ally Financial
Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage unit for faulty affidavits in 2006, and the
firm suspended evictions in 23 states this month after finding
employees still signing affidavits without checking the data. 
Titles in Doubt 
JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined requests for comment.
Cottrell didn&#8217;t return phone calls to her office requesting
comment. A lawyer representing her at the deposition, Joseph
Mancilla of the Florida Default Law Group PL, didn&#8217;t return
calls. Cottrell isn&#8217;t named as a defendant. 
Cottrell signed the affidavit at issue in the case, dated
June 2009, while at her previous employer, an outside servicing
firm working for JPMorgan, according to court documents. When
signing documents there for the JPMorgan unit, she used the
title &#8220;assistant secretary and vice president&#8221; of Chase Home
Finance, according to the transcript. She became a JPMorgan
employee about three months after signing the affidavit.
Document signers sometimes endorse affidavits on behalf of other
firms as a way to streamline the foreclosure process, said
Dustin Zacks, an attorney at Ice&#8217;s firm. 
JPMorgan was the third-largest U.S. servicer of home
mortgages as of June 30, with $1.35 trillion or almost 13
percent of the market, according to industry newsletter Inside
Mortgage Finance. Ally is the fifth-biggest mortgage servicer,
with $349.1 billion. The other three in the top five are Bank of
America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co., and Citigroup Inc. 
Foreclosures Averted 
Servicers perform billing and collections on home loans.
When borrowers default, the firms handle the foreclosure
process. Affidavits lay the legal foundation for a foreclosure
by attesting that the borrower is delinquent and that the lender
is entitled to seize the home. Details of the JPMorgan case were
reported earlier last week by the Financial Times. 
Lawyers in Florida and New York, among other states, have
halted foreclosures and evictions by showing affidavits were
faulty. Attorneys general in Texas, Iowa and Illinois have
started investigations into mortgage practices at GMAC Mortgage
following last week&#8217;s revelations. California has ordered the
company to prove its foreclosures are legal or halt them. 
If the documents are shown to be false after a home has
already been resold by a bank, that casts doubt on who is the
rightful owner, said O. Max Gardner III, an attorney at law firm
Gardner  Gardner PLLC in Shelby, North Carolina, who has
represented homeowners in fighting foreclosures and has cases
pending against JPMorgan. 
Title Insurers 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure a lot of title insurance companies are concerned
about the potential liability right now,&#8221; as borrowers
challenge how banks made statements, he said. &#8220;The judges could
absolutely hold the bank and attorneys in contempt.&#8221; 
U.S. home seizures reached a record for the third time in
five months in August as lenders completed the foreclosure
process for thousands of delinquent owners, according to
RealtyTrac Inc. 
Ice, the founding partner of his foreclosure-defense law
firm in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, said some lenders are
accepting voluntary dismissal of their cases. 
During the deposition, Cottrell said a staff of in-house
specialists scrutinize loan documents and prepare affidavits,
the transcript shows. If they have difficulties or questions,
they come to her. She signs in a notary&#8217;s presence, she said. 
&#8216;No Knowledge&#8217; 
During questioning by Ice lawyer Zacks, Cottrell said she
had worked at Chase Home Finance for about eight months,
according to the transcript. 
&#8220;As to everything in the affidavit, did you have personal
knowledge?&#8221; Zacks asked. 
&#8220;My own personal knowledge, no,&#8221; Cottrell answered. 
&#8220;You stated &#8216;That plaintiff is entitled to enforce the
note and mortgage,&#8217;&#8221; Zacks said. &#8220;Again, did you have personal
knowledge of that?&#8221; 
&#8220;No knowledge,&#8221; she answered. 
Florida Attorney General William McCollum is investigating
three law firms that represent loan servicers in foreclosures,
and are alleged to have submitted fraudulent documents to the
courts, according to an Aug. 10 statement. The firms handled
about 80 percent of foreclosure cases in the state, according to
a letter from U.S. Representative Alan Grayson, a Florida
Democrat. 
Judges overseeing foreclosures in the wake of the housing
crisis are growing skeptical of banks, said Christopher L. Peterson, a professor at the University of Utah&#8217;s S.J. Quinney
College of Law. A surge in proceedings has helped expose a
variety of paperwork lapses, he said in an interview. 
&#8220;Early in the process the judges were very cavalier and
they just took the financiers&#8217; word,&#8221; Peterson said. &#8220;Now
there are enough disputes out there about ownership of loans
that the judges are starting to feel like they need to hold the
financial institutions to the basic rules of evidence.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to
triple private banking assets in Asia, its fastest-growing
market, over the next five years after moving one of its top
executives to the region. 
The unit, which manages money for wealthy clients and
employs 400 people in Asia, intends to increase its number of
client advisors in the region by 40 percent this year and next,
after growing at a similar pace in 2009, Douglas Wurth, chief
executive officer for international private banking at New York-
based JPMorgan, said in an interview. 
JPMorgan aims to generate about half of its non-U.S.
business from Asia, up from the current 20 percent, according to
Wurth, who moved to Hong Kong in February from New York. Rivals
including UBS AG are also expanding in the region, where assets
of millionaires grew 31 percent in 2009, according to a June
report by Capgemini SA and Bank of America Corp. 
&#8220;However excited one can be about the opportunities when
you&#8217;re in New York, that only magnifies ten-fold once you&#8217;re
here in Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Jakarta,&#8221; Wurth said in
Singapore yesterday. &#8220;You just see up close and personal the
dynamic changes taking place.&#8221; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s expansion comes after the number of millionaires
in the Asia-Pacific region reached 3 million in 2009, matching
those in Europe for the first time, according to the report by
Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit and Capgemini. The
millionaires&#8217; assets rose 31 percent to $9.7 trillion, it said.

Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ABC, CBS Corp.
and other broadcasters sued Ivi, an online subscription service,
for streaming television programs over the Web without
authorization. 
The companies, also including News Corp.&#8217;s Fox, General
Electric Co.&#8217;s NBC and the Public Broadcasting Service, today
accused Ivi and its founder Todd Weaver of copyright
infringement in a federal court complaint in New York. 
&#8220;Defendants have launched their infringing Internet TV
service to coincide with the start of the new fall television
season,&#8221; the broadcasters said in the complaint. 
Ivi, based in Seattle, began streaming TV stations there
and in New York 24 hours a day to Web subscribers worldwide on
Sept. 13, according to the lawsuit. Viewers would pay $4.99 a
month after a 30-day free trial, the complaint said.
Broadcasters have deals with companies including Hulu LLC,
Netflix Inc. and Apple Inc. to stream TV shows. Hulu&#8217;s owners
include NBC, Fox and ABC. 
On Sept. 20, Ivi and Weaver filed suit in federal court in
Seattle seeking a ruling that Ivi isn&#8217;t infringing copyrights. 
&#8220;Big media is choosing to fight Internet delivery the same
way they fought against cable delivery and satellite delivery,
when in reality it is legal to retransmit,&#8221; Weaver said in an
e-mail today. 
&#8216;Big Media&#8217; 
&#8220;Broadcasters charge more in advertising due to the
increase in viewers,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;It is too bad big media
must fight innovation that is legal, pays them and increases
their revenue.&#8221; 
The broadcasters said that after they demanded that Ivi
stop streaming their stations, the company initially responded
that it was &#8220;open to engaging in discussions to explore more
direct contractual agreements with certain plaintiffs.&#8221; Ivi
sued several days later. 
Major League Baseball, Univision, Telemundo, Cox Media,
Tribune Television, Fisher Broadcasting, WPIX, WGBH and WNET.org
are also plaintiffs in the New York suit. 
Today&#8217;s case is WPIX Inc. v. Ivi Inc., 10-7415, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
earlier case is Ivi Inc. v. Fisher Communications Inc., 10-1512,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).

(Corrects to say deal is sold in headline, first
paragraph.) 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $14.5
million of so-called range accrual notes linked to interbank
lending rates and the yen, which reached a 15-year high versus
the dollar this month. 
The sale includes a $9.5 million portion with a 15-year
maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the first
five years, the notes pay an annualized return of 8.5 percent
each day the six-month London interbank offered rate is below
6.5 percent and the dollar is worth more than 80 yen. After five
years, the Libor limit increases to 7 percent. 
Goldman Sachs also sold $5 million of 12-year notes that
pay a coupon of 7.2 percent if three-month Libor stays below 6.5
percent and the dollar is above 78 yen. 
Both notes don&#8217;t pay any interest if Libor or the dollar
moves outside the notes&#8217; ranges. The securities were issued at
100 percent of face value. 
The yen rose 0.25 percent to 84.08 per dollar at 12:26 p.m.
in London. The Japanese currency strengthened to 82.88 on Sept.
15, its highest level against the dollar since May 1995. 
Six-month Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks and
used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.463 percent, the lowest
since April 19. The rate was last above 6.5 percent in December
2000.

Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s
largest media company, introduced a new publication, DYOU, as it
taps the magazine market for pre-teen girls worldwide. 
The monthly is scheduled to go on sale in Italy tomorrow at
1.90 euros ($2.58) and to roll out in 30 countries including the
U.S. in 2011, Carlotta Saltini, chief marketing officer of Walt
Disney Co. Italia, said at a presentation in Milan today. DYOU,
whose D stands for Disney, features pop singer Avril Lavigne on
its first cover, as it expands beyond Disney&#8217;s stable of
celebrities such as Miley Cyrus. 
&#8220;DYOU will have an international reach, but it comes from
Disney&#8217;s creative forge in Italy,&#8221; Saltini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s our
first international magazine aimed at girls aged 10 to 13. It&#8217;s
an ambitious project.&#8221; 
Disney Publishing Worldwide is the largest publisher of
children&#8217;s books and magazines globally, reaching more than 100
million readers a month in 75 countries, according to the
company&#8217;s website. &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; and &#8220;High School
Musical&#8221; are among its magazines for teens. 
DYOU was created in Milan, one of the company&#8217;s centers for
magazine development, Jeanne M. Mosure, Disney Publishing senior
vice president, said in an interview after the presentation. 
&#8220;Italy is an important market for us and was key to the
initial launch of DYOU,&#8221; Mosure said. &#8220;Internationally, we
look forward strategically to our 30-country rollout --
including the U.S. -- in 2011.&#8221;

Among the other companies registered to bid are Eni Spa,
Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Abdul Hadi
al-Hassani, vice chairman of the parliament&#8217;s oil and gas
committee, said in an interview in Istanbul today. The bidding
round for gas rights is planned for Oct. 20 in Baghdad. 
&#8220;There is strong interest from the big majors, and this is
excellent,&#8221; Hassani said. &#8220;We care more about the fact that
big majors are interested, rather than in the number of
bidders.&#8221; 
Preparations for bidding are proceeding well and according
to schedule, he said on the sidelines of a conference about
Iraq&#8217;s energy industry. 
Iraq, reliant on oil for most of its income, seeks foreign
investors in all parts of its economy after years of conflict
and sanctions. The country held two licensing rounds last year
for oil and gas investments. 
The third round will focus specifically on the Akkas,
Mansouriya and Siba gas fields, which Iraq is eager to develop
for domestic power generation as well as export revenue. The
three undeveloped fields hold combined gas reserves of more than
11 trillion cubic feet. 
Iraq has the world&#8217;s fourth-largest oil reserves and wants
to more than double its current crude production of 2.4 million
barrels a day.

Oracle Corp. sued Micron Technology
Inc., alleging it overcharged Sun Microsystems Inc., which
Oracle acquired, by conspiring to fix prices for computer memory
chips. 
Micron and other makers of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, artificially inflated the price of chips they sold to Sun,
Oracle claimed in an antitrust complaint filed Sept. 24 in
federal court in San Jose, California. 
The case is partly based on a 2002 U.S. Justice Department
investigation of price fixing in the memory-chip industry that
led to claims against four companies and 16 people who have been
fined as much as $731 million. Micron cooperated with U.S.
officials in exchange for not being charged with a crime,
according to Oracle&#8217;s complaint. 
The memory manufacturers &#8220;conspired to control production
capacity, raise prices or slow their decline, allocate
customers, and otherwise unlawfully overcharge their DRAM
customers,&#8221; Oracle said in its complaint. 
Dan Francisco, a spokesman for Boise, Idaho-based Micron,
declined to comment. 
Ichon, South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Suwon,
South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co., Tokyo-based Elpida
Memory Inc. and Neubiberg, Germany-based Infineon Technologies
AG are indentified by Oracle as co-conspirators in the case.
Those companies aren&#8217;t named as defendants.

JPMorgan Based Home Foreclosures on Faulty Court Documents 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. faces a legal challenge next month
that could cast doubt on thousands of foreclosures after a
mortgage executive at the bank said she didn&#8217;t verify documents
used to justify home seizures. 
Lawyers for a Palm Beach County, Florida, homeowner asked a

Potash Corp. Can Examine BHP Evidence U.S. Judge Says 
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. is entitled to
documentary evidence requested from BHP Billiton Ltd. in a
lawsuit in which the Canadian fertilizer company seeks to block
a $40 billion hostile takeover offer. 
&#8220;Unless BHP is prepared to extend the tender date, I&#8217;m not
going to stay discovery,&#8221; U.S. District Judge David H. Coar in
Chicago told lawyers for both sides yesterday. BHP set a Nov. 18
deadline for Potash stockholders to accept its $130-a-share
offer. 
The world&#8217;s largest fertilizer maker, Saskatoon-based
Potash sued BHP on Sept. 22, alleging that the company&#8217;s
executives made misleading public statements to drive down its
share value, increasing the likelihood of a successful bid. 
Potash asked Coar for an order barring Melbourne-based BHP
from taking further steps to acquire its shares. It also asked
the judge to direct BHP to issue a &#8220;corrective disclosure&#8221;
statement, and to give Potash shareholders 60 days to consider
it. 
Coar yesterday scheduled a hearing on the injunction
request for Nov. 4. 
BHP, in a Sept. 24 court filing, called Potash&#8217;s demand
that it hand over large quantities of documents burdensome and a
&#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; and said the company waited too long to
make the request. 
The company said Coar should deny the discovery demand
until he rules on a dismissal request the Australian company has
not yet submitted. 
Coar yesterday told BHP attorney Michele Odorizzi that he
won&#8217;t set any dates concerning a dismissal motion until one is
actually filed. 
He said the Potash evidence demand was overly broad and
that BHP would not be required to produce documentation until
the scope of that demand had been narrowed either by mutual
agreement or the direction of a federal magistrate judge. 
&#8220;We are pleased that the court has scheduled a hearing on
Nov. 4, well in advance of the Nov. 18 scheduled expiration of
our offer,&#8221; BHP said in an e-mailed press statement after
yesterday&#8217;s court appearance. &#8220;We believe the case is without
merit and we intend to contest it vigorously, including by
filing a motion to dismiss later this week.&#8221; 
Potash declined to comment on the court&#8217;s ruling. 
The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). 
BP&#8217;s Probation Over Fatal Texas Blast Won&#8217;t Be Revoked by U.S. 
BP Plc&#8217;s probation for violating a plea deal that resolved
the company&#8217;s criminal liability for a fatal 2005 explosion at
its Texas City, Texas, refinery won&#8217;t be revoked by the U.S.
Justice Department. 
After consulting with BP, regulators and blast victims,
prosecutors said they would give the company 18 more months to
complete required safety reviews and upgrades at the Texas
refinery, according to documents filed in federal court in
Houston. 
&#8220;The Department of Justice is not seeking a revocation or
extension of probation at this time,&#8221; Daniel Dooher, a senior
trial attorney in the U.S. environmental crimes division, said
in a Sept. 8 letter to U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal. Dooher
said safety regulators and &#8220;BP have executed a stipulation and
agreement resolving the allegations of non-compliance,&#8221; which
includes an extension of BP&#8217;s deadline to complete the work
until March 12, 2012, the date its probation will expire. 
BP Products North America, a unit of the London-based
company, agreed in March 2009 to pay a $50 million fine and
complete three years probation for violating U.S. air pollution
laws linked to the March 2005 explosion that killed 15 and
injured thousands. 
BP&#8217;s plea deal required it to complete a review of
pressure-relief valves throughout its largest U.S. refinery and
complete installation of automated safety instrumentation, as
required by the company&#8217;s settlement with the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration. 
Brent Coon, the lead lawyer for victims of the explosion,
called the government&#8217;s decision &#8220;disappointing but not
surprising.&#8221; He said yesterday in an e-mail that prosecutors
had told him they &#8220;don&#8217;t want to reopen the case unless
negotiations with OSHA collapse.&#8221; 
Daren Beaudo, a BP spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call and e-
mail seeking comment yesterday after regular business hours. 
The 2005 explosion occurred when an octane-boosting unit
overflowed as it was being restarted, igniting a blast that
shattered windows five miles away. The U.S. Chemical Safety
Board found numerous safety lapses that rendered the plant &#8220;a
catastrophe waiting to happen,&#8221; according to John Bresland, the
board&#8217;s chairman. 
The case is U.S. v. BP Products North America, 4:07-cr-
00434, U.S. District Courts, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). 
Kerimov&#8217;s Assets Are Frozen in Second Court Order 
A Cyprus court extended a freeze on Russian billionaire
Suleiman Kerimov&#8217;s assets, including stakes in mining company
OAO Polyus Gold and fertilizer maker OAO Uralkali. 
The case, reviewed yesterday, will be heard again on Nov.
17, Nicosia District Court President Michalis Christodoulou said
at the court. A Sept. 17 order already banned Cyprus-registered
entities controlled by Kerimov from any transactions using
shares in Uralkali and Polyus. 
The move follows a complaint against Kerimov by Ashot
Egiazaryan, a member of Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament, who
claims Kerimov forced him to relinquish 25.5 percent of the
Moskva hotel near Moscow&#8217;s Red Square. Egiazaryan filed a
request for $2 billion in damages at the London Court of
International Arbitration on Sept. 13, according to court
documents in Cyprus. 
A lawyer for Kerimov, Michael Stepek at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP in Geneva, would only say he was aware of the
Cypriot injunction. 
Soteris Flourentzos and George Triantafyllides, lawyers who
represent five of Kerimov&#8217;s companies affected by the
injunction, had appealed against the Sept. 17 order. 
Those five companies have been officially notified of the
court&#8217;s latest ruling, Andreas Chaviaras, Egiazaryan&#8217;s lawyer,
said yesterday. &#8220;We have indications that also the remaining
companies have been notified,&#8221; he said. 
Kerimov, ranked by Finans magazine as Russia&#8217;s fourth-
richest man with a fortune of $14.5 billion, owns 37 percent of
Polyus, according to a July 2009 company filing, and 25 percent
of Uralkali. The stakes, of which part are pledged for bank
loans, are worth $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively,
Bloomberg calculations show.

Legal Reviews 
Bar to GMAC/Ally Foreclosures Sought by Connecticut 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office is investigating defective foreclosure documents filed by
GMAC/Ally Finance Inc. and demanding that the company freeze
foreclosures in the state. 
&#8220;The GMAC/Ally foreclosure steamroller should be stopped
so the company can be held accountable,&#8221; Blumenthal said
yesterday in a statement. &#8220;My office has already confirmed that
some defective documents were filed in Connecticut.&#8221; 
Blumenthal&#8217;s action follows news of investigations by
Texas, Iowa and Illinois into mortgage practices at Ally.
California ordered the company to stop foreclosures until it can
prove it is complying with state law. 
Ally, the Detroit-based auto and home lender, faces claims
that its GMAC unit evicted people from their homes without first
ensuring that the borrowers were in default or the firm had
legal standing to take possession of the homes. 
GMAC Mortgage on Sept. 17 notified agents and brokers that
it was suspending evictions in 23 states. 
New Suits 
Pfizer Sues Novo Nordisk Over Insulin-Device Patent 
Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, sued Danish
competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K. court to invalidate its
patent for an injection mechanism that prevents overdoses. 
Novo Nordisk&#8217;s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren&#8217;t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn&#8217;t say if Pfizer is using the technology. 
&#8220;We disagree with Pfizer&#8217;s claim and we will defend the
patent in court,&#8221; Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said yesterday in a phone interview. 
Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. 
Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement.

Trials/Appeals 
India Court Tells Authorities to Fix Vodafone Taxes 
India&#8217;s Supreme Court gave the tax department four weeks to
fix the amount it&#8217;s claiming from Vodafone Group Plc on the
company&#8217;s purchase of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.&#8217;s wireless assets
in the country. 
A three-judge bench of India&#8217;s highest court headed by
Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia yesterday set Oct. 25 as the date for
its next hearing on an appeal by Vodafone of a lower court
ruling that upheld authorities&#8217; right to claim the taxes. The
company may need to pay a part of the liability, estimated at
more than 120 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) including interest,
pending disposal of the case, the court indicated. 
The Newbury, England-based company is appealing against the
Sept. 8 verdict of the Bombay High Court, which ruled
authorities have the jurisdiction to seek taxes from Vodafone
International Holdings BV on its 2007 purchase of Hutchison&#8217;s
Indian wireless operations. 
&#8220;The Supreme Court will now give a final take on the
Vodafone matter,&#8221; Hitesh Jain, a partner at Mumbai-based law
firm ALMT Legal, said by telephone. &#8220;It&#8217;s also one more forum
for Vodafone to debate the issue, to explain their position, so
it&#8217;s a positive development for the company.&#8221; 
The carrier &#8220;firmly&#8221; believes its acquisition isn&#8217;t
liable for tax in India, Vodafone said in an e-mail. The
transaction was between Netherlands-based Vodafone International
and Hong Kong-based Hutchison and the stake Vodafone acquired
was owned by a Cayman Islands-based holding company. 
U.S. Urges Stem-Cell Funding Stay by Appeals Court 
The U.S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court
to maintain its stay on a lower-court order cutting off funds
for embryonic stem cell research while it seeks to overturn the
trial judge&#8217;s ruling. 
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, after an hour-long hearing, didn&#8217;t say
when it would decide whether to make the emergency hold extend
through the appeal. The Obama administration attorneys argued
that even a temporary cutoff would cause irreparable harm to
researchers, taxpayers and scientific progress. 
The appeals court ruled on Sept. 9 that the government can
keep funds flowing for the research at least during the initial
stages of the administration&#8217;s challenge to the order banning
taxpayer support for any activity using cells taken from human
embryos. 
U.S. Judge Royce Lamberth last month cited the still-in-
force 1996 Dickey-Wicker Amendment in his ruling, saying
Congress prohibited funding any research in which a human embryo
was destroyed. 
The decision will be made by Judith Rogers, appointed by
former President Bill Clinton, and Thomas Griffith and Brett
Kavanaugh, both appointed by former President George W. Bush. 
Beth Brinkmann, an attorney for the Justice Department,
told the panel that cutting off funding would waste millions of
dollars in already earmarked grants and force scientists to
start research over should Lamberth&#8217;s ruling ultimately be
overturned,. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to&#8221; decide &#8220;upon the wisdom of the
government policy,&#8221; said Griffith. Rather, the court is
deciding whether the funding violates the statute. 
Thomas Hungar, an attorney for stem-cell research
opponents, said government attorneys are only speculating on the
potential harm, and no injury is imminent or irreversible. 
The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 10-5287, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).

A group of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
traders in the U.S. is being pursued by at least three competing
firms including Avenue Capital Group as the investment bank
prepares to break up the unit, according to two people briefed
on the discussions. 
Marc Lasry, founder of Avenue Capital, is courting the
Goldman Sachs team run by Bob Howard to expand his New York-
based firm beyond its focus on distressed and credit investing,
the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are
private, said yesterday. He&#8217;s vying with buyout firm KKR  Co.
and investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP, which also are
negotiating with Howard, people with knowledge of the matter
said Sept. 8. 
Goldman Sachs is disbanding the principal-strategies
business to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk.
Members of the unit, which uses multiple strategies to make bets
with the New York-based firm&#8217;s own money, could go their own way
if an agreement isn&#8217;t reached soon, said Robert Olman, president
of Alpha Search Advisory Partners, a recruitment firm based in
Roslyn, New York. 
&#8220;The longer it takes to work out a deal, the more likely
that members of the team will work something out for themselves
elsewhere,&#8221; Olman said. 
Lasry, 51, declined to comment, as did Ed Canaday, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs. 
Avenue Capital was founded by Lasry and Sonia Gardner in
1995 and managed $18.8 billion at the end of July, according to
its website. The firm says it has more than 300 employees. 
Post-Goldman Options 
The Goldman Sachs group is led globally by Hong Kong-based
Morgan Sze, who may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia,
two people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Sze in March replaced Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP. 
Some of the principal strategies group&#8217;s traders and
support staff may get roles at Goldman Sachs or seek jobs
independently, the people said. 
BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager, also
held talks to hire one or more people from the Goldman Sachs
group, a person with knowledge of the talks said earlier this
month.

An experimental arthritis drug from
Pfizer Inc. reduced pain more than researchers anticipated,
doctors said. It also allowed previously hobbled patients to
overuse and permanently damage their joints. 
Bone destruction developed in 16 of 6,800 patients taking
the medicine, tanezumab, as part of Pfizer&#8217;s development
program, and they all needed a complete joint replacement for
the affected knee, hip or shoulder, according to a report in the
New England Journal of Medicine. Pain-free patients may have put
excessive pressure on their fragile joints because they weren&#8217;t
getting natural pain signals to take it easy, said the lead
researcher, Nancy Lane. 
&#8220;This is more potent than any pain medication I have ever
had in arthritis,&#8221; said Lane, director of the Center for Aging
at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine in
Sacramento, in a telephone interview. &#8220;Because this is a new
chapter in controlling pain, we didn&#8217;t realize we needed to
counsel our patients in using their joints that were still
diseased. Now we need to figure out how to use it so the risks
don&#8217;t outweigh the benefits.&#8221; 
New York-based Pfizer halted studies of the drug for
osteoarthritis, chronic back pain and diabetes-related nerve
disorders at the request of U.S. regulators in June and July.
The market potential for tanezumab and similar medicines was
estimated at $11 billion, Catherine Arnold, a New York-based
managing director at Credit Suisse, wrote in a May 3 note to
investors before the drug problems emerged. 
Talking with FDA 
Pfizer is discussing tanezumab&#8217;s development program with
officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said MacKay
Jimeson, a company spokesman. The definitive cause of the
complication hasn&#8217;t been determined. 
Studies of the drug in patients with cancer pain and
chronic pancreatitis are under way. Publication of the paper
underscores the scientific interest in finding new methods to
treat pain, Jimeson said. 
Lane&#8217;s group studied 450 patients with moderate to severe
osteoarthritis, a disease of the cartilage that protects the
ends of bones in a joint. The tissue absorbs the impact from
movement and allows the bones to slide along each other with
less friction. For 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, the
cartilage wears away, causing pain and swelling and limiting
motion. 
Patients in the study received an injection of tanezumab or
placebo on the first day and during the eighth week of
treatment. Almost half of the patients were already candidates
for joint replacement because of damage. Reduction in knee pain
ranged from 45 percent to 62 percent in those given the Pfizer
drug, depending on the dose, compared with 22 percent for those
given placebo. 
Side Effects 
The most common side effects were headaches, colds and
numbness or tingling of the skin. 
The findings, from the second of three stages needed for
regulatory approval, prompted Pfizer to move the medicine into
final studies. It was in those 13 trials involving 9,100
patients that the rapid progression of arthritis occurred in 16
people, triggering regulators to put the research on hold. 
&#8220;Pain has an important role in the avoidance of self-harm,
but chronic inflammatory pain has generally been considered to
be wholly undesirable,&#8221; said John Wood, professor of
neurobiology at University College London, in an editorial that
accompanied the research. &#8220;The study by Lane et al. suggests
that a complete quenching of pain in patients with
osteoarthritis may not necessarily be a good thing.&#8221; 
Different Joint 
For more than half of the 16 patients, worsening arthritis
and the need for surgery occurred in a joint other than the one
originally targeted in the study, the researchers said. One
patient developed a problem in the shoulder, an uncommon
location for damage from osteoarthritis. 
Tanezumab, a nerve growth factor inhibitor, was considered
one of Pfizer&#8217;s most promising compounds in development. 
Similar treatments are in early stages of development at
Johnson  Johnson of New Brunswick, New Jersey; Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, New York; Sanofi-Aventis SA
of Paris; Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Illinois; and
AstraZeneca Plc of London, Lane said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never worked with anything that&#8217;s been this good for
pain,&#8221; Lane said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s perfect, but it is a
game changer, provided we learn how to use it.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
agreed in July to pay $550 million to settle a U.S. regulator&#8217;s
fraud suit, rolled out an advertising campaign today with ads
that emphasize the firm&#8217;s role in alternative energy and job
creation. 
The ads began in the New York Times and the Wall Street
Journal and will extend to other national, regional and local
newspapers during the next few months, said David Wells, a
spokesman for the New York firm. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable U.S. securities firm in
Wall Street history, is trying to repair a reputation tarnished
by the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit and an April
U.S. Senate hearing at which it was accused of betting against
the investments sold to clients. The ads will feature different
descriptions of the firm&#8217;s business and also appear on the
Internet. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re expanding our communication to a broader audience
in an effort to promote a better understanding of who we are and
what we do,&#8221; Wells said. &#8220;The ads show how we support our
clients, including corporations, municipalities, institutions
and individuals.&#8221; 
In today&#8217;s full-page ads, a photo of a field of wind
turbines under a cloudy sky is juxtaposed with a picture of a
smiling man in a hard hat and work clothes. The ad, carrying the
tag line &#8220;Progress is Everyone&#8217;s Business,&#8221; describes how the
firm helped an unidentified renewable energy company find
investors, enabling it to expand and create jobs. 
&#8216;Mealy-Mouthed&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re apologizing for being bad boys,&#8221;
said Jerry Della Femina, chairman and chief executive officer of
Della Femina/Jeary and Partners in New York, who has worked in
the ad industry since the 1960s. The ad is &#8220;too weak, too
wimpy, too mealy-mouthed,&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;The people who don&#8217;t like them and the people who don&#8217;t
respect them are not going to have their opinion changed by
looking at this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The people who do like them and
respect them may see them as a bit diminished.&#8221; 
Wells declined to disclose the budget for the campaign,
which is being handled by Young  Rubicam Inc., a division of
Dublin-based WPP Plc. 
Goldman Sachs shares fell $2.30, or 1.6 percent, to $142.71
at 10 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have declined 15.5 percent this year compared with a 2.6 percent
gain in the SP 500 Index.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking
to reap HK$15.9 billion ($2.05 billion) from selling shares in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in a transaction that
would give it a fourfold return on its 2006 investment. 
Goldman Sachs is offering 2.75 billion shares at HK$5.70 to
HK$5.79 apiece, according to a term sheet for the proposed sale.
The offer represents a discount of as much as 4.5 percent from
the closing price in Hong Kong today for the world&#8217;s largest
lender by market value. 
The sale follows Goldman Sachs&#8217;s disposal of an almost
$2 billion stake in ICBC in June 2009, when it offloaded the
shares it was free to divest as it repaid bailout funds to the
U.S. government. The New York-based lender will hold a stake
worth about $8 billion in Beijing-based ICBC following the
latest transaction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Shares of ICBC have slumped 7.3 percent in Hong Kong
trading this year, compared with a 2.3 percent gain in the
benchmark Hang Seng Index. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs bought 4.9 percent of ICBC for about $2.59
billion in 2006, when the U.S. bank invested $940 million and
funds managed by the company paid about $1.65 billion for stakes
in ICBC, according to a regulatory filing.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Eric Grossman, its general counsel
for the Americas, as global head of legal. 
Grossman will oversee all of the firm&#8217;s advisory law and
litigation in the newly created position, according to an
internal memo from Frank Barron, who joined the New York-based
company in July as chief legal officer. Jeanmarie McFadden, a
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, confirmed the contents of the memo,
which was obtained today by Bloomberg News. 
Grossman, who also previously was global head of litigation
and general counsel for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was named
to the firm&#8217;s management committee in July. He joined the
company in 2006 shortly after Gary Lynch, who he had worked for
at Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP, became Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chief
legal officer. Grossman had been a candidate to replace Lynch, a
person briefed on the matter said in February. 
Morgan Stanley also named Anne Cooney general counsel of
its brokerage unit, according to the memo. Cooney had previously
been Morgan Stanley Smith Barney&#8217;s deputy general counsel. Jim Mangan and Scott Tucker were named co-heads of litigation,
according to the memo.

Morgan Stanley had its third-
quarter earnings estimates cut by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts, who cited &#8220;soft&#8221; revenue from the firm&#8217;s fixed-
income, currency and commodities and equities divisions. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s earnings-per-share estimate was reduced to
15 cents from 60 cents, analysts led by Richard Ramsden said in
a note to clients dated yesterday. The analysts kept their
&#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on the stock. 
&#8220;Investment bank earnings are likely to be soft in the
third quarter 2010, as evidenced by Jefferies&#8217; shortfall last
week,&#8221; the analysts said. The largest adjustments are due to
&#8220;muted activity&#8221; in fixed income and equities, they said. 
Jefferies Group Inc., the first Wall Street firm to release
third-quarter results, said Sept. 22 that revenue from trading
stocks and bonds dropped 51 percent in the three months though
August. Industry-wide bond-trading volume declined 12 percent in
the period, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Regulatory Authority. 
The analysts also said it&#8217;s hard to gauge the impact of
implementing the Basel capital accords, in particular how the
rules will affect risk-weighted assets and capital ratios.

Chevron Corp.&#8217;s Kazakh oil venture,
the country&#8217;s biggest exporter of the fuel, more than doubled
crude extraction tax payments as the government seeks a larger
share of resource revenue. 
TengizChevroil paid 245.2 billion tenge ($1.7 billion) in
the first seven months, compared with 122 billion tenge in all
of 2009, according to data published on the Finance Ministry&#8217;s
Tax Committee website, without elaboration. 
Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world&#8217;s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, introduced the extraction tax,
replacing royalty payments, to boost revenue and narrow a budget
deficit. The government started levying export taxes on crude
oil from the venture led by Chevron, in the government&#8217;s latest
effort to gain more from the country&#8217;s energy wealth. The
Central Asian nation raised the oil export tax to $20 a metric
ton ($2.73 a barrel) in August and plans to double that to $40
starting next year. 
TengizChevroil increased oil production to 12.5 million
tons in the first half, more than a half of the 22.5 million
tons it produced in 2009, the company said on its website. 
The venture&#8217;s total tax burden rose to 514 billion tenge
through July from 452 billion tenge in all of 2009, the tax
committee said. The venture paid 248 billion tenge in corporate
income tax, compared with 294 billion tenge for all of 2009,
according to the statement. 
Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for TengizChevroil
wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment. Raikhan Sharipova, a
spokeswoman for tax committee, declined to comment immediately. 
Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent.

The U.S. House of Representatives&#8217;
measure passed yesterday, aimed at pushing up the value of the
yuan, is &#8220;bad politics&#8221; and &#8220;bad economics,&#8221; said Stephen S. Roach, non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s an important step on the road to a very
confrontational approach between Washington and China,&#8221; Roach
said today on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with
Tom Keene. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad politics, it&#8217;s bad economics, it&#8217;s not the
right way to deal with this.&#8221; 
The House of Representatives voted yesterday for a measure
that would let domestic companies petition for duties on Chinese
imports to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan. Roach said
the currency charge against China was &#8220;ridiculous,&#8221; and its
government has said the legislation would do nothing to cut the
U.S. trade deficit and would only risk harming growth. 
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we rise to the competitive challenge as we have
always done in the past rather than go after them with some
ridiculous currency charge,&#8221; Roach said. &#8220;This is not a good
approach for an American economy that needs jobs. We&#8217;re going at
this the wrong way.&#8221; 
China, the U.S.&#8217;s third largest export market, should be
encouraged to boost private consumption, said Roach, who added
this could be a &#8220;huge opportunity&#8221; for the U.S. 
The U.S. is enduring persistently high unemployment and a
surge this year in the trade deficit with China, which rose 27
percent to $25.9 billion in July from a year ago. 
&#8220;The big issue in America is jobs,&#8221; Roach said. &#8220;If we
can drive exports into that market that&#8217;s how we can compete and
grow ourselves.&#8221; 
The issue may become a point of contention at the meeting
of Group of 20 nations leaders in Seoul in November, Roach said. 
&#8220;When you have a tough global environment, nobody wants
their currency to get stronger,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a
pretty contentious debate.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. leapfrogged
six competitors including Bank of America Corp. to become this
year&#8217;s top underwriter for California technology companies, amid
a jump in borrowing for acquisitions and stock buybacks. 
JPMorgan has underwritten $3.08 billion in bonds for the
state&#8217;s computer and software makers, winning a 31 percent
share, the largest controlled by a firm since 2007, when it and
Citigroup Inc. split about 80 percent of the market, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan was in a sixth-place tie in
2008 and tied for seventh in 2009. 
Borrowing by companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Adobe Systems Inc. has climbed this year as they seek growth and
look to shore up stock prices after the economic slump. The New
York-based bank, traditionally the national leader in corporate
debt underwriting, is winning business in the state after
navigating the global credit crisis without a quarterly loss. 
&#8220;JPMorgan came out of the financial crisis with a much
stronger franchise in investment banking, partly because of its
acquisition of Bear Stearns, but also because of the strength of
its balance sheet and management,&#8221; Darrell Duffie, a Stanford
University professor of finance, said in an e-mail. &#8220;These
days, no corporate CFO would ever be criticized by the board or
CEO for choosing JPMorgan as its underwriter.&#8221; 
Citigroup, based in New York, ranks second in California
this year through Sept. 15 after underwriting $1.55 billion,
Bloomberg data show. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America is third with $1.38 billion. 
Marketing Advantage 
Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz,
Florida, said underwriters rely on high rankings to win more
business. 
&#8220;Being No. 1 is very important in a given sector,&#8221; Bove
said in a phone interview. &#8220;They go out and say, &#8216;We&#8217;re on top,
and therefore you should do business with us.&#8217; It&#8217;s a major part
of the marketing approach that they use.&#8221; 
Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos and Bank of
America spokesman Kerrie McHugh also declined to comment. 
Borrowing by California technology companies slumped last
year as they shored up their balance sheets and reduced debt
levels in the wake of the credit crisis. Yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds are now the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986, and companies are borrowing again. 
More Acquisitions 
The 159 acquisitions announced by those companies this year
total $16.7 billion, according to Bloomberg data. That compares
with 152 deals worth $14.6 billion in the same period last year. 
At today&#8217;s interest rates, financing debt can make more
sense than spending cash, said Mark MacLennan, head of corporate
finance for Santa Clara, California-based Silicon Valley Bank. 
&#8220;A lot of companies are sitting on huge cash reserves, but
one thing you need to analyze is, where are those cash
reserves?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are they domestic cash or foreign cash
that might have tax ramifications if you repatriate it?&#8221; 
Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software maker, sold
$4.75 billion of bonds earlier this month and may use the
proceeds to fund stock buybacks and acquisitions, the company
said Sept. 22 in a regulatory filing. The company plans to pay
for dividends and stock repurchases because much of its cash is
held overseas, a person familiar with the matter said earlier
this month. Microsoft would have to pay taxes if it brought cash
held abroad to the U.S. 
HP&#8217;s Debt 
HP, the largest personal computer maker, issued debt
through JPMorgan this month totaling about $3 billion. Gina Tyler, a spokeswoman for HP, declined to comment on why it chose
the bank, saying the company doesn&#8217;t talk about outside vendors. 
Palo Alto-based HP announced plans to acquire Palm Inc. for
$1.2 billion in April, followed by 3Par Inc. for $2.35 billion
and ArcSight Inc. for $1.5 billion this month. 
Other companies are plowing money raised into their own
stock, MacLennan said. 
&#8220;Companies&#8217; perceptions are that their shares are probably
on the cheap side, debt interest rates are definitely on the
cheap side, and why not use that to buy back shares or potential
acquisitions?&#8221; he said. 
U.S. companies have announced $258 billion in buybacks
through Sept. 20, compared with $52 billion in the first three
quarters of 2009, according to data compiled by Birinyi
Associates Inc. The almost fivefold increase is the largest for
any January-to-September period since at least 2000, when the
Westport, Connecticut-based research firm started tracking the
data. 
JPMorgan is the largest underwriter of U.S. bonds, with 699
issues this year totaling $171 billion. The bank also held the
top spot in 2009 and 2008, according to Bloomberg data. 
The bank has underwritten 11 debt issues this year for
California-based technology companies, including Adobe, Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., Brocade Communications Systems Inc., Maxim
Integrated Products Inc. and Oracle Corp.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable U.S. securities firm in history, granted stock awards
to its most senior bankers in London after the U.K. government
imposed a one-time tax on bonuses last year, a person briefed on
the discussions said. 
The payments were made in about August and were approved by
the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, said the person, who
declined to be identified as the details are private. The bank
has fewer than 100 partners in London, the person said. A
spokeswoman for the financial watchdog and officials at Goldman
Sachs in London declined to comment. 
Ministers from both the coalition&#8217;s Conservative and
Liberal Democrat parties have urged banks to curb bonuses
following the credit crisis. Business Secretary Vince Cable told
party activists this month banks face &#8220;an enormous kickback&#8221;
from lawmakers if they pay out large bonuses this year. 
&#8220;Banks will take whatever steps they deem as being
commercially necessary to make sure they keep the people they
need to make money,&#8221; said Chris Roebuck, a visiting professor
at the Cass Business School in London. &#8220;These are the tricks of
the trade.&#8221; 
The shares can&#8217;t be sold for five years and may be clawed
back depending on the bank&#8217;s performance, according to Sky News,
which first reported the payments. The awards may be worth in
the high tens of millions of pounds, Sky News reported, citing
unidentified people close to Goldman Sachs. 
Ad Campaign 
The bank, which agreed in July to pay $550 million to
settle a U.S. regulator&#8217;s fraud suit, this week rolled out an
advertising campaign that sought to emphasize the firm&#8217;s role in
alternative energy and job creation. 
The 50 percent levy on discretionary bonus payments of more
than 25,000 pounds ($40,000) raised 3.5 billion pounds for the
Treasury, according to government figures published this month.
That&#8217;s 1 billion pounds more than Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne estimated in June. 
Goldman Sachs said in July the U.K. bonus tax cost it about
$600 million. The firm set aside $9.3 billion to pay its 34,100
employees worldwide in the first half of the year, or an average
of $272,580 per person. That compares with $11.4 billion in the
first half of 2009, which equated to $364,134 for each of the
firm&#8217;s 31,200 employees at the time.

Midwest refiners replenishing
inventories after the Sept. 27 restart of Enbridge Energy
Partners LP&#8217;s Line 6B may extend an eight-week decline in
Cushing, Oklahoma, stockpiles, according to JPMorgan analysts. 
The pipeline was shut after it ruptured July 26, curtailing
heavy crude shipments to refineries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Ontario. As repairs continue, the link is transporting about
245,000 barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 283,000
barrels, Terri Larson, an Enbridge spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail yesterday. 
&#8220;In the very short term, the restart of Enbridge Line 6B
could accentuate the drawdown trend in Cushing as flows are
directed to the refineries affected by the line outage,&#8221;
Lawrence Eagles, head of commodities research at JPMorgan Chase
 Co., said in a note to clients. 
Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, where the New York
Mercantile Exchange crude futures contract is delivered, have
declined for eight consecutive weeks to 34.3 million barrels
last week, from 37.8 million July 30, according to the Energy
Department. 
&#8220;Despite refinery maintenance picking up, it is going to
be harder for inventories to reach capacity before restarts
begin in earnest in November,&#8221; the analysts wrote. 
Refiners conduct overhauls and work on equipment following
the summer driving season when demand traditionally peaks. 
Oil for November delivery rose 90 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$80.87 a barrel at 10:07 a.m. on the Nymex. The discount of
November futures versus the December contract narrowed 8 cents
to 90 cents a barrel. The gap has narrowed from $1.75 on Sept.
17. The discount, known as contango, encourages traders to buy
oil for nearby delivery and store it to sell at a later date. 
&#8220;Spreads already reflect a much higher level of inventory
than is currently in place, but reaching 37 million barrels by
the end of October will be a tough ask,&#8221; analysts wrote. 
Line 6B is a 30-inch pipeline that carries heavy crude oil
from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario.

Walt Disney Co. named Playdom Chief
Executive Officer John Pleasants and James Pitaro, head of
Yahoo! Inc.&#8217;s media unit, co-presidents of the interactive media
group, revamping digital operations to reverse losses. 
The pair replace Steve Wadsworth, a 17-year Disney division
head who left in September, the company said today in a
statement. Pleasants and Pitaro, who start Oct. 18, will oversee
the unit focused on the digital-games market and selling online
sites based on Disney&#8217;s TV shows, movies and characters. 
The appointments will allow Disney, world&#8217;s largest media
company, to build upon the digital assets acquired in the past
three years, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said. The
interactive business lost $130 million through the first nine
months of the year, making it the only unprofitable division. 
&#8220;We see this as a growth area and we need people
experienced in how to best operate them,&#8221; Iger, 59, said in an
interview today. 
Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 24 cents to
$33.34 on Oct. 1. The shares have gained 22 percent during the
past year, compared with an 11 percent increase for the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
In 2007, Disney bought children&#8217;s social network Club
Penguin for $350 million, following that this July with social-
gaming site Playdom, paying $563 million. The company also has
bought Wideload Games and mobile-content site Tapulous. 
Iger said he intends to allow the two men &#8220;freedom&#8221; to
run the units, and Pleasants will keep working from Playdom&#8217;s
office in Palo Alto, California. Iger described the arrangement
as similar to Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Pixar, which operates
mostly independently of Disney&#8217;s film studio. 
Pleasants, a former CEO at Ticketmaster, will oversee
Playdom, Disney&#8217;s Club Penguin, the World of Cars virtual unit
and Tapulous. Pitaro will run Disney.com, Family.com, and its
social-media marketing agency DigiSynd. At Yahoo, Pitaro
expanded Yahoo! Sports and upgraded its news, finance,
entertainment and lifestyle coverage, Disney said.
