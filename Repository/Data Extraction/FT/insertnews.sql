Seven years later, Mr Zeman, a leisure industry veteran known for developing the city''s Lan Kwai Fong bar area, has managed to defy the doubters.</p>
Mainland Chinese visitors to Ocean Park and its trademark dolphin shows have been steadily increasing, while Disney''s cartoon characters have struggled to win them over.</p>
In January this year, Hong Kong Disneyland disclosed its financial details for the first time, revealing a net loss of HK$1.3bn in its last financial year. Although attendance rose slightly to 4.6m in the year to October 3, 2009, it was far short of its original projection of up to 5.6m visitors annually.</p>
By contrast, Ocean Park received 4.8m people in the 12 months to June 2009 and reported a net profit of HK$98.6m. Back in 2003, its attendance was 2.9m and it made a net loss of HK$4.1m.</p>
"We couldn''t compete against Disney with the money they had. We needed to find a way to make us relevant," says Mr Zeman.</p>
"The first thing we realised was that Ocean Park was a local park with local brand awareness."</p>
With that in mind, it began a series of special events during popular festivals such as Chinese New Year and Halloween. It also drew up a HK$5.6bn (US$715m) redevelopment plan that would double the number of shows and rides by 2013, build three on-site hotels and distinguish itself from other theme parks by expanding its animal collection.</p>
"Understanding the culture and coming with the events that are relevant to the local culture is our strength," says Mr Zeman, in the park''s Panda Cafe.</p>
When Disney opened its Hong Kong magic kingdom in 2005, Mr Zeman was prepared for a huge drop in attendance.</p>
Many tourists from mainland China, which since 2004 had become a major source of visitors to Hong Kong, timed their holidays that year to catch the launch of Disneyland.</p>
But due to marketing glitches and complaints about its small size, Hong Kong Disneyland has failed to become the intimidating rival that Ocean Park once feared.</p>
While the tale of a home-grown theme park beating an internationally known name is spectacular, the success of Ocean Park is also unusual as it is not controlled by a cash-rich conglomerate, but wholly-owned by the government.</p>

The two media groups failed to reach an agreement over carriage fees paid to Disney by Cablevision. This is the third such failure in the industry in recent months and underscores the shifting economics of the TV industry.</p>
Free-to-air networks such as ABC and News Corp''s Fox have begun to demand fees from distributors to address the shrinking business of broadcast TV. In the past big station owners such as Disney have taken payment for their cable networks but not for their free-to-air stations.</p>
Carriage discussions are typically tense affairs that last up to the final hours of contract expirations. But recent tussles between networks and carriers have taken on a desperate tone and led to the threat of blackouts of stations.</p>
"It is now painfully clear to millions of New York area households that Disney CEO Bob Iger will hold his own ABC viewers hostage in order to extract $40m in new fees from Cablevision," said Cable-vision. "We call on Bob Iger to immediately return ABC to Cablevision customers while we continue to work to reach a fair agreement."</p>
Disney has demanded an extra $40m in fees, or about $1 a subscriber, on top of the $200m Cablevision pays the network for its roster of popular cable offerings that include the ESPN sports network, which commands the highest fees in the US cable sector.</p>
Fox, which had demanded fees of $1 a subscriber, and Time Warner Cable averted a blackout over the new year after negotiations led to a pact.</p>
"Cablevision has once again betrayed its subscribers by losing ABC7 . . . [following] two years of negotiations, during which we worked diligently, up to the final moments, to reach an agreement," said Rebecca Campbell, president and general manager of WABC-TV, a Disney-owned station, in an online appeal to consumers.</p>
Disney''s saveabc7.com provided contact information for Verizon, DirecTV and ATT so viewers in the region could switch pay TV providers.</p>
John Kerry, the senator who chairs the commerce subcommittee on communications, technology and the internet, last week wrote to Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to urge the FCC to help resolve the dispute.</p>
"When pulling a signal becomes the nuclear option in negotiation, it inflicts collateral damage on consumers who pay their bills and have done nothing wrong," Mr Kerry wrote in a letter to the two companies this weekend.</p>

Disney wants to accelerate the release of the DVD by a month, from 17 weeks after the theatrical opening to 13 weeks.</p>
The aim is to bolster DVD sales, which have been in decline, by allowing the studio to take advantage of marketing to promote the film in cinemas.</p>
But cinema chains are concerned the early DVD release will eat into ticket sales for Alice in Wonderland , a 3D fantasy directed by Tim Burton.</p>
"Disney is not keeping its part of the bargain," Youry Bredewold, a representative for Pathe and the Dutch National Board of Cinema Owners, told AFP.</p>
"There is an agreement between movie distributors and cinema owners that there must be a window of at least four months between the cinema release and the DVD release."</p>
He said that cinema chains representing 80 per cent of the Dutch market would not show the film.</p>
"We will lose money due to our decision," he said. "We expected this to become one of the most popular movies of 2010.</p>
"But we decided we need to send a message to the whole industry: if you don''t accept our terms we will never show your movies again."</p>
As Europe''s largest theatrical market, any boycott in the UK could also have serious repercussions for Disney and the film''s global box office performance.</p>
There are strong ties between the film, which has a large English cast, and the UK: Tim Burton lives in London and the film''s global premiere will be held there on March 5 with Prince Charles as the guest of honour.</p>
No UK cinema chain has yet publicly backed a boycott of the film but there is growing concern about the longer-term implications of the possible shortening of the theatrical release window.</p>
Phil Clapp, chief executive of the Cinema Exhibitors Association in the UK, told the Financial Times that the average release window of about four months had "served both the industry and, more importantly, the customer exceptionally well, evidenced by record cinema admissions and box office".</p>
He said: "The CEA would be concerned by negative impacts arising from any moves to alter that position."</p>
Disney has moved to assuage exhibitors'' fears. "It is important for us to maintain a healthy business on the exhibition side and a healthy business on the home video side," said Bob Chapek, its president of distribution.</p>
"We remain committed to theatrical windows, with the need for exceptions to accommodate a shortened time frame on a case-by-case basis."</p> ', 'Disney film faces Europe boycott', 'By Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles', 'February 18, 2010 2:00 am', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fe246d32-1c2c-11df-86cb-00144feab49a.html') LIMIT 1;

International subscriber growth buoyed the performance of Disney Channel, while ESPN continued to defy the economic downturn with improved advertising revenue, which was offset by higher programming costs.</p>

Hollywood loves a format war. First VHS saw off Betamax in the great home video battle of the 1980s. More recently, Blu-ray won the right to succeed the DVD when it was preferred by film studios to rival HD-DVD technology.</p>
However, as Hollywood looks to the digital era, the industry is split on how to manage the distribution of movies to TVs, computers and hand-held devices, setting the stage for its next great technological tussle.</p>
In one corner is Walt Disney and its Keychest product, which it describes as "enabling technology" that allows consumers to buy or rent a film and then view it on any device they choose.</p>
In the opposing corner is Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem, a coalition of retailers, hardware makers and film companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Netflix and Sony.</p>
Although DECE has taken a slightly different approach to Disney, the two sides essentially have the same goal: to thwart piracy at a time when DVD sales are in decline, and to boost digital sales of movies.</p>
Each camp has publicly played down talk of rivalry. "We''re trying to solve two different problems," says Kelly Summers, vice-president of digital distribution at Walt Disney Studios. "DECE wants to create a new format . . . Keychest isn''t a format. It''s an enabling technology that helps different platforms communicate with each other."</p>
However, analysts and rival studio executives say the absence of Apple from DECE is a telling indication of the fight that may lie ahead. Apple''s iTunes store is the dominant online retailer, responsible for more than 80 per cent of all film download sales, while Steve Jobs, Apple''s chief executive, is Disney''s biggest individual shareholder.</p>
Disney''s decision to go it alone raised eyebrows in Hollywood although the company insists it wanted to move as quickly as possible at a time when digital sales were being held back by online piracy.</p>
In a demonstration for the Financial Times, Arnaud Robert, senior vice- president of distribution technology - and the inventor of the Keychest concept - showed how the "rights locker" concept would work: a consumer could buy a movie via an online retailer and then watch it, within seconds, on a mobile phone or television set.</p>
Disney is in discussion with online retailers and cable TV companies about adopting Keychest. "We need a critical mass to make this work," said Ms Summers. "There''s a competitive reason [for these companies] to be part of this because it increases the utility of devices that are already out there."</p>
Keychest uses all existing digital rights management technologies. DECE, by contrast, has approved five different formats and also agreed on a "common file format" which will be used by all of its members.</p>
Mitch Singer, president of DECE, told the FT that the absence of Apple from the consortium, which also includes Microsoft, Toshiba, Samsung and Intel, would not hold it back. "The digital market is very young and very small . . . change is inevitable. I don''t think any one player controls it in a way that''s going to be [relevant] tomorrow."</p>
Opening up online access so that a single copy of a film could be stored remotely and streamed, regardless of the device, would benefit hardware makers, as well as retailers and film studios, he added.</p>
Disney and DECE will both be at the Consumer Electronics Show, which starts today in Las Vegas, where the two approaches will face further scrutiny from possible partners. "The Keychest-DECE battle is going to be the definitive format war for the digital era," says Arash Amel, senior analyst with Screen Digest, the research firm. "Forget about Blu-ray and DVDs . . this is about who controls digital formats of the next 15-20 years."</p>

Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, is to join Walt Disney as an independent director, bolstering the media company''s board at a time when it is exploring a range of new digital business models.</p>
Assuming her nomination is approved, she will join Steve Jobs as a non-executive director of the company, which has led its rivals in Hollywood in making content available on new digital platforms.</p>
As chief operating officer of Facebook, a position she has held since March 2008, Ms Sandberg is responsible for building the social network''s global operations and managing its sales, marketing, business development, privacy and communications functions.</p>
Facebook has 350m members and is firmly established as the world''s largest online social network since overtaking News Corporation''s MySpace last year.</p>
"Sheryl has been at the forefront of a technological revolution that''s opened up a world of new possibilities for consumers and which has greatly affected the way we do business," said Bob Iger, Disney''s chief executive. "Her unique insight, borne of great practical experience, will be of considerable value to Disney''s shareholders."</p>
Mr Iger has made no secret of his desire to produce content that can be distributed wherever consumers want to view it.</p>
He counts Mr Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, among his most trusted advisers and is keen to explore social networking opportunities for the company, which is where Ms Sandberg''s expertise will come in useful.</p>
The company is currently working on Key Chest, a digital rights management project that will eventually allow consumers to watch Disney content on an array of devices wherever they are.</p>
Disney also operates its own social network for children - Club Penguin - which it acquired two years ago.</p>
Before joining Facebook, Ms Sandberg, who is also on the Starbucks board, was vice-president of global online sales and operations at Google.</p>
She said it was a "tremendous honour" to be nominated to the Disney board, adding that the company had "remained an entertainment icon around the world for over 80 years by enthusiastically embracing change and new technologies".</p>
John Pepper, Disney''s chairman, said that Ms Sandberg had "great expertise in the online world, considerable international experience and a deep understanding of consumer behaviour".</p>
Ms Sandberg is a former chief of staff of the United States Treasury Department.</p>
Her previous posts also include serving as a management consultant with McKinsey and working as an economist with the World Bank.</p>

Mr Watson, who has only been in the top job at the US''s second-biggest oil company for three months, is confident that his decision not to follow the pack into US shale gas is the right one to make.</p>
"We haven''t seen the returns," he told the Financial Times.</p>
The Chevron chief''s comments come against a backdrop of US gas producers struggling against low oil prices as a result of an</p>
oversupply.</p>
Many in the industry believe that governments worldwide, under pressure to lower their dependence on carbon fuels, will increasingly turn to natural gas until the technology is available to enable renewables to meet a substantial portion of the demand for electricity.</p>
Shale gas is about 30 per cent less carbon intensive than oil and 50 per cent less so than coal.</p>
Its supporters argue that new drilling technology has strengthened the economic case for tapping the gas, giving it a key role to play in bolstering the US''s energy security.</p>
The new techniques have led to increased projections of reserves of shale gas from 30 years'' worth of supplies, at current usage rates, to 100 years.</p>
In December, Exxon-Mobil, the US''s biggest oil company, agreed to buy XTO Energy for its strong position in shale gas, for $31bn in stock and $10bn in XTO debt.</p>
That deal has followed a string of others in the past two years, which have seen BP and BG Group of the UK, StatoilHydro, the Norwegian energy company, Eni, the Italian oil company, and other smaller companies, buying into US shale gas fields.</p>
Mr Watson has also taken a contrarian position on Iraq, where other oil majors have rushed to bid for the right to develop the country''s oilfields.</p>
He said that he was "hopeful" Chevron would have a role to play in developing fields in Iraq. But in spite of Iraq''s "vast oilfields" and the time that Chevron spent training in the country, he said that the risks and the way the fiscal system was structured meant that Iraq could not compete with other opportunities Chevron currently had.</p>
So, instead of putting in a low bid, knowing that it would inevitably fail, Chevron opted out.</p>
"We just didn''t see value," Mr Watson said. "It has to pass the hurdle."</p>
The chief executive is, however, considering the value of jumping the hurdles to oil and gas production in Russia.</p>
At a time when Conoco-Phillips is selling half of its stake in Lukoil, Russia''s largest independent oil company, Mr Watson said: "What we''re hearing out of Moscow is encouraging."</p>

The national oil company is pushing CNOOC, the Chinese state-owned oil company, to make a counterbid for Kosmos, the small US-based company that ExxonMobil last week decided to acquire by signing an exclusive binding agreement worth more than $4bn (2.7bn, 2.5bn).</p>
Kosmos, which discovered the oilfield during the previous Ghanaian presidency, has fallen out of favour with the government, according to industry insiders. It is backed by Blackstone and Warburg Pincus, the private equity groups, which stand to generate a fourfold return on the deal.</p>
GNPC''s decision runs the risk of undermining the reputation of Ghana as one of west Africa''s more stable and transparent countries for investors, analysts said. Robin West, chief executive of PFC Energy, the consultancy, said: "The Ghanaians run a serious risk if they disrupt this sales process. It could delay projects and chill investments."</p>
Several international and national oil companies bid for Kosmos. But, CNOOC was not among them, people close to the Chinese company said. Instead, CNOOC conducted parallel talks with GNPC, which hired Morgan Stanley to advise it. Meanwhile, the sale of Kosmos was delayed by several months.</p>
Joseph Oteng-Adjei, Ghana''s energy minister, told the Financial Times at the time he had not wanted to block the sale process and that he had wanted to protect Ghana''s interests "without cheating or dec-eiving anyone who has benefited the country by investing in our oil industry".</p> ', 'Ghana moves to block Exxon bid', 'By Carola Hoyos in London', 'October 13, 2009 3:00 am', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://www.ft.com/cms/a473c1d6-b78f-11de-9812-00144feab49a.html') LIMIT 1;

The largest western oil group is buying Kosmos Energy, the stake holder that is backed by Blackstone and Warburg Pincus, the private equity groups. The deal would generate about a four times return for the pair, which invested $800m in Kosmos.</p>
The Kosmos sale was first mooted at the end of last year and attracted interest from many of the world''s big oil groups. But the deal was delayed by Ghana, which felt left out of the sale process.</p>
The country''s national oil company had tried to mount a bid for Kosmos, people close to the Ghanaian government said, but it has failed to raise the capital or push down the price.</p>
Exxon''s offer still needs the approval of the Ghanaian government and details of the deal have not yet been disclosed.</p>
The Jubilee field, discovered in 2007 off the coast of Ghana, is divided into two licence areas. Kosmos has a stake of almost 31 per cent in one, and 18 per cent in the other. Anadarko of the US and the UK''s Tullow are the other big shareholders.</p>
Dallas-based Kosmos was founded by Jim Musselman and Brian Maxted, two former executives of Triton Energy, which discovered the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea, before being sold for $3.2bn to Amerada Hess in 2001.</p>
Kosmos wrote to all bidders on Monday night telling them the sale process had ended after it reached an "exclusive binding agreement" with Exxon.</p>
Analysts have been expecting ExxonMobil, with its large cash position, to make acquisitions since the economic and credit crisis began. But it has said it was waiting for prices to stabilise. The deal also underscores a growing interest in west Africa by the oil majors, which have been limited in their ability to expand by rising resource nationalism in places such as Russia and Venezuela.</p>
But Neil McMahon, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, questioned the deal''s logic, given that it does not give it a majority stake, operatorship or the potential to make greater profits through further exploration. He called it "an odd deal". "What''s the up side? It makes it feel like they are betting on the oil price upside and Exxon never bets on the oil price," he said.</p>
